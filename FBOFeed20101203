<RESPDATE>091709
<CONTACT>David Diniz, Contract Specialist, Phone 3106533859, Email david.diniz@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC><p>The United States Air Force Space and Missile System Center (SMC), Launch and Range Systems Wing (LRSW), is contemplating issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) to United Launch Services, L.L.C. for Launch Services in support of mission L-36. Only one (1) new mission will be added to the existing EELV Launch Services (ELS) contract with United Launch Services, L.L.C. This Launch Service for Mission L-36 will include requirements for the following: Core Vehicle and Upper Stage, Payload Fairing, Payload Adaptor, Mission Unique Hardware, Mission Assurance Instrumentation, and Booster Storage Costs (if required). The RFP may be issued 15 days after publication of this Notice of Contract Action (NOCA). The Government may elect not to award any launch service (described above) as a result, of this solicitation.
<p>FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(i) states, "Full and open competition need not be provided for when it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source or sources in order to maintain a facility, producer, manufacturer, or other supplier available for furnishing supplies or services in case of a national emergency or to achieve industrial mobilization." A J&amp;A may permit Government missions to be awarded with less than full and open competition to United Launch Services, L.L.C. subject to the Competition in Contracting Act.</p>
<p>The Launch and Range Systems Wing (LRSW) is developing a New Entrant Evaluation Plan (NEEP). The NEEP will define a structured approach for the Wing to evaluate potential new entrants to perform EELV launch services. A "new entrant" is any contractor other than current providers of EELV launch services. The evaluation plan will identify the business and technical requirements for a new entrant to be eligible for award of launch services. A business evaluation will determine the responsibility of the new entrant, including financial resources, organization and functional expertise, adequacy of production and launch operations facilities, and the ability to obtain necessary construction and environmental permits. A technical evaluation will determine the new entrant's understanding of, and ability to meet, EELV systems requirements, design maturity, adequacy of development and qualification activities, manufacturing process quality, and demonstrated system flight worthiness. The result of the new entrant evaluation process will be a formal determination by the Commander, LRSW, submitted to and approved by the Commander, Space and Missile Center, as to the ability of the new entrant to compete for EELV launch services. The intent of this plan is to ensure new entrants are provided a prompt opportunity to demonstrate their abilities (at their own expense), while protecting the Government's need to acquire systems that meet requirements. Any interested parties or new entrants may contact the PCO (address below) about receiving a copy of the NEEP when published. Responses from Small Businesses are encouraged. NAICS Code is 541712 with 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>Any interested parties (or new entrants) must be: (1) U.S. manufacturers as defined in the in the 2005 Buy 3 Request for Proposal; (2) have successfully demonstrated two missions (intermediate or larger) that inserts payloads into their intended orbits; (3) meet the system requirements identified in the Operational Requirements Document (ORD II) as presented in the March 2005 System Performance Requirements Document (SPRD) for Buy 3; and (4) successfully completed the new entrant evaluation criteria (described above), at their own expense. Firms that do not perform under the Low Cost Concept Validation, Engineering and Manufacturing Development, and Initial Launch Services contracts, yet believe they can satisfy technical requirements and solicitation provisions as contractors for the EELV launch services, are encouraged to submit a Statement of Capability and qualification (limited to four (4) pages, with Times New Roman 12 point font , and 1inch top, bottom, left and right margins) addressing the above criteria within seven (7) calendar days of this synopsis to: LRSW/PK, Attn: Richard Ross, 483 North Aviation Blvd, El Segundo, CA 90245-2808. Prior EELV experience has shown that the new entrant certification time period may be longer than the acquisition timeline for the mission identified in this NOCA. Therefore, other interested parties are welcome to use this NOCA and the described New Entrant Evaluation Plan to initiate activity towards qualifying their launch system for future EELV launch services. This synopsis is not a formal solicitation. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this synopsis, nor to otherwise pay for the information solicited herein.</p>

<CONTACT>Steve Manley, 202-385-8676

<a href="mailto:steve.manley@faa.gov">steve.manley@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>This announcement advises that FAA will hold an industry day to discuss a proposed FAA specification for manufacture of airport ADS-B vehicle transponders.
The FAA Surveillance and Broadcast Program Office posted Announcement Number 9690 entitled "Vehicle Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) - Draft Specification and Advisory Circular" on July 2, 2010.  The announcement detailed FAA's plans to establish specification requirements for use of ADS-B equipment on airport surface vehicles, aside from aircraft, in order to mitigate safety risks on airport movement areas.    These specification requirements apply to vehicles equipped with the ability to transmit Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) messages.  The transmitted messages will be displayed on traffic displays for both air traffic control and aircraft operators who choose to equip with the ability to receive ADS-B information.   
This will not result in an FAA acquisition.  As stated in the July 2, 2010 announcement, the specification provides the basis for manufacture of the transponders.  The transponders will be qualified through FAA testing.  Airport authorities will purchase the transponders from qualified vendors.  Use of vehicle transponders at airports is not mandatory; however, airport authorities have expressed interest in vehicle transponders.  
The July 2, 2010 announcement asked industry to submit comments on the draft documents.       
The FAA has reviewed the received comments and has updated the draft specification.    This updated document is attached hereto, as well as a matrix of comments received.  
Industry input to these documents is appreciated.   
The FAA will proceed to internally coordinate the draft document.  Based on that coordination, the attached document may not be final.  
FAA will conduct an industry day in order to familiarize attendees with the vehicle ADS-B specification and the proposed FAA test approach to ensure specification compliance.  The presentation will be directed to potential vehicle transponder manufacturers; however, other interested parties may attend.  
Vendors are encouraged to submit questions no later than December 14, 2010 via E-mail to Steve.Manley@faa.gov.  The FAA will also conduct one-on-one discussions with vendors as requested.  Additional presentations may be held in the future.     
The industry day will occur on December 17, 2010 at FAA Headquarters, 800 Independence Avenue, Washington D.C. 20591 from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM in the second floor Bessie Coleman Conference room.
Interested parties are asked to contact Ms. Amy Kirkham at akirkham@regulus-group.com in order to confirm attendance.      
The July 2, 2010 announcement can be accessed at https://faaco.faa.gov/ by archive keyword "manley".   Interested parties should access this announcement for background information.   
All communications and questions shall be directed to Stephen B. Manley by E-mail at:Steve.Manley@FAA.gov.

<CONTACT>Lynnette Desorcie, Senior Contracting Officer, Phone 703-696-4324, Email lynnette.desorcie@navy.mil
<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is interested in receiving white papers and proposals to foster new developments in Science and Technology (S&amp;T) which may ultimately lead to future operational capabilities beyond those represented by current acquisition programs and requirements. As such, it is anticipated that successful proposals would ultimately contribute to the S&amp;T underpinning from which future Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare and Combating Terrorism warfighting requirements and capabilities may become possible.
<p>Efforts in this BAA are divided into major investments areas, each representing operational functions critical to Naval Expeditionary Warfare. Background information and specific areas of interest for new contracts or grants are described in the Research Opportunity Description for each investment area. Potential Offerors focusing on applied research and advanced technology proposals should understand that ONR will give priority consideration to technology proposals that fully address the desired capability. Innovative approaches with promise of revolutionary capability that address a subset will be considered. Emphasis on capabilities means that Offerors should: a) propose development that will result in a warfighting capability that can be measured in quantitative terms and found to be "game changing;" b) address the transformational capability being required by the Department of Defense, particularly the development of a Naval Expeditionary S&amp;T enterprise; c) leverage or complement other relevant developmental research areas; d) state clearly how the proposed technology development will meet warfighter needs; and e) be oriented toward rapid maturation, demonstration, and transition.</p>
<p>Work funded under a BAA may include basic research, applied research and some advanced technology development (ATD). With regard to any restrictions on the conduct or outcome of work funded under this BAA, ONR will follow the guidance on and definition of "contracted fundamental research" as provided in the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) Memorandum of 26 June 2008. As defined therein the definition of "contracted fundamental research", in a DoD contractual context, includes [research performed under] grants and contracts that are (a) funded by Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation Budget Activity 1 (Basic Research), whether performed by universities or industry or (b) funded by Budget Activity 2 (Applied Research) and performed on campus at a university or by industry. ATD is funded through Budget Activity 3. In conformance with the USD(AT&amp;L) guidance and National Security Decision Directive 189, ONR will place no restriction on the conduct or reporting of unclassified fundamental research, except as otherwise required by statute, regulation or Executive Order. Normally, fundamental research is awarded under grants with universities and under contracts with industry. ATD is normally awarded under contracts and may require restrictions during the conduct of the research and DoD pre-publication review of research results due to subject matter sensitivity. Potential offerors should consult with the appropriate ONR POCs to determine whether the proposed effort would constitute basic research, applied research or ATD.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Kathey K Thury, Contracting Officer, Phone (817) 978-7349, Fax (817) 978-7017, Email kathey.thury@gsa.gov
<DESC><br />The General Services Administration (GSA), Region 7, is seeking a qualified construction firm to provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary for the construction of the New Tornillo-Guadalupe Land Port of Entry (LPOE) located in Tornillo, Texas. The site is located in El Paso County, Texas. It is situated approximately 30 miles east of El Paso in adjacent to the current Fabens Land Port of Entry facility, which is scheduled to be demolished as part of Phase II of the new construction project. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 236220. The size standard is $33.5million per year. This is an unrestricted procurement open to all large and small business concerns.
<p>Due to Document Security Requirements (GSA Directive PBS 3490.1A, 06/01/2009) on the project all firms shall e-mail a one page letter of interest on company letter head to the GSA Contracting Officer at kathey.thury@gsa.gov. This letter shall include a statement of interest, a Point of Contact (POC) (inclusive of POC phone number, fax number and e-mail address) the number of personnel that will attend the Pre-proposal Conference and the company DUNS # as listed in Central Contractor Registration (CCR), at https://www.ccr.gov. Letters are due to the GSA Contracting Officer no later than December 20, 2010. If a firm is not registered in CCR then they must submit in addition to the above a copy of a valid business license, and Tax ID #. It is strongly recommended that all firms register as an interested party in FedBizOpps https://www.fbo.gov. Firms must submit an e-mail with their interest and requested information stated above to gain access to the RFP documents. GSA retains the right to publish and distribute the list of offerors to other interested parties (i.e., subcontractors, etc.).</p>
<p>The Estimated Construction Cost at Award for this project is $50,000,000 to $70,000,000. Contractors should price according to the construction specifications, drawings and any other contractual documents. The Request for Proposal (RFP), solicitation, drawings and additional contractual documents are scheduled to be issued on or about December 21, 2010 via FedBizOpps. All questions/clarifications regarding the project documents (drawings, specifications, procedures, etc.) shall be put in writing to the GSA Contracting Officer, kathey.thury@gsa.gov no later than close of business January 12, 2011. Technical and price is tentatively scheduled to be due to the Contracting Officer on or about January 27, 2011. Production, printing costs and proposal preparation costs are at the expense of the offeror. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial technical and price proposals without discussions.</p>
<p>The Design Architect is Richter Architects. The Government on-site Construction Manager (CMa) is Coast and Harbor Associates. Do not contact the Design Architect or CMa for information on this project. The construction start is presently scheduled for March/April 2011. The project duration is 764 calendar days which includes the completion of both Phases I and II. GSA intends to award a Firm-Fixed Priced (FFP) contract for construction services, to the contractor that offers the best overall value to the Government. The contractor will be chosen competitively utilizing FAR Part 15 Source Selection procedures in conjunction with the Best Value/Trade-off process. Therefore, combined technical evaluation factors will be significantly more important than cost or price. There are two Construction Phases to be performed by the contractor under this project. Phase I will be the construction of the New Tornillo-Guadalupe LPOE and Phase II will be the demolition of the existing Fabens LPOE. The technical factors are tentatively as follows: (#1) Past Performance and Experience of the Construction Firm on Similar Projects; (#2) Past Performance, Experience and Qualification of Key Personnel; (#3) Detailed Project Management Plan and Technical Approach; and (#4) Project Labor Agreement (PLA).</p>
<p>An estimated 115 acres will compose the new LPOE. Both the land donation and the delivery of utilities to the perimeter of the site will be completed by El Paso County. The new LPOE will be a full-service port and will include non-commercial facilities (import and export) including POV canopies, an Administration Building, a Secondary Head House; commercial facilities (import and export) including truck canopies, docks, and Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) systems; a canine kennel; a central plant; and Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission (TABC) and Federal Motor Carriers Safety Administration (FMCSA) facilities. The total building area (including canopies) is 86,600 GSF. Site work includes roadways, drainage retention ponds, and 160 exterior parking spaces. The construction of this project will take place on land located near the existing port of entry, which shall remain operational on a continuous 24 hours, 7 days a week effort, No interruptions to the existing LPOE shall be allowed.<br /><br />The new proposed site is located within the El Paso-Juarez Valley. The El Paso-Juarez Valley broadens into a valley of four to five miles in width below El Paso, Texas. The proposed site falls within the boundary of the Chihuahuan Desert where basin and range topography characterize the region. There is little drainage that flows through the region; consequently, the Rio Grande is one of the few areas of erosional lowland. The proposed new LPOE site is located adjacent to the Rio Grande River and the topography consists of a level to gently sloping surface. This new LPOE will also alleviate congestion and overextended resources at neighboring Ports. In addition, new facilities will improve working conditions for employees and tenants at the current location. Increased traffic flow through this area with the establishment of new LPOE facilities will encourage economic growth for the neighboring communities of Fabens and Tornillo on the United States side and Casetas on the Mexico side. The new Tornillo-Guadalupe International Bridge will be built as a separate project by El Paso County as a toll bridge and a revenue collection point for the County it will be located just to the north of the new LPOE.</p>
<p>This project is designed to comply with a Certification Level according to the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy &amp; Environmental Design (LEED), Silver Level Rating System. The project must achieve at a minimum the LEED&reg; certified Silver rating, with higher rating levels strongly encouraged.</p>
<p>A Pre-Proposal Conference will be held at the Federal Building located in Downtown El Paso, TX on January 5, 2011at 1:00 pm (MST), and a site visit will be conducted after the Pre-Proposal Conference. Additional information for the conference will be provided in the RFP.</p>
<p>This is A Full and Open Procurement. This procurement is open to all business concerns. Although this procurement is open to large business, small women-owned, service disabled veteran owned and minority-owned firms are strongly encouraged to participate. Large business will be required to submit an acceptable Subcontracting Plan per the RFP and place subcontracts with small businesses to the maximum practical extent.</p>

UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT 
Expressions of Interest Sought 
Rockville, Maryland


The United States Government currently occupies approximately 82,873 BOMA rentable square feet (brsf) of office and related space at 6100 Executive Boulevard., Rockville, MD under a lease that will be expiring.  The Government has a continuing need for the above stated space requirement.  

The Government is seeking to lease approximately 82,873 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 74,300 of contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet.  The lease term requirement is for five (5) years  with cancellation rights beginning on the second (2rd) anniversary date of the lease.  The space must be available for occupancy by September 21, 2010.  

Delineated Area:

North: Halpine Road to Twinbrook Parkway
East: Viers Mill Road to Connecticut Avenue 
West: East Jefferson Street, Rollins Avenue, Evelyn Dr., Montrose Road, Tadenwood Drive, Old Stage Road, Tilden Park, Tuckerman Lane I-270, Democracy Blvd., Old Georgetown Road, Wisconsin Avenue. 
South: Bradley Lane 

Other requirements applicable to this requirement include:

All services, supplies, utilities and tenant alterations are to be provided as part of the rental consideration.  The offered space must be near inexpensive and moderately priced fast food and/or eat-in restaurants.  Other employee services such as retail shops, cleaners, and banks shall be located within 1 mile.  The offered space must meet GSA requirements for security, seismic, and fire protection and life safety and handicapped accessibility (ABAAS).  

The Government is considering whether to remain in its existing lease space or relocate to alternative space.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, non-productive agency downtime, etc.

Expressions of interest must be submitted in writing and must include the following information:

	Building name and address.

	Rentable Square Feet (RSF) available and expected rental rate per rentable square foot, fully serviced.

ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF) to be offered and expected rental rate per OASF, fully serviced .

	Date of space availability.

	Method of rentable space measurement.

	Name, address, telephone number, and email address of Owners Representative.

	Owners name and address and written statement from owner identifying Owners Representative and granting it authority to provide information on the property.

	Parking Availability

The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.  The Governments decision regarding whether or not to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.  In the event that a potential offeror fails to provide specific rental rate or other required information as part of its response to this advertisement, the Government reserves the right to assume that the potential building in question cannot meet the Governments requirements.  With specific respect to expected rental rate information, the Government will assume the maximum rental rate authorized in the applicable lease prospectus related to this requirement in the event the respondent fails to include such information.

All services, supplies, utilities and tenant alterations are to be provided as a part of the rental considerations. If anyone has a location they would like to have considered, please contact April Campbell at (404) 562-0896 by 5:00 PM EST, December 17, 2010.</p>

Contractor representatives without the appropriate PPE will not be allowed access to the facility and additional site visits will not be scheduled as a result of such failure.

6.  The purpose of the site visit is to allow contractors the opportunity to inspect the site of the existing equipment (where the new equipment is to be installed) in order to be better able to relate to the specification requirements.  The site visit, in conjunction with the work requirements identified in the final specification, should provide contractors a detailed understanding of the requirement.

7.
  The site visit is not intended to be a pre-proposal conference and therefore will NOT be an open forum for questions.  Contractors must submit questions concerning, or request clarification of, any aspect of the draft specification electronically via e-mail to willie.humphrey@usmc.mil no later than 25 January 2011.   Comments and questions must reference Request for Quotation M00146-11-T-9014.  

8.  Failure of a contractor to submit questions regarding this requirement or to attend the Site Visit will be construed to mean that the contractor fully understands all requirements of the final specification and Request for Quotation.  In no event will failure of a contractor to submit questions or inspect the site constitute grounds for a claim after contract award.
  

9.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:  Interested contractors should continue to monitor the NECO web sites for additional information and documents relating to this requirement.

<CONTACT>Keith Austin, Email keith.austin@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>Process Improvements for Document Handling Study

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of qualified small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, HUBZone firms, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) to provide support to the FDA to develop process improvements for document storage policies and practices to facilitate consolidated storage at FDAs White Oak Campus.

Background:
A study was recently completed to identify recommendations to improve processes for handling FDA documents and official records from its many Centers.  The study explored factors for a Selective Integrated Records Facility (SIRF) to be located on the White Oak campus.  The study determined the statutory responsibilities of each Center and the Agency for the handling and storage of confidential documents, the retention policies, the use patterns of these documents, the use and delivery of these documents from petitioners and the steps for retrieval and delivery of these documents to each user and return and refiling of documents.  

Objectives:
The intent is to bring the FDA into compliance with the October 21, 1998 Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA).  The contractor will create best practices based on these process improvements and FDA will implement them after careful review.  FDA appreciates the concept of a SIRF but feels more comfortable with a FIRF or Fully Integrated Records Facility.  FDA wants specific requirements developed for a Fully Integrated Records Facility.   

Contractor must show experience in consultation regarding document record facilities operation and planning.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)Product Manager (PM) Area Processing Centers (APC) Army Enterprise Service Desk - Spiral 2December 3, 2010
1.	INTRODUCTIONThis Request for Information (RFI) is being issued by the Army Program Executive Office Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS) and the Product Manager (PM) Area Processing Centers (APC).  The goal of this RFI is to aid the U.S. Army in acquiring performance-based Army Enterprise Service Desk (AESD) services in support of the Active, Guard, and Reserve  Army, Department of Army Civilians and entitled Contractors, Friends, and Family.  PEO EIS is the Army's systems acquisition, development and integration center of excellence.   The PEO EIS mission is to enable information dominance by developing, acquiring, integrating, and deploying enterprise-wide, network-centric information management and communications to meet Army's current and future mission requirements.Under the management of four deputy program executive officers, five directorates and many project/product managers, PEO EIS develops and fields a wide range of products and services that support the Army.  PEO EIS is dedicated to supporting the Warfighter and contributes to the global war on terror and the war in Southwest Asia and through its diverse programs - PEO EIS touches every soldier, every day.  
2.	ABOUT THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATIONThis is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Quotation (RFQ), or an invitation for bid, nor does its issuance obligate or restrict the Government to an eventual acquisition.  All information received from this RFI will be used for Market Research purposes only.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses to this RFI nor otherwise reimburse vendors for the preparation of any information submitted or Government use of such information.  Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified regarding the outcome of the information received.Subsequent to the receipt of responses to this RFI, the Program Executive Office Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS) may invite select RFI respondents to a technical interchange session to discuss their response with Government representatives.

3.	BACKGROUNDThe Army is transitioning towards a service management model which promotes a total customer focus in order to better deliver Information Technology (IT) services to the Warfighter.  The Enterprise Service Desk / Enterprise Support Management System (ESD/ESMS), based upon the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) framework, are critical enablers of this service management paradigm.  As the Army begins to operationalize LandWarNet (LWN) on a global scale, unifying theater-based operations for the delivery of Information Technology (IT) services through regional Network Service Centers (NSCs), there is a continuing need for an Army-wide ESD across a number of subordinate and federated organizations to ensure reliable IT service support to LWN IT service consumers.  This ESD will be implemented incrementally, and it is envisioned that each ESD increment will support a larger portion of LWN IT Services until all services are supported.  The ESD is enabled by an underlying Enterprise Support Management System (ESMS). The ESMS has two primary roles.  First, the ESMS has codified workflows supporting the ITIL processes of incident, problem, change, and configuration management. These workflows ensure that Service Support is executed in a repeatable manner across the Enterprise.  Second, it contains asset inventory data, performance data, capacity data, and data about relationships to other assets, people, and services.  These data facilitate the ESD's LWN service support mission.The Enterprise Service Desk, based on the principles of the ITIL V3 framework, is the single point of entry for all IT support services for LandWarNet.  The ESD, supported by the ESMS and the related services required for continued and effective operation of this critical Army capability are collectively known as the Army Enterprise Service Desk or AESD.  Optimal acquisition of these services is the focus of this Request for Information.

5.	PRELIMINARY ACQUISITION STRATEGYIn support of the AESD mission, the Army intends to award three (3) or four (4) indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts, competed through full-and-open competition in accordance with FAR Part 15 procedures.  (The Army reserves the right to award a different number of awards if deemed in its best interest.)  These awards will result in a small, selective, and highly qualified group of Contract holders who will then compete for specific Task Orders to provide a variety of critical services encompassing a wide range of in-scope services. Task Orders will be structured in a variety of ways depending on technology, performance, and accountability interdependencies.   Benefits of competition will also be considered in Task Order design.  For example, Task Orders for Service Desk support may be organized by "accounts" (customer organizations) allowing for ongoing competition of new requirements as they arise. Initially, the Army anticipates first competing and awarding one (1) Task Order with the Contract Solicitation and then competing two (2) Task Orders among the three or four Contract Holders immediately after Contract award.  These Task Orders (preliminary and subject to change) are anticipated to encompass detailed requirements in the following areas:
1.	Task Order 001: ESMS and the Call Handling Solution a.	Scope Area 1: Task Order Managementb.	Scope Area 2: Transition Planning and Executionc.	Scope Area 4: Call Handling Solutiond.	Scope Area 7: ESMS Fieldinge.	Scope Area 8: Enterprise Support Management System Development, Configuration, and Release Managementf.	Scope Area 9: Enterprise Support Management System (ESMS) Operations Support
2.	Task Order 002: Enterprise Service Desk - Customer Organization 1a.	Scope Area 1: Task Order Managementb.	Scope Area 2: Transition Planning and Executionc.	Scope Area 3: Enterprise Service Desk   d.	Scope Area 6: ESD Fielding
3.	Task Order 003: Enterprise Service Desk - Customer Organization 2a.	Scope Area 1: Task Order Managementb.	Scope Area 2: Transition Planning and Executionc.	Scope Area 3: Enterprise Service Desk   d.	Scope Area 6: ESD Fielding

<DESC>This sources sought notice is issued for information and planning purposes only. This announcement is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and does not commit the Government to solicit or award a contract now or in the future. No solicitation is available at this time. <br />
<p><br />The purpose of this notice is to identify sources with the requisite qualifications that could provide the service stated herein. All small business concerns (SB, 8(a), SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB and SDVOSB) capable of performing the requirement indicated below are encouraged to respond to this notice.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Information Technology Laboratory's (ITL) Information Access Division's Retrieval Group works with industry, academia and other government agencies to promote the use of more effective and efficient techniques for manipulating information not specifically structured for automatic use-especially the browsing, searching, and presentation of that information. Accurate evaluation of the capabilities of current information access systems is a prerequisite to improving the systems' capabilities. Human-created annotations are essential to the evaluation of information systems. Examples of these annotations include identification of documents that are relevant to a searcher's need, hand-written summaries of documents and sets of documents, and answers to questions. These annotations are fundamental to comparing the performance of automatic information systems, and understanding those differences within the range of performance that people achieve at the same tasks. The Group is seeking to identify sources with the capability to create annotations to support the evaluation of automatic natural language and video processing systems.</p>
<p>Contractor support for performing tasks similar to the following is anticipated to be needed in the near future:</p>
<p>&bull; indicating which documents in a set of given documents are relevant to an information need;<br />&bull; summarizing document clusters;<br />&bull; finding duplicate documents within a document set;<br />&bull; determining whether two texts are semantically equivalent (i.e., convey essentially the same information).</p>
<p>More generally, the contractor will create annotations to be used in test sets for evaluating natural language processing and search tasks. Because humans can differ in their opinions as to the correct annotation for a given test case, a variety of individual annotators is required. This action would require the Contractor to provide 20-30 different individuals, each of whom would work approximately 150 hours per year.</p>
<p>Sources that have the ability to provide this contracting support are asked to respond to this notice with a capability statement of a maximum of ten (10) pages to provide a clear and complete narrative of current capabilities to meet the Retrieval Group's mission. Those sources are requested to respond to this notice and in so doing, provide the following information: organization information to include company name and address, size of business as it relates to NAICS code 541990 (size standard $7 million), current point of contact (including telephone number, facsimile number and e-mail address), list of current GSA schedule contracts under which your company can provide services in one or more of the applicable task areas, and a list of contracts within the past three (3) years under which the interested party has performed the same or similar work. All responses shall be emailed to keith.bubar@nist.gov so that they are received no later than 5:00 pm EST December 29, 2010.</p>

MCEITS BACKGROUND
Marine Corps Enterprise Information Technology Services (MCEITS) is a core enabler of computing and communications capabilities of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force Command and Control (MAGTF C2) Framework and the Marine Corps C2 System of Systems (SoS).
  MCEITS enables access to enterprise information and provides a collaborative sharing environment for information/services across the business and warfighter domains.  These capabilities will be attained by integrating primarily commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) information technology (IT) components under an integrated enterprise architecture that enables the creation of a net-centric environment.  This environment is comprised of a consolidated infrastructure to support legacy and virtual application services and data environments, with a common validation and inclusion process. This new infrastructure initially resides in two Enterprise Information Technology Centers (EITCs) located in Kansas City, Missouri and Albany, Georgia.
  It will also include a Service Integration Environment (SIE) for validation and deployment of applications, services and data to be located in Kansas City, Missouri.

The Marine Corps net-centric capability is enabled via the Enterprise Application Environment (EAE) and the Enterprise Services and Data Environment (ESDE) that is instantiated in the EITCs. These program elements form the Enterprise Services Layer of the MAGTF C2 Framework. The EAE hosts and provides access to MCEITS-provided applications, as well as other enterprise-class services, via an Enterprise Portal Framework (EPF). The MCEITS services allow the Marine Corps to deliver solutions that range from hosting systems to providing enterprise-wide services.
 The ESDE provides the environment for net-centric interoperability by enabling the sharing of data and services, monitoring the enterprise-wide discovery of people, content and services. The overall MCEITS environment is managed through MCEITS Operations Center (MOC) functional capabilities that will be integrated into the Marine Corps Network Operations and Security Center (MCNOSC).

MCEITS will field the application and service hosting infrastructure for the Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN) with the hardware, software, and facilities infrastructure required to support MCEITS-hosted, non-managed hosted or provisioned applications and also the Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) necessary to enable collaboration and provide access to trusted information.
  MCEITS platforms provide information access and collaboration capability for Marine Corps users and begin the net-centric transformation for accessing warfighting and business processes on both the NIPRNET and SIPRNET.  The MCEITS platforms consist of the EITCs and the Distributed platforms and provide the processing infrastructure within which the other program elements operate.  The Distributed platforms support designated Marine Corps Installation (MCI) Commanders, Marine Forces (MARFOR) Commanders and MEF Commanders.  The Tactical Collaboration Work Suite (TCWS), identified in the MCEITS CDD as the gap-filler for the MCEITS expeditionary capability, will be hosted on the Combat Operations Center hardware with MCEITS providing capability/software as a service IAW MCCDC letter of clarification dated 5 December 2008.
  Subsequent MCEITS expeditionary capabilities will be further specified by MCCDC in the follow-on releases supporting land and amphibious missions.

The operations and maintenance of the MCEITS capability was previously identified in the CDD as being a part of the MOC.  The MOC functionality will be delivered and integrated into the MCNOSC.   NetOps enables C2 of the Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN), which incorporates MCEITS capabilities. The MOC functions support the needs and direction of the Marine Corps warfighting and business mission areas, in accordance with Marine Corps Chief Information Officer (CIO) direction utilizing IT Service Management (ITSM) and Enterprise Service Management (ESM) processes, tools and capabilities.
 

The Capability Production Document (CPD) identifies at a high level the Initial and Full Operational Capability (IOC / FOC) requirements for MCEITS.  IOC, scheduled for Q2FY11, shall be declared when one operational EITC with data and application environments is established with High Availability and Continuity (HA/C) to support ten percent capacity, a functional SIE is established, and an initial Operations management capability is established within the MCNOSC with a plan for establishing and staffing the full capability to satisfy all DOTMLPF requirements.  MCEITS Full Operational Capability (FOC) is scheduled for FY12 and beyond.  When FOC is realized, MCEITS will deliver the Enterprise platforms with the hardware, software, and facilities infrastructure required to support MCEITS-hosted, non-managed hosted or provisioned applications and services necessary to enable the collaboration and access to trusted information.
 MCEITS provides the infrastructure necessary to support information accessibility and collaboration, and enhances enterprise visibility to manage Marine Corps IT assets and services.

MCEITS platforms shall provide a set of key components for establishing an information infrastructure that will enable commanders/users to access information and collaborate on both the NIPRNET and SIPRNET.  These end-to-end sets of information capabilities will provide an understandable and multidimensional view of the battlespace to the future Marine and/or Joint Task Force Commander by providing capabilities that will support the full range of military operations, including high intensity conflict.  MCEITS capabilities are successively refined through Modeling and Simulation (M&S) and input from analysis conducted in the Systems Integration Environment (SIE) through a series of Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3Is).

<a href="mailto:Julina.Lee@va.gov">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is aggressively undertaking a five year plan to end homelessness among Veterans by developing new prevention initiatives and expanding existing programs to provide shelter and comprehensive supportive services for homeless Veterans.
The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to search for qualified vendors capable of meeting the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) requirements for a commercially available handheld device to assist VA staff in both capturing information about Veterans who are homeless and transmitting the data to the Homeless Operations Management and Evaluation System (HOMES) in real time when possible.  In addition, when meeting with Veterans away from VA facilities, the devices will also be used by VA personnel to communicate with each other via email, text message, and phone and also query for information via the internet about community resources available to assist their clients.  

Timely and accurate data about this subset of the Veteran population is necessary to monitor the effectiveness of these initiatives. To that end, VA developed HOMES as a repository of information about Veterans who are homeless.  The repository is populated with identity, health, and other information about Veterans for whom one of the following housing statuses apply:

o	Lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence 
o	Reside in a public or privately operated shelter or institution
o	Reside in a place not designed for use as a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings

A field network of Veteran outreach personnel captures the information during face-to-face interviews at VA medical centers, community based outpatient centers, and while canvassing areas frequented by homeless persons.   Today, VA Veteran outreach workers use paper forms to record this information; however, VA seeks to inquire about market capabilities and contractor experience in the use of handheld devices. This RFI provides an opportunity for respondents to submit their ideas and experience related to this request.

The VA would like to seek information about:
1.	Commercially available handheld devices that case and social workers can utilize to assist them in their duties in assisting the homeless Veteran.
2.	Hardware and software solutions that are both secure and easy to use.
3.	Integration of the hardware and software solution into a larger Information System infrastructure.  Consider having the handheld device access HOMES and VA Systems (e.g. Vista).
4.	Capability to capture digital pictures and voice recording.  Ability of transmitting such pictures and voice recording to a server.
5.	Examples of current installations with other homeless programs which can be at the federal, state or local level.
6.	Handheld device network capability: ability to connect via a Wi-Fi network, wireless broadband, and wired broadband connection (RJ45).

The following are some of the abilities relative to the work being done by the social or case workers.  The handheld devices and technologies need to enable workers in the field to do their jobs and to provide and access data and information they need such as:

o	Veteran identification:
A worker will be able to securely submit a Veteran's identifier(s) and view a photograph of that Veteran, along with descriptive information, eligibility information, and any alerts or flags about that Veteran. All text should be clearly visible and easily legible.
o	Information display:
A worker should easily be able to navigate any VA system that provides information of relevance. Screen size and text size should be appropriate.
o	Data entry:
Any mobile devices should include a keyboard of a size that allows proper typing for data entry.  There should also be an alternative to a plug-in mouse that allows point and click but without a cable or anything that needs to be added to the device, to facilitate mobility.
o	Resource availability:
The worker should have easy access to information about available resources for that Veteran, such as available beds for a Veteran who has nowhere to spend the night.
o	Notes Capture:
The worker should be able to easily capture case notes, verbal and/or written.
o	Time Charging:
The worker should be able to charge their time for hours spent in the field on official duty.
o	Durability:
Any mobile device will need to be able to withstand extended use outdoors in various environments and weather conditions.
o	Safety and security:
Any mobile device will need to be able to prevent against unauthorized access of data, and should be locatable using GPS technology. Devices should be easy to update with any software patches that will be needed.
o	Back at the office:
Devices should be easily adaptable to use back at the office, and be able to connect to local LANs, WANs, printer networks, etc.
o	Ease of integration:
Devices should not require unreasonable infrastructure changes or additional software purchases, installations, implementations, or other in order for them to be used by VA.

In the event VA proceeds to a formal request for proposals, VA reserves the right to consider alternative engagement models.

This market research is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this market research will be the outcome of a competitive process.

This bridge contract vehicle is necessary to continue to meet mission critical requirements, mitigate the impact of personnel turnover, and to support transition to competitively awarded follow-on contracts. The period of performance of this bridge effort will be 1 Jan 2011 through 30 April 2011. There will be no transition period.<br />This sole-source bridge contract effort is strictly for the continuation of services in support of the operation, sustainment, and critical modification improvements of systems supporting the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), and Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) mission until the follow-on competitive source selection is complete. This sole-source effort provides continued A&amp;AS support to the Space and Missile Systems Center, Space Logistics Directorate (SMC/SL) and related space organizations using contractor personnel resources through a single vehicle to optimize efficiencies for planning, programming, sustainment and implementation cycles, development of policy, decision making, management and administration, etc. The effort also provides analysis/recommendations to research and development activities along with engineering and technical advice. The proposed effort will continue to improve the effectiveness of management processes and/or procedures and takes the form of advice, opinions, alternatives, analyses, evaluations, recommendations, training and technical support.

B.  Questions were received regarding the RFQ and the following are the Government's responses:
1.  Is there any posibility that this solicitation can be set-aside for either HUBZone firms or under the Buy Indian Act for an Indian Owned firm?  Our firm is an SBA certified HUBZone and TERO certified Indian owned contractor. 
Government Response:  At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, this will remain as a Total Small Business.
2.   I understand that travel costs can not exceed those parameters identified in the FTR, however, I do not understand the format in which quotes are being requested.  In the SOW, under "Travel Costs" are you looking for the travel costs only associated with each meeting listed, OR are you looking for the complete expense to the BIA for the vendor to facilitate each meeting which would include both travel expenses and salary for example. 
Government Response:  Another line was added to include the facilitation services cost per each meeting. Therefore, both travel and facilitation services costs should be listed separate per meetings held. 3.  Under "Deliverables" is a price per item in addition to the meeting costs be provided, OR is the expense of these deliverables supposed to be accounted for in the "Travel Costs" portion of the solicitation?   
Government Response: Changes was made to include another line for facilitation services per meeting. Includedeliverables in the Facility Services Cost Line Item.
4.  What is the unit of measure desired for the quote; should it be hourly, per deliverable, per line item in the SOW, or lump sum to complete the entire natural resources meeting facilitation process b/t the tribe and BIA?
Government Response:  There were changes done per line item to include facility services costs.  A detailed breakdown of travel and the facility costs must be included with quote.


C. No more questions will be accepted.
D.  The response date does not change.  It is still December 6, 2010.
E.  All other terms and conditions remain the same.

<DESC>This is a NOTICE OF INTENT to solicit and award a contract to Leadership Development Associates (LDA) of Orange, California on a sole source basis.  Under two previous contracts with IRS, awarded as the result of competitive solicitations, LDA provided Executive Readiness training to IRS executives. Included in this training was a course entitled Leading as a way of Serving, a video based course which was customized for IRS executives. Executives of the IRS's Wage and Investment Division have determined that this training should be available to all its leaders. The new contract will be awarded to LDA as a follow on to the previous contract.  The proposed training program will be developed by revising LDAs Leading From the Heart(c) curriculum to create a Leading as a Way of Serving curriculum for all-levels of the Wage & Investment leadership team. In addition to further customization of the curriculum, LDA will also train personnel as facilitators for the revised course. The fact that the course will be developed from training already provided by LDA makes them the logical Vendor for the follow on contract.

<DESC>The Fort Worth District Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements, (PLAs), for large scale construction contracts, (Exceeding $25 Million), within the Fort Worth District Design/Construction boundaries. Some of the factors that maybe considered regarding their use are:<BR>a.)	The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades.<BR>b.)	The complexity of the project.<BR>c.)	Shortage of skilled labor in the region.<BR>d.)	Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.<BR>e.)	The use of PLA's on other comparable projects.<BR>f.)	The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.<BR>g.)	The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion.<BR>h.)	Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.<BR>PLA is defined as a Pre-Hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).<BR>Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), Policy:<BR>a.)	Project Labor Agreement,(PLA), is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal Procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, Agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.<BR>b.)	An Agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree for that project to negotiate or become party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the Agency decidesthat the use of project labor agreements will:<BR>1.)	Advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, produce-labor management stability and ensure compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health. Equal opportunity, labor and employment standards and other matters and...<BR>2.)	Be consistent with law.<BR>Reference Provision: 52.222-23 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreements.<BR>In consideration of the above factors and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLA's. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:<BR>a.)	Should PLA's be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the Fort Worth District boundaries? What other factors should the Corps of Engineers consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Fort Worth District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for the utilization of a PLA?<BR>b.)	Is the use of PLA's effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government if using PLA's? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?<BR>c.)	Is the use of PLA's effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?<BR>d.)	Is the use of PLA's conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLA's used for those specific contracts?<BR>e.)	Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing working in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both prime contractor and at least one subcontractor or two or more subcontractors employing the same trade? <BR>f.)	Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.<BR>g.)	Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance period. Will a PLA impact completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<BR>h.)	Where have PLA's been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, Municipal or private entities in the geographic area of this District?<BR>i.)	Will the use of PLA's impact the ability of potential offerors and/or subcontractors to meet the Small Business utilization goals?<BR>Please provide your comments via email to: david.m.deleranko@usace.army.mil no later than 14 December 2010.<BR>Contracting Office Address:<BR>U.S. Army Engineer District Fort Worth <BR>ATTN: CESWF-CT-C (Rm 2A19)<BR>819 Taylor Street<BR>Fort Worth, Texas  76102-0300<BR><BR>Place of Performance:<BR>USACE Fort Worth District<BR>P.O.

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Winthrop National Fish Hatchery Stockton Fish and and Leavenworth NFH, 453A Twin Lakes Road, Winthrop, WA 98862, has a requirement  to replace 19 fiberglass tanks in the hatchery buildings by March 19 for fish rearing. These tanks must be sufficiently reinforced to hold water while not changing shape (expanding/contracting) when filled or drained.  The new tanks need a similar design to the ones currently in the hatchery building.  Additionally they need to fit into the space voided by the former tanks.  The construction material should be smooth, non-porous, low maintenance and not require interior or exterior painting.   Past performance using tanks constructed of plastic / fiberglass have met expectations for durability, rearing healthy fish, and ease of maintenance.  A forest green color is preferred.  The specifications for the tanks are attached and described in more detail in the section entitled "Scope."Selection process is "best value" based on Past Performance, Experience and Price.  Submit all information to the USFWS/CGS, Attn:  GT, 911 NE 11th Avenue, Portland, OR 97232.  on or before 12/29/2010 by COB PST.

<p><br />Background</p>
<p>The Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is located in Bethesda, Maryland. The NIH Clinical Center provides patient care and research support for over 1300 active clinical research protocols of the intramural program. These clinical protocols represent a wide variety of research questions posed by investigators from each of the institutes and centers comprising the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>In August of 2004, the Clinical Center implemented a new hospital information system for orders, results and documentation. Entitled the Clinical Research Information System (CRIS); this large enterprise system supports all patient care activities within the NIH Clinical Center. Ancillary systems supporting radiology, surgery, lab, nutrition and admissions provide a suite of tools to provide electronic support for all aspects of patient care. All data through the CRIS system is organized by patient. Each patient is assigned to one or more protocols and all data collected is assigned to a specific protocol.</p>
<p>The current CRIS system provides information on a patient basis. The Biomedical Translational Research Information System or BTRIS is an NIH enterprise project and is designed to provide researchers access to all patient data from CRIS as well as other NIH intramural systems. This allows researchers access to data across one protocol, or multiple protocols. Access to larger data sets is possible allowing for data mining and hypothesis generation. Ultimately, BTRIS will enable the NIH intramural program to share data with outside organizations such as FDA, CTSA partners and other extramural collaborators.</p>
<p>BTRIS received a full security clearance and authority to operate on 7/30/2010. Therefore, BTRIS is a mixed lifecycle system requiring attention to ongoing security concerns based on NIH requirements as well as new security issues related to development activities. As an NIH enterprise system containing personally identifiable information, BTRIS must continue to meet all security requirements as stipulated by the Privacy Act as well a meet regulatory rules for clinical research.

To be technically acceptable provide technically qualified technicians available for performing services (i.e. resumes, certificates and/or any other documentation). Only those quotes considered technically acceptable will be further evaluated for price.  <BR>FACTOR 2 - PRICE  <BR><BR>Evaluation Process: All quotes will be evaluated based on their technical acceptability.  The award decision will be based on the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote. To be considered technically acceptable, the offeror shall submit a quote on services requested.  Award will be on an all or none basis; the offeror shall submit prices on all CLINs.  <BR><BR> (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <BR>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (End of provision 52.212-2).<BR><BR>52.212-2 Addendum, includes the following to paragraph (a):     The Government will evaluate each quote strictly in accordance with its contents.  A quote that is unrealistic in terms of technical quality or price will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the contractual requirements.  Such quotes may be determined unacceptable.  Award will be made to the lowest-price, technically-acceptable offeror.  Award will be made to the offeror that presents the quote that possesses all of the following characteristics:  <BR>(1) meets the acceptability standards,<BR>(2) conforms to the solicitation,<BR>(3) determined acceptable to the Government,<BR>(4) is from a responsible (as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 9) offeror,<BR>and (5) has the lowest price of those offerors meeting the first four characteristics listed here.  <BR><BR>Except for communications conducted for the purpose of minor clarification, the Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions.  Therefore, each initial offer shall contain the offeror's best terms from a technical and price standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if it is later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  <BR><BR>TECHNICAL EVALUATION STANDARDS:<BR><BR>(1) Acceptable - A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with minimal detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a minimal understanding of the problems, with an overall moderate to high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.  <BR><BR>(2)  Unacceptable - A proposal that contains a major error(s), omission(s) or deficiency(ies) that indicates a lack of understanding of the problems or an approach that cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk  and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal. (End of 52.212-2 Addendum); <BR><BR>52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items Alt I.  (Offerors must complete FAR 52.212-3 Offerors Representations and Certifications - Commercial items or do so on-line at http://orca.bpn.gov). <BR><BR>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D.

The price shall be evaluated to determine fairness and reasonableness.<br />****Technical capability and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.

The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)<br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).<br />(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the "hourly rate" for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the "hourly rate" attributable to profit shall be 10 percent.

Insert "$0" if no fixed price reimbursement for indirect costs will be provided. (If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert "Each order must list separately the fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule or, if no reimbursement for indirect costs, insert &lsquo;None'."]<br />(2) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract.<br />(3) Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and until the Contracting Officer notifies the contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price.<br />(4) Access to records. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer (or authorized representative) will have access to the following (access shall be limited to the listing below unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer):<br />(i) Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice met the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract.<br />(ii) For labor hours (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule), when timecards are required as substantiation for payment-<br />(A) The original timecards (paper-based or electronic);<br />(B) The Contractor's timekeeping procedures;<br />(C) Contractor records that show the distribution of labor between jobs or contracts; and<br />(D) Employees whose time has been included in any invoice for the purpose of verifying that these employees have worked the hours shown on the invoices.<br />(iii) For material and subcontract costs that are reimbursed on the basis of actual cost-<br />(A) Any invoices or subcontract agreements substantiating material costs; and<br />(B) Any documents supporting payment of those invoices.<br />(5) Overpayments/Underpayments. Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding invoices, that are found by the Contracting Officer not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to increase for underpayments. The Contractor shall promptly pay any such reduction within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The Government within 30 days will pay any such increases, unless the parties agree otherwise. The Contractor's payment will be made by check. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on an invoice payment, the Contractor shall-<br />(i) Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the-<br />(A) Circumstances of the overpayment (e.g., duplicate payment, erroneous payment, liquidation errors, date(s) of overpayment);<br />(B) Affected contract number and delivery order number, if applicable;<br />(C) Affected contract line item or subline item, if applicable; and<br />(D) Contractor point of contact.<br />(ii) Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to the Contracting Officer.<br />(6) <br />(i) All amounts that become payable by the Contractor to the Government under this contract shall bear simple interest from the date due until paid unless paid within 30 days of becoming due. The interest rate shall be the interest rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury, as provided in section 611 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-563), which is applicable to the period in which the amount becomes due, and then at the rate applicable for each six month period as established by the Secretary until the amount is paid.<br />(ii) The Government may issue a demand for payment to the Contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract.<br />(iii) Final Decisions. The Contracting Officer will issue a final decision as required by 33.211 if-<br />(A) The Contracting Officer and the Contractor are unable to reach agreement on the existence or amount of a debt in a timely manner;<br />(B) The Contractor fails to liquidate a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer within the timeline specified in the demand for payment unless the amounts were not repaid because the Contractor has requested an installment payment agreement; or<br />(C) The Contractor requests a deferment of collection on a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer (see FAR 32.60702).<br />(iv) If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the same due date as the original demand for payment.<br />(v) Amounts shall be due at the earliest of the following dates:<br />(A) The date fixed under this contract.<br />(B) The date of the first written demand for payment, including any demand for payment resulting from a default termination.<br />(vi) The interest charge shall be computed for the actual number of calendar days involved beginning on the due date and ending on-<br />(A) The date on which the designated office receives payment from the Contractor;<br />(B) The date of issuance of a Government check to the Contractor from which an amount otherwise payable has been withheld as a credit against the contract debt; or<br />(C) The date on which an amount withheld and applied to the contract debt would otherwise have become payable to the Contractor.<br />(vii) The interest charge made under this clause may be reduced under the procedures prescribed in 32.608-2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation in effect on the date of this contract.<br />(viii) Upon receipt and approval of the invoice designated by the Contractor as the "completion invoice" and supporting documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract, any outstanding balances will be paid within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The completion invoice, and supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion.<br />(7) Release of claims. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions.<br />(i) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible to exact statement by the Contractor.<br />(ii) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier.<br />(iii) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents.<br />(8) Prompt payment.

In connection with any discount offered for early payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made.<br />(l) Termination for the Government's convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records.

The nature of the conflict of interest and the limitation on future contracting ["contracting officer shall insert description here"] .<br />(b) If any such conflict of interest is found to exist, the Contracting Officer may (1) disqualify the offeror, or (2) determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the United States to contract with the offeror and include the appropriate provisions to avoid, neutralize, mitigate, or waive such conflict in the contract awarded. After discussion with the offeror, the Contracting Officer may determine that the actual conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, mitigated or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the Government, and the offeror may be found ineligible for award.<br />(c) Disclosure: The offeror hereby represents, to the best of its knowledge that:<br />___ (1) It is not aware of any facts which create any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest relating to the award of this contract, or<br />___ (2) It has included information in its proposal, providing all current information bearing on the existence of any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest, and has included a mitigation plan in accordance with paragraph (d) of this provision.<br />(d) Mitigation. If an offeror with a potential or actual conflict of interest or unfair competitive advantage believes the conflict can be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the offeror shall submit a mitigation plan to the Government for review.

If a mitigation plan is approved, the restrictions of this provision do not apply to the extent defined in the mitigation plan.<br />(e) Other Relevant Information: In addition to the mitigation plan, the Contracting Officer may require further relevant information from the offeror. The Contracting Officer will use all information submitted by the offeror, and any other relevant information known to DHS, to determine whether an award to the offeror may take place, and whether the mitigation plan adequately neutralizes or mitigates the conflict.<br />(f) Corporation Change. The successful offeror shall inform the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of the effective date of any corporate mergers, acquisitions, and/or dive stures that may affect this provision.<br />(g) Flow-down. The contractor shall insert the substance of this clause in each first tier subcontract that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold.<br />(End of provision)<br />CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY</p>
<p>No oral or written statement of any person other than the Contracting Officer will in any manner or degree modify or otherwise affect the terms of this contract. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements under this contract, and notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, said authority remains solely with the Contracting Officer. In the event the Contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in cost incurred as a result thereof.</p>
<p>CONTRACT DEFICIENCY REPORT</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer Representative (COR) may issue a Contract Deficiency Report, Form SFLC, 005-1. The Contractor shall respond in writing within 24 hours of receipt, unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer, to the COR. The COR will comment on the contractor's response and will forward the Deficiency Report and comments to the Contracting Officer, with a copy to the contractor, SFLC, the NESU and Program Manager. The Contracting Officer will make the final response to the contractor in writing.</p>

To further this policy, the Commandant has created the position of Solicitation Ombudsman who is empowered to investigate issues raised by prospective offerors and resolve them, where possible, without expensive and time-consuming litigation.</p>
<p>Potential quoters who believe that a Coast Guard solicitation is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the quoter should then contact the Coast Guard Solicitation Ombudsman at the address below:</p>
<p>Commandant (G-CPM-S/3)<br />2100 Second Street, SW<br />Washington, D.C. 20593<br />Telephone (202)267-2285<br />FAX: (202)267-4011</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester&rsquo;s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency&rsquo;s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 Washington, D.

<DESC><p>The purpose of Amendment 1 to DARPA-BAA-11-06 Advanced Wireless Networks for the Soldier (AWNS) is to correct the proposal due "time" and  provide answers to the questions received to date.<br /> A. Page 4, change the "time" only for the proposal submission from 12:00 am local time, to 12:00 pm, local time. The proposal due date remains 20 December 2010.<br />B.  Page 25, Section 4.5.1, first sentence, change the "time" only for the proposal submission from on or before 12:00 a.m. to on or before 12:00 p.m. The proposal due date remains 20 December 2010.<br />C.  The following solicitation questions and answers are provided:<br />Q1.  The BAA states all proposals are due 12 am December 20th, given this is a Sunday at midnight is that the correct time expected?<br />A1.  The proposals are due by "Noon", 12 PM, on 20 December 2010.<br />Q2.  Is it possible to propose a small team of 3-4 PIs?  Is it allowable to have a focused bid on a specific use of WNaN radios, and our team will have expertise in databases, wireless, and sensor networking?<br />A2.  There are no requirements about performer's organization or the size of the team.<br />Q3.  For universities-only bid, will there be a publication review process? I.e. all publications have to be subjected to a review period.<br />A3.  Yes, as stated in section 6.5 of the BAA, publication review is a requirement of any resulting contract.<br />Q4.  Are there any security clearance or nationality requirements for this project?<br />A4.  Per BAA Para 4.2, "Classified Proposals are not expected in response to this BAA. However, should a proposer choose to submit classified material, proposers may submit unclassified proposals, unclassified with a classified appendix, or entirely classified proposals.  ...  Proposers must have existing and in-place prior to execution of an award, approved capabilities (personnel and facilities) to perform research and development at the classification level they propose."     Per BAA Para 3.1, foreign participants and/or individuals may participate to the extent that such participants comply with any necessary Non-Disclosure Agreements, Security Regulations, Export Control Laws, and other governing statutes applicable under the circumstances.<br />Q5.  What is the processing power on the WNaN Radio today?<br />A5.  The WNaN radio today has two Texas Instruments Open Multimedia Applications Platform (OMAP) processors that are clocked at 800 MHZ.  At least one processor is available for sharing. The radio function will have priority over any other tasks. Proposers should assume that an average of 50% of this processor will be available to multitask.  In addition, 256MB RAM memory is available for multitasking.  Proposers may assume that an average of 50% of this RAM memory is available for application multitasking.  Proposers may also assume that at least 1 GB of flash memory is available to application multi-tasking.  Proposers should also assume that the standardized APIs will inform them exactly how much resource is available on each radio. <br />Q6.  Is there any plan to upgrade its processing power in the future?  If so when will this become available to AWNS and how much would it be?  If possible please provide the amount of resources available for third party technology developers.<br />A6.  Proposers should not expect or plan on additional processing resources in the WNaN radios available for wireless distributive computing (WDC) development.  However, proposers are welcome to demonstrate thresholds of processor and memory performance which may enable dramatic differences in application performance or capability that would justify non-recurring and recurring cost impacts of additional performance. Accompanying this recommendation, please also indicate the consequent proposed impact to battery life.<br />Q7.  On the current WNaN radio, how many RF chains can be ganged together at the same time for MIMO applications? If the number is less than 4, then is there a plan to increase this to a maximum of 4? If so when will this be made available to AWNS? <br />A7.  Currently, proposers should assume that 2 channels may be ganged together for MIMO. Proposers wishing to gang more than 2 channels together for MIMO should explain the additional merits to the physical, MAC and network layer performance of the adhoc network as additional channels are ganged together.<br />Q8.  Can the current WNaN radio support 4 simultaneous links each at a different frequency?   If not will this be a feature to be added in the future and made available to AWNs? If so when? <br />A8.  Proposers should define what radio functionality (addressing the multiple layers of a traditional radio protocol stack) needs to be able to be done simultaneously by 1, 2, 3 or 4 channels to support the features of their proposed technical concepts, and whether the channels are ganged together, fully independent, or some hybrid.<br />Q9.  Are applications other than soldier radios sought with this BAA?<br />A9.  At this time, DARPA is not seeking to demonstrate WNaN applications other than utilization in defense applications.<br />Q10.  Are there detailed physical layer/higher layer descriptions (specifications), as well as RF specifications that exist that are obtainable for the WNaN ? <br />A10.  As it says in the BAA, vendors may request the performance metrics document by submitting the request form to the DARPA-BAA-11-06 email address. The metrics document is available to contractors upon request. Winning performers will receive additional information about the standardized application programming interface (API) between the radio physical layer and the networking software. By matching the API interfaces, alternative networking software or alternative radio hardware can be introduced.<br />Q11.  What specific aspects of the Wireless Network after Next (WNaN) would be needed to be retained in the AWNS program?<br />A11.  Minimum performance indicated in the performance metrics documents need to be retained if hardware, software, or networking functionality is modified, or enhanced.<br />Q12. Wireless Distributive Computing (WDC) is one of two major services described in Area 4 (Section 1.2.4), but "Wireless distributed computing (cloud) middleware)" is also mentioned as a Transformative Apps service to be proposed in Area 3.  Is it ok to bid a solution to WDC that is independent of the Transformative Apps WDC service when responding to Area 4?  <br />A12. Proposers may propose to either or both solutions.  Any alternative should include an API that the proposer plans to bring forward as an industry standard.<br />Q13. Should Area 4 proposals cover allocation of all resources: processing, storage, AND network links, or is network management (link allocation) covered in other areas? (It's understood that allocations need to honor constraints of power, bandwidth, etc.) <br />A13. If a proposer chooses to utilize an alternative solution, then his API should address and he will be responsible to manage all processing, link and network resources.<br />Q14. When responding to Area 4, is there value in also proposing an application that exploits and highlights the benefits to the warfighters of the WDC and CBA services, or should we assume that existing applications will be used to demonstrate the Area 4 capabilities?<br />A14. Yes, paragraph 1.2.4 of the BAA states, "DARPA is seeking innovative technology proposals demonstrating important capabilities and applications that can be enabled by utilizing remaining computational resources available with a squad of nine (9) or more WnaN radios.</p>

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Digestive, Diabetes &amp; Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) intends to procure the following items: Brand Name or Equal to: NIMBUS Independent Channel base platform (3X4) with the following specifications: 1 - (62797-01): NIMBUS Independent Channel base platform (3X4)4 - (NIMBUS-1ml): 1ml channel 1 - (56585-01): PC controller (preloaded w/software)2 - (56212-01): Nimbus MTP Standoff Module2 - (57537-01): Nimbus Tip Rack Standoff Module1 - (61052-01): Assay Pedestal 50 uL Reagent Container1 - (235966): Conductive 50 uL Tips in Frames (Case of 5, 760)1 - (235902): Conductive 300 uL Tips in Frames (Case of 5, 760)1 - (56694-01): Reagent Tubs with Lids, Case of 20 50mL, Self-Standing The NIMBUS allows for four independent pipetting channels. Since our applications involve mixing variable amounts of up to four stock solutions in each well, programming the NIMBUS to accomplish this task will be simplified, and plate preparation will be accelerated by a factor of 2 to 4 relative to comparable platforms. The NIMBUS employs a pressure transducer to detect and control actual flow and delivery of pipetted samples, in order to ensure accurate and precise delivery of liquids having very different viscosities at volumes as small as 1 &mu;l Unlike comparable platforms, the NIMBUS can detect an absence of sufficient liquid in a source vial to completely aspirate and/or deliver the designated volume, and depending upon the program, either alert the user or take appropriate corrective measures. The NIMBUS utilizes an air displacement pipetting system rather than a liquid-filled one. The liquid-filled systems are not amenable to feedback sensing and moreover require routine maintenance - detergent flush - to ensure the absence of contamination. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations however; all responses received within 10 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516 the business size standard is 500. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. All responsible businesses that are capable of providing the Government with the items listed above may download a copy of the Request for Quote (RFQ). The solicitation will be issued on or about December 2, 2010. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors will be used Equally to evaluate offers: Technical Evaluation, Price, and Past Performance. Note: Past Performance Information: Vendors must submit a listing of the most recent contracts/awards (minimum of 3) which demonstrate similar work in nature to this Solicitation.

<p>SF 330 PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>Total Government Requirement</p>
<p>(a) The GLNPO's estimated Sediment Remediation Design (SDR) requirements, if split evenly between the two contracts, would result in two equal contracts reaching the requirement limits exactly.

<p>&bull; Contractors ineligibility to perform work (e.g., due to conflicts of interest)<br />&bull; Contractors inferior past performance</p>
<p>(c) Though EPA does not specifically anticipate such needs, it reserves the right to issue task orders under these contracts in excess of 2 of the requirement. In no event will the value of the total Task Orders issued under either of the contracts exceed the maximum contract value.</p>
<p>General Proposal Instructions</p>

<DESC>The General Services Administration is planning a procurement for Cafeteria/Concession Services at the Social Security Administration, Metro West Facility. The cafeteria will be operated for the benefit of approximately 1900<span style="COLOR: blue"> </span>employees who occupy the building located at 300 North Greene Street, Baltimore, Maryland, 21290.
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-line-height-alt: 10.2pt; tab-stops: .5in 1.0in 1.5in 2.0in 2.5in"><br />The contract shall be solicited as a 1-year base contract, with the possibility of four (4) 1-year options, for a potential contract period total of five (5) years.</p>
<p>The Government will provide the space, lighting, heating and air-conditioning, major equipment and major equipment repairs.</p>
<p>This will be a no-cost contract. Cafeteria/Concession Services are procured on a profit and loss (P &amp; L) type basis. In addition, the operator is limited to a 10% profit and administrative expense. A wage determination from the Department of Labor will specify minimum wages to be paid to cafeteria employees.</p>
<p>The selected contractor shall be responsible for remitting a 1-1/2% fee of gross sales to the government. On average, the current operator reports $540,000 in annual sales.</p>
<p>NAICS Code: The applicable NAICS code is 722310, Food Service Contractors, and the small business size standard is $20.5 million.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>This procurement will be issued as Full and Open Competition. FAR 19 is not applicable to food service contracts. Food services are a non-appropriated activity. This is based on a prior opinion by Office of General Counsel that the set-aside requirement is not applicable because concession contracts do not involve the expenditure of appropriated funds. It is also based on Controller General decision B-253161, August 19, 1993.</p>
<p>A pre-proposal conference will be held on December 15, 2010 at 10:30 AM. EST.&nbsp; <br /><br />Contractors are required to email Ms. Breean Daley at breean.daley@gsa.gov, with the names of the persons who will be attending the conference no later than December 10, 2010. Notification before the scheduled meeting is mandatory.<br /><br />Contractor shall submit the following information prior to the Pre-Proposal Conference:<br />1.) Names of all individuals attending<br />2.) Company name of all individuals<br />3.) Model/Make of all cars<br />4.) License plate number of all cars</p>
<p><strong>The proposals are due&nbsp;on January 5, 2011 no later then 12:00 PM. EST.&nbsp; </strong><strong>The proposal due date is firm and will not be </strong><strong>extended under any circumstances.</strong></p>

<p>The U. S.

The Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime. All services, supplies, utilities and tenant alterations are to be provided as a part of the rental considerations.

The acquisition and resulting multiple award contracts will be collectively referred to as TABSS (Technical, Acquisition and Business Support Services). The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is conducting this department-wide acquisition with on behalf of DHS and all of its components. Use of this contract vehicle will be limited to all DHS components.</p>
<p>The technical, acquisition and business support services to be acquired can be categorized into three domains: (1) Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services, (2) Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services and (3) Contract Management Support Services. These domains comprise the professional services necessary to support a wide-range of Departmental requirements, to include DHS component organizations as well as those more specific in meeting the programmatic needs of the United States Coast Guard Acquisition Directorate (CG-9).</p>
<p>The objectives for this acquisition include:<br />a) Providing a comprehensive range of support services for use throughout the DHS.<br />b) Providing a continuous alignment between business strategy, business processes, and various management support services while simultaneously maintaining an acquisition approach based on flexibility and efficiency.<br />c) Leveraging the DHS spend in acquiring essential support services in an effective, economical, and expedient manner consistent with the DHS mission through the use of this enterprise-wide contract.<br />d) Promote and support DHS socio-economic goals and initiatives.</p>
<p>This acquisition is intended to replace numerous disparate contracts at USCG, as well as 3 multiple-award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) awarded by the DHS Strategic Sourcing Program Office. Said multiple-award BPAs consist of those for Acquisition Support Services, Financial Management Support Services and Program Management Support Services, which are scheduled to expire between May and June 2011. TABSS will also serve in companion to the Program Management, Administrative, Clerical and Technical Services (PACTS) contract. Although PACTS may appear to provide similar services as the TABSS Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services domain, the PACTS services are more generalized in nature. Under the TABSS vehicle, program management services are intended to meet a full range of specialized Program, Business, and Acquisition support services across multiple domains ensuring business continuity and integration. In the case of requirements overlap for a specific task order, PACTS will remain DHS' preferred vehicle.</p>
<p>This acquisition will utilize both unrestricted and small business set-aside award tracks.
