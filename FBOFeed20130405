<DESC>Market Survey/Request for Information on
Enhanced Terminal Voice Switch (ETVS) and Small Tower Voice Switch (STVS) Logistics Support

GENERAL INFORMATION:

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), is conducting a Market Survey/Request for Information to improve the Governments understanding of the current marketplace and to identify qualified and capable sources.  This announcement is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) of any kind.  At this time, Northrup Grumman, Denro, Inc, is the only known responsible source that can provide overhaul repair or unit exchange services for the ETVS and STVS, and is the only known responsible source for the acquisition of ETVS and STVS Line Replaceable Units.
Interested sources must respond with information to confirm evidence of their qualifications and capabilities to meet requirements to repair and replenish the ETVS and STVS systems.  The FAA intends to review all response submittals to establish the acquisition strategy.  The acquisition strategy for this procurement has not been determined.  Responses to this market survey will be used to develop the Source List to be used when the solicitation for this requirement is issued, and will be used to determine if there is adequate competition to set the requirement aside for Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDB), or Small Business; or open it up for full and open competition; or justification of single source.  Any interested sources need to respond to this market survey.  The information identified from this market survey may result in a restricted Screening Process when the RFP is issued.  All decisions will be made based on the information provided by vendors responding to this market survey.  This survey is being conducted in accordance with FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.2.1.  This survey will support market research obtained from multiple sources and will be utilized for planning purposes only.

BACKGROUND

ETVS and STVS are critical subsystems for Air Traffic Control communications infrastructures.  They provide US Government Air Traffic Control personnel with access to telephone lines, air-ground radios and intercommunications.  The ETVS and STVS equipment was procured by the FAA NAS Voice Switching and Recording program office and delivered to US Government field facilities.  

The ETVS and STVS equipment must adhere to the configuration baselines as defined in the FAA National Airspace System and Department of Defense documentation.  This contract is needed as a follow on to the existing AMQ-200 administered ETVS contractor repair service contracts, DTFAAC-11-D-00073 for ETVS, and DTFAAC-09-D-00079 for STVS to ensure continued supply support to the field.  Northrop Grumman was the original ETVS and STVS equipment manufacturer, and continues to retain all documentation, processes, and procedures necessary to safely accomplish the repair of the ETVS and STVS equipment.  Therefore, the FAA does not have any specifications or drawings available for release.   

The intent of this announcement is to permit companies that may possess the technical capabilities to repair/overhaul the ETVS and STVS systems an opportunity to provide specific information as to their unique capabilities as specified in this announcement. The Contractor will need to show capability to furnish all required labor, plant, materials, fixtures, equipment, tools, test equipment, technical data/expertise and all other facilities necessary to provide services for spare part acquisition, repair/overhaul, restoration, modification, and/or unit exchange of the Government-owned items.

NOTE:  THE FAA DOES NOT HAVE ANY SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION TO PROVIDE SOURCES THAT MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN BECOMING A SOURCE OF REPAIR FOR ETVS AND STVS.

All interested vendors are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry in response to this Market Survey/Request for Information.  Therefore, any costs associated with vendors Market Survey/Request for Information submissions will be solely at the interested vendors expense.

All FAA documents are to be downloaded and printed from the FAA Contracting Opportunities Home Page found at http://faaco.faa.gov (or by access through http://fast.faa.gov).

All FAA SIR amendments will also be shown on this site as Amendment when required.  Vendors must access this site daily to determine if additional SIR amendments have been issued.  Only vendors that respond with information packages providing the required information demonstrating that their firm meets the minimum requirements will be added to the Source List.  The minimum requirements will remain the same for the issued SIR as contained in the requested information for this market survey.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure on a sole source basis with B&amp;W Tek, Inc; 19 Shea Way, Suite 301 Newark, DE 19713 for a Turnkey diode laser system.
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.  This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System code is 811219 and the business size standard is $19 million.</p>
<p>It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this contract.</p>
<p>NCI conducts research in designing, developing and testing new novel targeted imaging agents for the detection and characterization of cancer.  These imaging agents include tissue-specific MRI, PET, radionuclide, and optical probes.  NCI is focused on the clinical translation of targeted imaging agents for cancer imaging.</p>
<p>For the continuity and not to impede on NCI's current research, a second laser is needed from the same manufacturer.  This diode laser system is to be used in a clinical trial with partnering institutions.  NCI has established collaboration with Johns Hopkins University to conduct the first human trial of photoimmunotherapy (PIT) in patients with Head and Neck cancers.  The light, however, must be of a particular wavelength and sufficient energy.  The only manufacturer that makes diode lasers that emits light at the appropriate wavelength (690nm) is B&amp;W Tek, Inc.   This device has only recently become available is the only unit that meets the needs of this clinical trial.  This diode laser will provide specific wavelength light (690nm) that will be used with surgical instruments to kill Head and Neck tumors in selected patients whose cancers have recurred after standard therapy.  Thus, this diode laser is pivotal to the ongoing translation of PIT into clinical use.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisitions on or before 11:00 AM EST on April 23, 2013. No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax), an original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions at the address stated above.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Erin Breedlove, Contract Specialist at breeerin@nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference solicitation number NCI-130051-EB on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC><strong>Contracting Office Address<br /></strong>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Dr, RM 1E144, Rockville, MD 20852-9700.<br /><br /><strong>Description</strong><br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Radiation Biology Branch (RBB), plans to procure on a sole source basis services from Nordion, Cobalt Operations; 447 March Rd; Ottawa, Ontario Canada K2K 1X8, to dispose of a government-owned GC-220 Cobalt-60 Irradiator.
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13.106 (b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System code is 562211 the business size standard is $12.5 million.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Work shall be completed within ten (10) weeks from date of award at a time to be agreed upon by the NCI RBB.</p>
<p>It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this contract. <br /><br />The Radiation Biology Branch is decommissioning a GammaCell (GC)-220 cobalt irradiator (s/n 169). The irradiator contains highly radioactive cobalt-60 and hence the disposal of the irradiator and its radioactive sources must be done by contractors who abide by strict radiation safety procedures and have been specifically trained for this procedure on these particular units. Further, the issue of security is of utmost importance given that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has identified such radiation sources as potential targets for terrorists.<br /><br />The Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL), now named Nordion, manufactured the irradiator and still holds the original license for the cobalt-60 sources. Based on how the irradiator was manufactured, removal of the cobalt-60 sources on-site is not possible. The entire irradiator must be shipped to Nordion where they can be safely removed and disposed. Nordion is the only company that can dispose of the cobalt-60 irradiator since it is the original company that holds the license of the radioactive material. Further, in order for a contractor to remove a radioactive irradiator and dispose of it, the NRC must provide security clearance for unescorted access to the irradiators. <br /><br />Nordion is the only company that qualifies to accept and safely remove and dispose of the cobalt-60 sources contained within the GC-220 (since they created the radioactive sources initially). Since Nordion is the manufacturer of the irradiator, they are uniquely qualified to safely remove the radioactive material. <br /><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisition on or before 11:00 AM EST on April 19, 2013. No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax) an original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisition to the address stated above. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (240)276-5401 or emailed to Erin Breedlove, Contract Specialist at breeerin@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) through SAM.gov. No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference solicitation number NCI-130056-EB on all correspondence.</p>

A--Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for BAA-13-G-01-MOD-01 SUBMARINE ESCAPE, RESCUE, AND DIVER SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS, AS WELL AS DIVING EQUIPMENT Research and Development

POINT OF CONTACT:  Ryan Webb, (ryan.m.webb@navy.mil) Phone: (202) 781-4056

NOTE:  This BAA replaces BAA-13-G-01-MOD-05

The Navy Experimental Diving Unit (NEDU) is soliciting pre-proposals and proposals for applied Biomedical Research and Diving Equipment Development with a focus on Submarine Escape and Rescue, Diving Safety, and Diving Effectiveness. The goals of this program are presented in more detail below.  It is the intent that this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) be open for a one year period from the date of this publication (or until 2/15/2014).
  However, specified dates are given in paragraph (2) below for submission of pre-proposals and proposals to be awarded within FY 2014.
 
(1) Primary Interests

This program's objectives are to focus on improving or developing diving equipment that can be rapidly transitioned to a fleet capability and researching the biomedical aspects of Submarine Escape, Rescue, and Diver Safety so that procedures can be developed/improved that will increase the levels of safety and effectiveness for Navy personnel.  The typical project will be two years or less although three year projects are considered.

The areas of primary interest in submarine escape and rescue are: (1) development of rapid methods of disabled submarine (DISSUB) atmosphere assessment; (2) development of novel means to manage oxygen toxicity aboard the pressurized disabled submarine; (3) development of novel means to accelerate or eliminate saturation decompression of survivors; including, but not limited to greater oxygen use and perfluorocarbon (PFC) administration; (4) assuring survival in a disabled submarine (DISSUB) for seven days by evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of present life support stores.
 Improved Guard Book guidance and procedures,  utility of medication to reduce the metabolic rate of the crew; impact of starvation, dehydration, sleep deprivation and nitrogen narcosis at 5ATA on decision making and ability to carry out Guard Book directed survival actions and escape; (5) improving understanding and guidance for thermal stress in a disabled submarine by development and evaluation of heat stress curves for time and/or conditions to escape; heat mitigation measures (body cooling) in conditions of increased temperature and elevated CO2 (2.5 - 3%); (6) improving understanding and guidance for surface interval decompression sickness (DCS) risk after saturation dropout or aborted decompression, including, but not limited to; mitigation with various periods of oxygen pre-breathing and perfluorocarbon (PFC) administration; (7) evaluating the adequacy of hypothermia protection with present available clothing in combination with SEIS suits in SEIS rafts; (8) evaluating capability to escape from depths deeper than 600 feet by updating escape procedures and equipment; identifying necessary compression rates and further escape procedure and equipment changes that are needed; including new classes of operational submarines in the analysis; (9) improving senior survivor decision tools;(10) improving care of escape and rescue casualties within the U.S.
 Navy Submarine Rescue Diving and Recompression System, including, but not limited to critical care and casualty assessment.

The areas of primary interest in diving equipment, safety and effectiveness are organized along five Lines of Operation (LOO).  These LOO describe the primary areas of limitations for a diver and are:  Breathing Gas Supply, Human Performance, Environmental Protection, Decompression, and Tools, Transportation and Training.  Areas of interest in each LOO are:

(I)	Breathing Gas Supply: (1) Development of High pressure air flask, hose and regulators, high pressure defined for this purpose as greater than 5,000psi; (2) Improved CO2 scrubbing material for both free-swimming and fixed systems; (3) development of portable, minimal power input, O2 concentrators capable of working in conjunction with existing diving air compressors; (4) Developing a diver-worn system to extract breathing gas from surrounding seawater; (5) Developing a diver-worn system that could utilize seawater as CO2 scrubbing medium; (6) Improved helium reclaim system to support mixed gas and saturation dive systems; (7) Improved O2 sensor for use in closed-circuit UBAs; (8) Improved Portable Air Monitor that can test for all contaminants listed in table 4-2 of the U.S.
 Dive Manual in real time.

(II)	Human Performance: (1) Improving understanding of mechanism of oxygen toxicity and development of mitigations; (2) Developing and/or refining noise protection exposure limits; (3) Refine the understanding and mitigation of hypercapnia in divers; (4) Improve understanding of nitrogen narcosis to include mitigations and predictions of equivalent narcotic depths; (5) Improve understanding of effects on human body from immersion, exertion, breathing resistance, and temperature in relation to working underwater; (6) Improving understanding of and developing guidance for the prevention of immersion pulmonary edema
(III)	Environmental Protection: (1) Diver worn heater and/or chiller; (2) Temperature control for submerged divers in a wet submersible; (3) Physical protection for diver in grossly contaminated water as well as decontamination equipment and procedures; (4) Improved understanding of heat loss/retention in the submerged body, in effort to optimize heating/cooling of diver; (5) Improved passive thermal protection for divers to include improved durability to support field/combat conditions
(IV)	Decompression: (1)  Development of new decompression models valid across the full spectrum of diving;  (2) Improved procedures for shallow nitrogen-oxygen saturation diving including downward excursion dive capability on helium-nitrogen-oxygen mixtures; (3) Pharmacological or other novel mitigations for elimination of retained nitrogen in a diver; (4) Improving diagnosis of decompression illness through, but not limited to utilization of algorithms; (5) Improving understanding of the mechanisms of isobaric counter diffusion as it effects the skin, inner ear, and deep body tissues.
 (6) Improved decompression profiles based on the use of alternate gas mixtures, to include but not limited to Trimix. 
(V)	Tools, Transportation and Training: (1) Electronic recording and archiving of operational dive profiles to develop an operational dive data base; (2)  Develop a Transportable Recompression Chamber System (TRCS) replacement of similar or smaller dimensional size and functionality, using advance materials (i.e. carbon fiber, or other lightweight material) to reduce overall system weight for easier transport in military and commercial aircraft; (3) Improved diver communications, both wired and through-water; (4) Ability to track divers location underwater from surface support craft; (5) Through water data communication for divers (text, navigation, biometrics); (6) Improved diver propulsion devices to include diver worn and diver as passenger; (7) Decompression dive computer with flexibility to support multiple dives and varying breathing gas mixes; (8) Heads Up Display (HUD) for divers, both free-swimming and surface-supplied.
  HUD need not be limited to life support data (text, navigation, diagrams/schematics for projects, etc); (9) Low visibility vision enhancement for diver.

(2) Instructions for Preparation of Pre-proposal and Proposals

For FY14, the deadline for submission of pre-proposals is 3:00 PM CST, 30 March 2013 for the funding cycle that begins 1 October 2013, and the deadline for submission of full technical proposals is 3:00 PM CST, 30 April 2013.  Proposals received after the due date will be considered only if funds remain available.
The format for pre-proposals and proposals may be obtained from the Program Manager, at 202-781-4056 or E-mail: ryan.m.webb@navy.mil.  The pre-proposal should be three to five pages of text and should include an estimate of overall costs (including indirect) for each year of the proposed effort.
  A curriculum vitae of the principal investigator(s) should be appended together with any supporting information, such as reprints or preprints, which will assist in the evaluation of the pre-proposal. 

Offerors submitting the most promising pre-proposals will be invited to submit a full technical and cost proposal on all or part of their pre-proposal submission.  However, any such invitation does not obligate the Government to make an award.  Offerors are also advised all awards are subject to the DCAA contract audit process.  Any offeror may submit a full technical proposal even if its pre-proposal was not identified as promising or if no pre-proposal is submitted; however any full proposal submission would be made without the benefit of feedback prior to full proposal submission.
  A completed animal use protocol with supporting documentation is required before award when animals are employed. (Ref. SECNAVINST 3900.38C)  Any proposal that involves the experimental use of human subjects must include a separate evaluation of proposed technical approaches and associated risks by the contractor's committee for protection of human subjects. Before award, required documentation includes DoD Assurance, IRB approved Consent or waiver of documentation of informed consent, IRB approved protocol, documentation that the submitter/PI completed Human Research Protections Training, and a policy statement indicating that the institution will comply with the 32 CFR 219, DoDINST 3216.02, the SECNAVINST 3900.39 series, and all applicable sections of the 21 CFR.
  Offerors must state in their pre-proposals and full proposals that it is submitted in response to this BAA.  This BAA provides no funding for pre-proposals or subsequent proposal development purposes.  All pre-proposals will be acknowledged. Proposals will not be returned after evaluation. 

(3) Criteria for Selecting Proposals, their Relative Importance, and the Method of Evaluation

Pre-proposal and full technical proposal submissions will be evaluated on (1) the overall basis of innovation and scientific merit; (2) the relevance to submarine escape, rescue, and diving; (3) the overall value and affordability of the proposal; and (4) the offeror's capabilities, strengths and weaknesses or unique combinations of these that are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives.
  The Government reserves the right to select for funding any, all, part or none of the responses received.  For efforts funded as contracts, evaluation of the socio-economic merits will include the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities.  This is to notify potential offerors that each contract that may be placed under this announcement, or solicitation to an institution of higher education must include the following clause: "As a condition for receipt of funds available to the Department of Defense (DoD) under this award, the recipient agrees that it is not an institution that has a policy of denying, and that it is not an institution that effectively prevents the Secretary of Defense from obtaining for military recruiting purposes: (A) an entry to campuses or access to students on campuses; or (B) access to directory information pertaining to students.
 If the recipient is determined, using procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement Section 558 of Public Law 103-337 (1994), to be such an institution during the period of performance of this agreement, and therefore to be in breach of this clause, the Government will cease all payments of DoD funds under this agreement and all other DoD grants and cooperative payments unilaterally for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of award.  "If your institution has been identified under the procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement Section 558, then: (1) no funds available to DoD may be provided to your institution through any contract, including any existing contract, (2) as a matter of policy, this restriction also applies to any cooperative agreement, and (3) your institution is not eligible to receive a contract or cooperative agreement in response to this solicitation."  See instructions above for pre-proposals and proposals.
  The Government's preference is to award definitive contracts under this BAA.  However, an award can be made via grant at the sole discretion of the Government. 
All responsive sources may submit proposals that will be considered by NEDU.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals or join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete and severable areas of submarine escape, rescue, and diving for exclusive competition among these entities.  This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d) (2) (i).
  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  Questions regarding this announcement should be directed to the Contract Specialist identified herein.  Technical content questions should be addressed to Ryan Webb, Deep Submergence Biomedical Development Program Manager, (202) 781-4921.  Interested parties are invited to respond to this synopsis.

order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved
by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over
the part in the intended application. The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures
listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required
to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs. The NAVSUP
WSS Commercial Item Identification Brochureis now available at: "https://www.neco.navy.mil/cib.aspx". -SEE NOTES 9, 26

This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,
as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the
same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request
for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<SUBJECT>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE
<SOLNBR>13-SS-0014
<RESPDATE>042213
<CONTACT>Frank Kennedy, Contract Specialist, Email kennedf@onr.navy.mil
<DESC>Special Notice 13-SS-0014
<p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE</p>
<p>5-Apr-13</p>
<p>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) intends to execute a contract modification to expand the current scope of work and total contract cost under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements, on or about 20 APR 2013 to Superlative Technologies, Inc. (SuprTEK) under Contract Number N00014-12-F-0341. The new total contract amount is expected to be increased by $4.6M.</p>
<p>ONR intends to issue this expansion work on a sole source basis to SuprTEK because SuprTEK is currently maintaining both the Naval Research Information System and Business Intelligence infrastructure which are both primarily Oracle based and very customized. The use of both systems simultaneously was not envisioned at the time of RFP release nor was the magnitude of changes required to modify the current BI functions to support both systems. Their knowledge of Oracle, the customization provided for ONR, and ONR business processes allows them to perform this effort at the best value to ONR without a long learning curve period to learn ONR's unique environment.</p>
<p>The intent of this contract modification is for the contractor to address and alleviate the challenge with having two systems for financial execution of funding documents, contracts, and grants (Naval Research Information System and NAVY-Enterprise Resource Management) and capturing mission critical information to provide visibility of that data so users can continue working without significant interruption. The existing data warehouse will be leveraged to integrate the data and provide the visibility needed. . The resulting data is needed to generate enterprise level, senior management reports which allow the measurement and reporting of important statistics and workload balancing. Lacking this information, workload can backlog, and execution benchmarks can be missed which will result in both lack of Science &amp; Technology research awards and potential funding reductions for poor execution.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 514512 with the size standard of $25M. This notice of intent is not a request for proposals or quotes; however, all responsible sources may submit a quotation and technical capabilities, which, if received within fifteen calendar days of publication of this notice, shall be considered by ONR.

<p class="MsoNormal">GOLD is expected to be jointly-funded by USAID and the Swedish International Development Agency (Sida). The Program will have the following objectives and cross-cutting priorities and resources:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Objective One:</strong> Improved Local Economic Development (LED) management capacity resulting in increased number of specific initiatives resulting with increase of economic activity;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Objective Two:&nbsp; </strong>Improved economic tools for economic activity, resulting in mobilization of finance through the project&rsquo;s activities and an increase in the number of specific initiatives for economic activity;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Objective Three:</strong> Functioning, sustainable, transparent, institutionalized mechanisms developed that result in engaging public and private sector actors to spur economic activity, through increase in public-private partnerships;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Objective Four:&nbsp; </strong>Strengthened capacity of the private sector, resulting in increased skill levels of employees in the private sector and an increase in the number of local supply chain networks and the economic value they generate.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As part of the RFP, USAID will provide the Statement of Objectives (SOO) with illustrative activities and expected results that the interested offerors shall address in their proposed Statement of Work (SOW). The offeror&rsquo;s SOW will become Section C of the resultant contract.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">USAID will issue a RFP around February 15, 2013.&nbsp; Please do not consider this pre-solicitation announcement as a RFP and do not submit your proposals until the formal RFP is released.&nbsp; Award of this project shall be made subject to the availability of funds.</p>

In addition, final award cannot be made until funds have been fully appropriated, allocated, and committed and internal USAID procedures have been completed.

<DESC><strong>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT<br /></strong>Electrical Infrastructure Upgrade and Minor Bldg Alterations<br />Joint Warfare and Analysis Center (JWAC) at<br />The Naval Surface Warfare Center<br />Dahlgren, VA
<p><br /><strong>Background:</strong> Joint Warfare Analysis Center (JWAC), Dahlgren, Virginia is a premier science and engineering institution tasked with solving complex challenges for our nation's warfighters. JWAC is a tenant command at the Naval Surface Warfare Center at Dahlgren, VA. Dahlgren is located approximately 30 miles East of Fredericksburg, VA.</p>
<p>JWAC has a requirement for facility related installation, upgrades, repairs, and renovations that include but not limited to interior and exterior electrical systems, lighting, HVAC systems and controls, plumbing, fire suppression repairs, fire and intrusion alarms, communications, interior and exterior renovations, landscaping, roofing, construction of new facilities, surveys, studies, and other related work. All work will be in accordance with individual task order requirements, specifications, and drawings provided with each project in the Request for Proposal. JWAC contemplates awarding an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) task order contract for one base year and four one year options in support of JWAC facilities. JWAC has three buildings, two floors high that cover approximately 180,000 sq feet. <br />Objectives:</p>
<p><strong>1. Capabilities:</strong> The contractor shall provide a capabilities statement that demonstrates 1) the ability to provide engineering drawings on major renovations/installations; 2) the capability to provide, install, and operate a new 750 KVA Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) unit; and 3) the capability to provide facility related installation, upgrades, and repairs.</p>
<p><strong>Future Requirements that most likely will be included in a Request for Proposal:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Engineering Drawings:</strong> Contractor will design and deliver as-built facility engineering drawings upon completion of the work performed. The Government will not be providing facilities in support of the as-built drawings that will be accomplished by the contractor. There may be some minor drawing alterations that will need to be done on-site prior to final delivery.</p>
<p><strong>2. Potential Objectives of the First Task Order: </strong></p>
<p>a. The objective of this first task order is to provide a redundant 750 KVA Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) unit to replace the existing 450 KVA unit located in Building 1450B zone 405 which is approaching its end of life cycle. The new 750 KVA UPS unit will be housed outside (behind Building 1450B) in a container located next to an existing 750 KVA UPS unit. The size of the UPS container will be identical to the existing one. The new UPS unit will provide power to eight separate RDC's, through disconnect switches on the inside wall of zone 405 lab: the RDCs in turn provide power to the lab equipment. A new distribution center consisting of two 800A panels will be installed along the east wall of the computer center. The container for the new 750 KVA UPS will house the same support equipment that that exists in the existing UPS container (UPS in a Box #1), i.e. HVAC, power panels, lights, receptacles and other auxiliaries.<br />Provide a steel 11' x 50' container to be installed on the existing pad where the existing UPS in a Box is located. Provide a new power feed from the electrical switchgear of building 1450B encased in conduit to the new UPS unit. Provide all steel studding, insulation, finished walls, flooring and infrastructure to support roof top condensers and cable trays inside and outside building. Provide and install Liebert 750 KVA UPS unit along with two Liebert 450 KVA PPC units, battery cabinets, batteries, breaker bypass switch rated at 1600 amps and Liebert TVSS system. Provide cabling infrastructure for battery cabinets, bypass switch, A/C, control systems and EPO control as per NEC and engineered drawings.</p>
<p>Install two Liebert 15 ton A/C systems inside new container along with condenser units on roof top to match existing units with disconnecting means as required. Provide installation service and testing of A/C systems. Provide core drilled penetrations and sealing for conduits entering and leaving the container along with rubber dampers for conduits penetrating the building as per security requirements.<br />In the container install a 225 amp 480 volt maintenance panel for AC and a 15 KVA transformer; install 15 KVA transformer and panel with breakers for container infrastructure electrical components along with one 120 volt circuit that is supplied from the server farm by the UPS.<br />From the two 450kVAs in the container, install two 800 Amp 3 pole 208 volts breakers per PPC. Install four 800 Amp feeders to four 800 Amp MB panels in server farm. Rate neutrals at 200%. Feed the four new RDC's and the four existing RDC's from new 800 amp electrical panels.</p>
<p><strong>b. Existing Conditions for the First Task Order:</strong> JWAC's computer lab loads in Zone 405 are currently fed from the existing UPS unit through two Power Distribution Units (PDU) which feed eight Remote Distribution Centers (RDCs). The existing UPS and two PDU's will need to be removed from the computer lab area and properly disposed. The conduits and wires that connect these units to the electrical room switchgear will also need to be removed and properly disposed. Additionally, the temporary wall in Zone 405 must be removed and properly disposed.</p>
<p><strong>c. Miscellaneous:</strong> The contractor will be required to provide all crane and rigging services; transport the container to the site; unload and place the container on site. Provide traffic escort as necessary.</p>
<p>Repair any damaged to floors, walls or ceilings due to the removal or the addition of equipment.</p>
<p><strong>d. Testing:</strong> Testing of equipment will be done by qualified personnel using the manufacturer's literature as guidance and performed before any circuits are energized.</p>
<p><strong>e. Training:</strong> The contractor shall provide training to Government personnel on the proper operation of the new UPS and auxiliary equipment, along with any routine maintenance operations.</p>
<p><strong>f. Outages: </strong>The preliminary work shall be performed during normal working hours between 7 am and 4 pm Monday thru Friday. The outage will be scheduled a minimum of 30 days in advance of the timeframe needed to switch the feeders; the outage will be performed after normal working hours (0800-1600) or on weekends.</p>
<p><strong>g. Warranty:</strong> The contractor shall provide a one year equipment and workmanship warranty is included from the date of substantial completion.</p>

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.<br />The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources: (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantage businesses and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code (621511, size standard $13.0) should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>2. Notice Information</p>
<p>a. Background:<br />Investigators in the Hematology Branch study the clinical features and laboratory pathophysiology of a wide variety of bone marrow failure states, hematological malignancies, and single or multi-lineage cytopenias. There are many active IRB-approved Hematology Branch research protocols for these types of subjects which require diagnostic testing. Many of these patients participate in Protocol # 97-H-0041 or Project #94-H-0010, but numerous other protocols require specialized diagnostic testing. Some of the diagnostic testing for these protocols includes chromosomal analysis/Cytogenetics techniques such as karyotyping and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) which have been used to study chromosomal abnormalities. Routine laboratory assessments may include bone marrow aspiration and biopsy for morphology, and when indicated, additional Cytogenetics, in vitro colony growth, flow cytometry, and RNA or DNA analysis. Sometimes we request different tests for the same sample limiting our choices of vendors. A summarized list of tests is included at the bottom of this document.<br />b. Purpose and Objectives:<br />Many of the active IRB-approved Hematology Branch research protocols require chromosomal analysis/Cytogenetics techniques such as karyotyping and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) which have been used to study chromosomal abnormalities. Routine laboratory assessments may include bone marrow aspiration and biopsy for morphology, and when indicated, additional Cytogenetics, in vitro colony growth, flow cytometry, and RNA or DNA analysis. This data obtained from these test will aid in the subsequent treatment of the patient as detailed in the protocol.<br />c. Project Requirements: <br />1.) The Branch needs access to a clinical testing service which can perform most any clinical test so that we may send a sample to one lab for single or multiple tests of the same samples if necessary. <br />2.) The service provider must provide consistent and accurate results. <br />3.) The results should be sent to the Branch within a timely manner.<br />4.) A testing service that can guarantee sample pickup until 8:00pm and delivery to the testing lab by 10:00am the following day. <br />5.) Service provider must have proper certification for clinical testing and follow regulations established for clinical testing.</p>

States have aligned their own data collection systems and procedures to make reporting on the NIEER developed and owned systems more efficient.   NIEER has established procedures to  update the content of instrumentation to reflect changes in state preschool policies.

Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)<br />The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)<br />The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document.

<p>Attn: Jorge Molina &amp; Nelson Contreras<br />Phone: 56-2-421-3578<br />Fax: 56-2-421-3660</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance to the Undersecretariat of Telecommunications of Chile ("Subtel" or "Grantee") in the planning of a National Emergency Network ("NEN" or "Project").</p>
<p>The NEN is an important component of the efforts of the Government of Chile ("GOC"), on a variety of fronts, to enhance national emergency and disaster response capabilities. Subtel is a GOC agency tasked with oversight over the telecommunications and ICT sectors. The NEN will serve as a common communications facility that will ensure uninterrupted operation under a wide range of emergency and disaster scenarios, while at the same time enabling interconnection and interoperability of existing and future emergency communications networks, thus providing a unified platform.</p>
<p>This Technical Assistance will involve the diagnostic of the national emergency networks, the desired model definition, the gaps identification (between current and desired model), the medium and long term plan to accomplish it, and finally, an RFP for a tender, while a second phase, which is not part of this Technical Assistance, will cover the acquisition of equipment.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $514,548 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p>https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp.</p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal, in both English and Spanish, directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5:00PM local (Santiago) time, May 20, 2013</span></strong>, at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

Other Applicable FAR and VAAR Clauses/Provisions in Full Text:

FAR 52.232-34 -- Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer - Other Than Central Contractor Registration (May 1999)

(a) Method of payment.

(1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term "EFT" refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.

(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either--

(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or

(ii) Request the Government to extend payment due dates until such time as the Government makes payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).

(b) Mandatory submission of Contractor's EFT information. 

(1) The Contractor is required to provide the Government with the information required to make payment by EFT (see paragraph (j) of this clause). The Contractor shall provide this information directly to the office designated in this contract to receive that information (hereafter: ``designated office'') by no later than 15 days prior to submission of the first request for payment If not otherwise specified in this contract, the payment office is the designated office for receipt of the Contractor's EFT information. If more than one designated office is named for the contract, the Contractor shall provide a separate notice to each office. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the designated office(s).

(2) If the Contractor provides EFT information applicable to multiple contracts, the Contractor shall specifically state the applicability of this EFT information in terms acceptable to the designated office. However, EFT information supplied to a designated office shall be applicable only to contracts that identify that designated office as the office to receive EFT information for that contract.

(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210.

(d) Suspension of payment. (1) The Government is not required to make any payment under this contract until after receipt, by the designated office, of the correct EFT payment information from the Contractor. Until receipt of the correct EFT information, any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply.

(2) If the EFT information changes after submission of correct EFT information, the Government shall begin using the changed EFT information no later than 30 days after its receipt by the designated office to the extent payment is made by EFT. However, the Contractor may request that no further payments be made until the updated EFT information is implemented by the payment office. If such suspension would result in a late payment under the prompt payment terms of this contract, the Contractor's request for suspension shall extend the due date for payment by the number of days of the suspension.

(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. 

(1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for--

(i) Making a correct payment;

(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and

(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.

(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and--

(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or

(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment and the provisions of paragraph (d) shall apply.

(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.

(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall provide the EFT information required by paragraph (j) of this clause to the designated office, and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.

(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information provided by the Contractor's financial agent.

(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address in the contract.

(j) EFT information. The Contractor shall provide the following information to the designated office. The Contractor may supply this data for this or multiple contracts (see paragraph (b) of this clause). The Contractor shall designate a single financial agent per contract capable of receiving and processing the EFT information using the EFT methods described in paragraph (c) of this clause.

(1) The contract number (or other procurement identification number).

(2) The Contractor's name and remittance address, as stated in the contract(s).

(3) The signature (manual or electronic, as appropriate), title, and telephone number of the Contractor official authorized to provide this information.

(4) The name, address, and 9-digit Routing Transit Number of the Contractor's financial agent.

(5) The Contractor's account number and the type of account (checking, saving, or lockbox).

(6) If applicable, the Fedwire Transfer System telegraphic abbreviation of the Contractor's financial agent.

(7) If applicable, the Contractor shall also provide the name, address, telegraphic abbreviation, and 9-digit Routing Transit Number of the correspondent financial institution receiving the wire transfer payment if the Contractor's financial agent is not directly on-line to the Fedwire Transfer System; and, therefore, not the receiver of the wire transfer payment.

(End of clause)

  (e) Section III, Operation. Section III will fully describe the operation of the equipment and shall include a listing of each control with a brief description of its function and step-by-step procedures for each operating mode.

For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs. Submission information shall be given in the Maintenance Section to identify equipment malfunctions that are software related.
  (f) Section IV, Principles of Operation. This section shall describe in narrative form the principles of operation of the equipment. Circuitry shall be discussed in sufficient detail to be understood by technicians and engineers who possess a working knowledge of electronics and a general familiarity with the overall application of the devices. The circuit descriptions should start at the overall equipment level and proceed to more detailed circuit descriptions. The overall description shall be keyed to a functional block diagram of the equipment. Circuit descriptions shall be keyed to schematic diagrams discussed in paragraph (i) below. It is recommended that for complex or special circuits, simplified schematics should be included in this section.
  (g) Section V, Maintenance. The maintenance section shall contain a list of recommended test equipment, special tools, preventive maintenance instructions and corrective information. The list of test equipment shall be that recommended by the manufacturer and shall be designated by manufacturer and model number. Special tools are those items not commercially available or those that are designed specifically for the equipment being supplied. Sufficient data will be provided to enable their purchase by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Preventive maintenance instructions shall consist of those recommended by the manufacturer to preclude unnecessary failures. Procedures and the recommended frequency of performance shall be included for visual inspection, cleaning, lubricating, mechanical adjustments and circuit calibration. Corrective maintenance shall consist of the data necessary to troubleshoot and rectify a problem and shall include procedures for realigning and testing the equipment. Troubleshooting shall include either a list of test points with the applicable voltage levels or waveforms that would be present under a certain prescribed set of conditions, a troubleshooting chart listing the symptom, probable cause and remedy, or a narrative containing sufficient data to enable a test technician or electronics engineer to determine and locate the probable cause of malfunction. Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.
  (h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List. The replacement parts list shall list, in alphanumeric order, all electrical/electronic, mechanical and pneumatic components, their description, value and tolerance, true manufacturer and manufacturers' part number.
  (i) Section VII, Drawings. Wiring and schematic diagrams shall be included. The drawings will depict the circuitry using standard symbols and shall include the reference designations and component values or type designators. Drawings shall be clear and legible and shall not be engineering or productions sketches.

      (1) Awards made to foreign vendors for work performed outside the United States;
      (2) Classified contracts or purchases when electronic submission and processing of payment requests could compromise the safeguarding of classified or privacy information;
      (3) Contracts awarded by contracting officers in the conduct of emergency operations, such as responses to national emergencies;
      (4) Solicitations or contracts in which the designated agency office is a VA entity other than the VA Financial Services Center in Austin, Texas; or

(END OF CLAUSE)

VAAR 852.246-71 INSPECTION (JAN 2008)
Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense.

(END OF CLAUSE)


Other Applicable FAR and VARR Provisions

FAR 52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)
(a)

(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --

(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --

(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;

(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and

(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and

(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(2) Examples.

(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.

(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).

This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.


(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.

(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.

(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.

(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

(End of Provision)



FAR 52.216-1 Type of Contract (Apr 1984)

VAAR 852.233-70 -- PROTEST CONTENT/ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (JAN 2008)

(a) Any protest filed by an interested party shall:

(1) Include the name, address, fax number, and telephone number of the protester;

(2) Identify the solicitation and/or contract number;

(3) Include an original signed by the protester or the protester's representative and at least one copy;

(4) Set forth a detailed statement of the legal and factual grounds of the protest, including a description of resulting prejudice to the protester, and provide copies of relevant documents;

(5) Specifically request a ruling of the individual upon whom the protest is served;

(6) State the form of relief requested; and

(7) Provide all information establishing the timeliness of the protest.

(b) Failure to comply with the above may result in dismissal of the protest without further consideration.

(c) Bidders/offerors and contracting officers are encouraged to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) procedures to resolve protests at any stage in the protest process.  If ADR is used, the Department of Veterans Affairs will not furnish any documentation in an ADR proceeding beyond what is allowed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

(End of Provision)


VAAR 852.233-71
(xiii) Additional contract requirement(s) or terms and conditions (such as contract financing arrangements or warranty requirements) determined by the contracting officer to be necessary for this acquisition and consistent with customary commercial practices are listed below.
All necessary supplies to successfully operate the electric patient transport stretcher must be provided and incorporated into the unit price of the stretcher.
The required 2 year warranty for the electric patient transport stretcher must be provided and incorporated into the unit price of the stretcher.
852.273-70 Late offers.
This provision replaces paragraph (f) of FAR provision 52.212-1. Offers or modifications of offers received after the time set forth in a request for quotations or request for proposals may be considered, at the discretion of the contracting officer, if determined to be in the best interest of the Government. Late bids submitted in response to an invitation for bid (IFB) will not be considered.

<DESC>*** 5 April 2013 ***<br />There have been some clarification questions asked regarding the purchase description. The questions and responses are listed below. As a result of these questions, there has been a new revision of the purchase description, Revision 5 dated 5 April 2013. Also, there are some additional quantity changes resulting in changes to the data requirements as well as the Schedule B. Revision 5 of the purcahse description, the new data requirements, and the updated Schedule B will all be posted to this site.
<p>Question: 4.3 Modulation:</p>
<p>PM modulation capability is mentioned in the para 1 Scope, but no PM requirements are listed in the Modulation Requirements section. Can you add specifications to make this clear?</p>
<p>Response: I removed "PM" from the scope paragraph. It's not required.</p>
<p><br />Question: 5.18 Grounding:</p>
<p>The sentence is incomplete and the requirement unclear. "Grounding: During operation of the fully assembled test equipment, all electrically"</p>
<p>Response: Not sure what happened there but I fixed the rest of the grounding paragraph. Also I noticed that when I went from rev 3 to 4 it dropped the Model and serial number identification paragraph. This paragraph was next to the incomplete grounding paragraph.</p>

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor?s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via CCR accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (Feb 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). ___Alternate I (Aug 2007) of 52.222-50 (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)).

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 3 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR PASSIVE COMMON BERTHING MECHANISM - PCBM.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to publish the following questions and answers: The following questions are related to Analysis in the SOW (excerpted): 2.0	   CAD modeling, Analysis, Manufacture, and acceptance testing of the PCBM (CLIN 0001) During the first CLIN 0001 contract period, the Contractor shall produce a PCBM that meets the NASA requirements defined in SSP 41004, SSP 41148 and SSP 57239. A Computer Aided Design (CAD) package for the PCBM assembly shall be delivered to NASA. Preliminary structural analysis shall be performed to insure that the PCBM to BEAM interface bolts have positive margins for the environments defined in SPP 57239 and SPP 41004 and that loss of preload (gapping) will not occur. Manufacture shall occur in accordance with SSP 41004, assembly drawing 683-13472-1 and sub-assembly drawings.  CLIN 0001 TASK 2 -- ANALYSIS The Contractor shall perform and deliver to NASA preliminary analysis (including structural and mechanical loading) of the PCBM to BEAM bolts to verify that the design survives the ground (S683-28943 Rev E) environment, ISS (SSP 57239) environment, and Dragon environments (IDD SPX00001047, rev. 15  cargo flight environments only) with positive margins and no loss of preload. Results shall be documented in a formal stress analysis. CLIN 0001 Task 2 Deliverables: a. The second milestone (Task 2.2) will be met 5 months after ATP with analysis results summarized in a set of briefing charts and a preliminary stress report CLIN 0001 Task 3 Task Deliverables: c.  The fifth CLIN 0001 milestone (Task 2.3) will be met when the final stress report is delivered to NASA (12 months after ATP). Question:  What is the expectation for level of finite detail in Analysis? Answer:  The analysis should consist of calculation of loads and margins for the bolts at the BEAM to PCBM interface only. A structural model of the PCBM structure can be provided by the government if needed but contractor hand calculations are acceptable. The analysis should verify no gapping at the PCBM to BEAM interface under the integrated mechanical loads (to be provided by the government). This should not be a complicated analysis. Question:  Does this analysis include thermal analysis or has that already been performed by Bigelow Aerospace? Answer:  An integrated thermal analysis is not required by the PCBM contractor. Temperatures of the PCBM and the BEAM bulkhead as well as bulkhead tbar will be provided to the vendor by the government for calculation of thermally induced bolt loads. A simple alpha-delta T calculation will suffice. The due date for receipt of offers is not extended. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on March 18, 2013. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK<br />Project Title: Technical Writer/Editor, Smart Grid Program</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF TASK</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Smart Grid is a key component of the Obama Administration's energy plan and its strategy for U.S. innovation. By integrating digital computing and communication technologies and services with the power-delivery infrastructure, the Smart Grid will enable bidirectional flows of energy and two-way communication and control capabilities. A range of new applications and capabilities will result. Anticipated benefits range from real-time consumer control over energy usage to significantly increased reliance on solar and other sources of clean renewable energy to greatly improve reliability, flexibility and efficiency of the entire grid.</p>
<p>The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) set development of the Smart Grid as a national policy goal, and it assigned the National Institute of Standards and Technology the "primary responsibility to coordinate development of a framework that includes protocols and model standards for information management to achieve interoperability of Smart Grid devices and systems ..."</p>
<p>To date NIST has issued the first release of a Smart Grid interoperability framework and roadmap for its further development. It has also launched a Smart Grid Interoperability Panel (SGIP) to assist NIST in carrying out its EISA-assigned responsibility, including working with regulatory bodies on evaluating and implementing standards in this and subsequent releases of the NIST interoperability framework.</p>
<p>A public-private partnership, the SGIP is designed to provide "a more permanent process" to support the evolution of the interoperability framework and further development of standards, according to the report. With NIST, the report explains, the panel will "identify and address additional gaps, assess changes in technology and associated requirements for standards, and provide ongoing coordination" of standards organizations' efforts to support timely availability of needed Smart Grid standards.</p>
<p>Nearly 700 organizations have joined the SGIP. Over 1,742 individuals from membership organizations have signed up to participate in the panel's technical activities.<br />Engaging, timely communications with stakeholders for the NIST Smart Grid program is an essential necessary element for the program to achieve its goals. These stakeholders are extremely diverse and include President Obama, the Secretary of Energy and other senior-level federal officials; state and local electrical power regulators and companies; elected officials; electronic and IT equipment manufacturers; and consumers.</p>
<p>To ensure that stakeholders are fully informed about the very wide range of activities affecting development of standards and deployment of Smart Grid infrastructure components, the NIST Smart Grid program requires professional communications services from a contractor with demonstrated technical knowledge of the fields of physical science (especially energy research), electronics, and information technology, as well as proven ability to translate complex technical materials into engaging Web sites, reports, and other communications products intended for a broad public audience.</p>
<p>GENERAL REQUIREMENTS<br />The Contractor shall have at least five (5) years of experience in journalist writing and editing.

<p><br />Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory<br />Statement of Work Repair of Laboratory Exhaust Fans<br />1.	Introduction</p>
<p>The Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, located on Virginia Key, Florida is a research facility owned by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The main building was commissioned in 1973 and consists of roughly 78,000 square feet of office, laboratory, workshop, machinery, and storage space.</p>
<p>2.	Scope</p>
<p>2.1	General<br />NOAA is seeking a vendor capable of performing repairs to certain components of the Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems at the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, Virginia Key, FL.  The scope of work consists of, but is not strictly limited to, the furnishing of all labor and materials required to repair, and extend the service life of, four laboratory exhaust fans.</p>
<p>2.2	Background<br />Numerous laboratory spaces within AOML are served by fume hoods, which in turn vent to a redundant laboratory exhaust fan system (i.e. two fans each at two separate locations) on the 4th floor roof of the main building.  These exhaust fans are operated on an alternating schedule, i.e. one fan is continuously operating at each location for about one month at a time.  Since their installation about 10 years ago, these fans have been continuously exposed to both harsh chemical fumes and a tropical, coastal environment that includes constant inundation with salt air and sunlight.  The fans have corroded significantly since their installation and are in need of repair to extend their service life by approximately 2-3 years, until new fans can be budgeted and procured.  Additionally, one fan requires repair of moving parts.</p>
<p>2.3	 Work Items<br />2.3.1	Replace the wind bands on two fans:<br />2.3.1.1	Procure two (2) replacement wind bands for fans EF-9B and EF-15B.  See Section 3.3 for information about the existing wind bands.<br />2.3.1.2	Remove the existing wind bands from the fan housings on exhaust fans EF-9B and EF-15B.  Dispose of these wind bands as directed by the AOML Associate Director (ADIR).<br />2.3.1.3	Prepare the surface of both fan housings such that the new wind bands can be bolted (via four attachment points) in a structurally sound manner.  This will require rotating the four attachment points from areas of corroded metal on the fan housings to areas of solid metal.<br />2.3.1.4	Bolt the two new wind bands to the EF-9B and EF-15B housings.<br />2.3.1.5	Treat and preserve the entirety of both fan housings per the procedure specified in section 2.5.<br />2.3.2	Remove, replace, test, and certify the following components for exhaust fan EF-15A:<br />2.3.2.1	Motor and blower wheel pulleys<br />2.3.2.2	Bearings on blower wheel shaft<br />2.3.2.3	Belt and bushings<br />2.3.3	Replacement components shall be new equipment only.  There shall be no reconditioned or "gray market" items. All equipment shall have the same specifications as the existing and shall be covered by the manufacturer's warranty.</p>
<p>2.4	 Optional Item<br />2.4.1	The optional item involves metal repairs on the four (4) modular, double-walled Bypass Air Plenums (BAP) of exhaust fans EF-9A, EF-9B, EF-15A, and EF-15B.  Each BAP is in different condition and requires different repairs.<br />2.4.2	Treat and preserve corroded metal surfaces of each BAP per section 2.5.1 through 2.5.3.<br />2.4.3	Repair areas of metal wasting (including plenum skirts) and rust-through corrosion such that each BAP is structurally sound and sufficiently sealed to function effectively as an air plenum.  These repairs can be made through any combination of sheet metal, metal compound, and/or fiberglass patching.  If sheet metal patching is used, the metal shall be corrosion resistant steel of similar gauge.<br />2.4.4	Paint all surfaces per section 2.5.4-2.5.5.</p>
<p>2.5	 Metal treatment and preservation - minimum acceptable procedure<br />2.5.1	Remove all large rust and scale particles with a chipping hammer, scaling tool, wire brush, and/or sandpaper.<br />2.5.2	Clean and degrease all rusted surfaces with acetone, and let dry.<br />2.5.3	Apply two (2) coats of Skyco Ospho rust converter to all rusted surfaces with a brush.  Allow each coat to dry for a minimum of 24 hours. <br />2.5.4	Apply one (1) coat of Devoe Bar Rust 235 primer, oxide red color, to all treated and repaired surfaces.  Let dry for a minimum of 8 hours.<br />2.5.5	Apply one topcoat of Devoe 379 to all primed surfaces, with color to approximately match existing top color.</p>
<p>2.6	Period of Performance<br />This work shall be completed before June 1, 2013.</p>
<p>2.7	Site Familiarization<br />A pre-bid site visit is not required but is strongly recommended due to the variety of repairs required. Available photographs are included as a separate attachment.  Photos were taken after a recent rust converter spray treatment.<br /> <br />2.8	 Standards and Certifications<br />2.8.1	All work performed under this contract shall be in accordance with ANSI/ASSE Standard Z9.5-2012, Laboratory Ventilation.<br />2.8.2	All work shall be warrantied for a period of 90 days.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br /><br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br /><br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<DESC><p>Government Responses to Questions Received as of April 5, 2013.<br />1) What is the diameter of the cold stop and its distance from the focal plane in the FLIR cameras on which the custom objectives will be used? The cameras are the SC6000-QWIP and the SC8203-InSb.<br />Answer Question 1:<br />Back working distance is contained the ICD for each camera, which is not releasable by the Government. For more information about each camera model, please contact FLIR Advanced Thermal Systems in Niceville, FL.</p>
<p>2) Is it possible to obtain the spectral quantum efficiencies of the two cameras above?<br />Answer Question 2:<br />See the response to question 1.</p>
<p>3) Both statements of requirements state:<br />The lens must meet the following resolution requirements over the entire waveband (whether 7.8 - 9 or 1.7 - 4.8 mm, depending on the objective):<br />- The Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) must be 20% or more at 20 line pairs per mm (lpm) over 90% of the field;<br />- The MTF must be 40% or more at 12 lpm over 90% of the field;<br />Could you please confirm that the MTF values specified are for the square wave modulation transfer, and not for a sine wave pattern?<br />Answer Question 3: Confirmed.</p>
<p>4) Could you please clarify the expression "over the entire waveband" in the MTF requirements? Does it imply that the required MTF is a polychromatic MTF, which is measured with flux from all wavelengths at once, or does it mean that the MTF specification must be met for each wavelength individually without refocusing?<br />Answer Question 4: Polychromatic MTF.</p>
<p>5) Could you please clarify the meaning of "over 90 % of the field" in the MTF requirements? Is 100 % the area of the focal plane, or the distance between its center and its corner?<br />Answer Question 5: The distance between the center and the corner.</p>

<DESC><p>Purpose: The purpose of this notice is to invite interested roofing contractors to a Pre-Proposal Conference in conjunction with the anticipated release of the draft Request For Proposal (dRFP).<br /><br />The Enterprise Sourcing Group (ESG) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is transforming the way the U.S. Air Force purchases its roofing repair and replacement needs. The ESG will move the Air Force to a regional contract model representing approximately $325 million in total roofing requirements over five years. This will represent a significant change in roofing acquisition for both the Air Force and roofing contractors.</p>
<p>As part of an ongoing effort to more efficiently procure roofing for the Air Force, the ESG is preparing to solicit a targeted number of multiple award, regional indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ)-type contracts covering Air Force bases located in the contiguous U.S. This approach is a transformational shift from traditional base-specific contracts to a more strategic approach designed to address ongoing budget and manpower challenges.<br /><br />In conjunction with anticipated release of the draft Request for Proposal, the ESG will be hosting a Pre-Proposal Conference to communicate the preliminary contract requirements that will be contained in the dRFP and to obtain input from interested roofing contractors. The Conference will be offered both in-person as well as broadcast over the Internet for those unable to travel (see registration links below). There will be no conference fee to participate. Proposed discussion topics for the event include:</p>
<p>&bull; Overview of Strategic Sourcing<br />&bull; Role of Small Business and Teaming Arrangements<br />&bull; Overview of the Air Force Roofing Strategy &amp; Objectives<br />&bull; Review of the draft RFP<br /><br />Interested contractors are invited to participate in this Conference in order to learn about this upcoming business opportunity and provide feedback to the Air Force. Additionally, this event will provide an opportunity for contractors to network with potential teaming partners and/or subcontractors.<br /><br />It is the intention of the ESG to release the dRFP by the end of March 2013 which will be posted to FBO as a modification to this Special Notice.</p>
<p>Details of the Pre-Proposal Conference are as follows:</p>
<p>Date: Wednesday, 17 April 2013<br />Duration: 1 Day (approximately 8am-5pm EDT)<br />Location: <br />Kenney Hall<br />Air Force Institute of Technology<br />2950 Hobson Way<br />Bldg 642, Area B<br />Wright Patterson AFB<br />Dayton, OH</p>
<p>Please note that the date and location may be subject to change in the event of Sequestration or other unforeseen delays, and the Government cannot be held liable for any costs incurred by you or your company should there be any unforeseen changes to the event. Attendance at the Pre-Proposal Conference, while encouraged, is completely voluntary.</p>

Marshall Center of the U.S. Department of State. The mission of INL is to minimize the impact of international crime and illegal drugs on the United States and its citizens through providing effective foreign assistance and through fostering global cooperation. <br />The forum will provide an opportunity to learn first-hand about our international criminal justice assistance and rule of law programs and meet INL program managers. INL's senior leaders will provide an overview of mission and program priorities during a plenary session followed by an informal meet-and-greet session with INL Bureau program officers. The forum is an outreach event; no solicitation document exists at this time.

We request organizations RSVP by April 5, 2013, and limit their RSVPs to no more than two individuals for the plenary session.

You will be notified by April 12, 2013, whether there is space to attend the event, and if availability permits, you will be provided with registration and day-of-event instructions.<br /><br />INL is extending the deadline to RSVP from April 5, 2013 to April 12, 2013, but still request that organizations limit their RSVPs to no more than two individuals for the plenary session. Organizations will be notified by April 17, 2013, whether there is space to attend the event, and if availability permits, provided with registration.</p>

Vendors are also encouraged to register to receive notices about this announcement by using the "Watch This Opportunity" link on the FBO website. NOTE: The Government will NOT be maintaining a manual list of interested vendors.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: The objective of this Contract is to provide integrated telecommunications services, and any associated management, for the General Service Administration (GSA), Federal Technology Service (FTS), Office of Network Services, Northwest Arctic Region (here forward referred to as "GSA" and/or "the Government") at various locations throughout the State of Alaska. These services include but are not limited to analog and digital Centrex-like technology, individual business lines, data services, support systems to easily add new services, and consolidated management and integrated order processing systems with the highest level of reliability and support. Services must be commercially available, meet industry standards for performance and transmission, be capable of interfacing with GSA's existing and future long distance services, and have capabilities and capacities to meet current and potential Government needs.</p>
<p>PROJECT DURATION: The Government anticipates an eight (8) year contract performance period, inclusive of both base period and option periods. <br /><br />COMPETITION: Unrestricted. This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform the resultant contract, will be required to submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT STRATGY: The successful offeror will be selected using the Best Value Source Selection process pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3. One or more firm fixed price (FFP) indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts are anticipated to be awarded. The successful offeror awarded the resultant contract shall be authorized to provide telecommunication services in the State of Alaska (and any subset thereof, i.e. borough, as applicable). Proof of this certification from the applicable authorities (i.e. State Public Utility Commissions, municipalities, etc.) shall be provided with submission of proposals.</p>
<p>The solicitation shall require submission of proposal prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15. The solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award, using the best value trade-off approach, upon the basis of the initial offers without discussions.</p>
<p>CONTRACT AWARD: GSA FAS R10 contemplates awarding one or more Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts to the successful offeror(s) that demonstrates the best value to the Government, price and non-price factors considered. NOTE: At time of this Synopsis posting, it is the Government's intent to identify geographic areas within the State of Alaska which will each be awarded one FFP IDIQ contract, thus permitting a multiple single-award IDIQ strategy wherein one offeror may be awarded more than one geographic area, but no one geographic area shall have more than one IDIQ awarded as a result of this Solicitation. Final determination and further information related to this concept shall be provided in the RFP once issued, if applicable.</p>
<p>SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE: The RFP will be issued electronically on or about 3/18/2013 on the internet at: http://www.fbo.gov/.</p>
<p>CLOSING DATE: The closing date for receipt of proposals shall be specified in the RFP but is estimated to be on or about 5/1/2013.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.</p>

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) TBD is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract. The COR is located at: TBD
(b) The responsibilities and limitations of the COR are as follows: (1) The COR is responsible for the technical aspects of the contract and serves as technical liaison with the contractor. The COR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all deliverables and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the contract. (2) The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the contract price, terms or conditions. Any contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COR. No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may designate assistant or alternate COR(s) to act for the COR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the contractor. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest.

The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

Question: Is the due date April 22, 2013?

ANSWER: The due date is April 28, 2013.  Please make sure you enter your questions prior to the closing date of the solicitation.

Please keep in mind the size of your proposal being sent via email, due to the limits we can accept.

Question: Is there a made in the  USA preference?
ANSWER: Yes.

QUESTION: What was the existing equipment?
ANSWER: 4500 lb currently manufactured by Raymond.
 Industry has gone from DC to AC. 

Clarifications on Technically Acceptable by Rick Fry 10:09a.m.
"Under technically acceptable criteria you must quote directly with the requirements in the solicitation. 
If you propose something separately you will be found technically unacceptable; however you may provide the government with one quote based on the current requirements and also quote an alternative tehcnical proposal to the government in addition.  The government reserves the right to review offers proposed outside of the requirements in the solicitation if they find it suitable, at which point this will be proposed to all offers to quote in accordance with this potential new change."

Question:Did Raymond make this application specifically for you all?

ANSWER: No.
 No one makes the 6,000 lb truck. Plus it has the AC controls, where as the current truck uses DC.

Question: What about the ground bearing pressure weight and the total weight? 
ANSWER: You need both because you need the deck pressure within limits and the total weight because you have to take it up and down the elevators.

Question: Do you have any IP ratings?
ANSWER: Yes. Salt water and electro magnetic interference (EMI).

QUESTION: Will you list it as public ratings?
ANSWER: No. We do not have an IP rating to release. There are standards on the salt fog and standards on the EMI.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets, and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS) Instrumentation Management Office (IMO) is performing market research to identify interested sources for a potential new contract for numerous efforts to support the objectives of IMO and its customers, including, but not limited to Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC), Office of the Secretary of Defense Test Resource Management Center (TRMC), Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), other Program Executive Offices (PEOs) and Project Management Offices (PMOs), Defense Laboratories, and other Defense Services and Agencies.  IMO activities focus primarily on areas that would utilize a Services type contract vehicle, with the added ability to deliver instrumentation related hardware, software and/or integrated solutions.  <br>    <br>  Program Description: PM ITTS IMO requires a contract to address the acquisition life cycle of instrumentation related capabilities.   Test Instrumentation, Enterprise, Development and Support (TIEDS) is geared towards the full spectrum of the instrumentation requirement, research, development, production, integration, and sustainment processes.  TIEDS is expected to allow PM ITTS IMO to respond to evolving technology and military demands.  The spectrum of services required range from requirements analysis and concept exploration to rapid prototyping, system development, system sustainment and other related tasks.    <br>    <br>  This Sources Sought Notice (SSN) is being issued to determine industry capabilities and identify potential sources for the procurement of the TIEDS effort.  A draft Statement of Work (SOW) for the overarching effort is provided as well as sample Task Orders for your review and to assist you in determining your interest in participating.  The Government requests that you provide your expression of interest by submitting a capability statement regarding the requirements included in the draft SOWs as follows:  <br>    <br>  Cover Page:  Include a cover sheet with the company name, address, Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, and point of contact with name, title, phone number, and email address.  Also indicate the SSN title and number.  <br>    <br>  Format:  Font shall not be smaller than industry standard word processor 12-point Times New Roman.  Electronic submissions shall be in MS Word format.  Only electronic submissions are acceptable. The Government is not soliciting proprietary information; however, if submitted, it should be appropriately marked.   <br>    <br>  Length:  Do not exceed 15 pages (one side is counted as one page), exclusive of the cover page.    <br>    <br>  Size of Business:  Provide a statement indicating if your firm is a large or small business under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541330.  Small businesses must comply with FAR 52.219-14 - Limitation of Subcontracting, regarding contract performance.  Please identify how you plan to comply if the acquisition is set aside.  If you are a small business only interested in subcontracting opportunities, please identify the areas you are interested in supporting.  If a small business, identify if you are disadvantaged, 8(a), Disabled-Veteran, Veteran, Women-owned Business, or Hub-zone.    <br>    <br>  The capability statement should contain sufficient detail for the Government to make an informed decision regarding your capabilities.  <br>    <br>  Technical:  The TIEDS effort will be comprised of an overarching program management function that will oversee the integration and/or sustainment of various assets delivered under TIEDS task orders or outside (COTS, other contract) sources.   It is expected that the Program Management functions will be paid through each individual Task Order and not as a separate Program Management Task Order.  <br>    <br>  i.	 Overall Project Management and Execution:   <br>    <br>  	a.  Describe how you would manage an ID/IQ contract whereby all program management tasks are funded by individual Task Orders.   There could be instances when a significant surge of program management efforts (proposal preparation, IPT coordination, etc.) is required. These surges could be random and without notice, yet require a quick turnaround (i.e. 4th quarter of the fiscal year). Identify your process for staffing and processing multiple proposals, while still managing current efforts. Describe your ability to surge to meet demands.   <br>    <br>  b.  Describe your past performance with regard to lifecycle tasks associated with Test Instrumentation and related technologies.  Respond with your past performance regarding the following topics:    <br>  -	Test data collection, reduction, and analysis  <br>  -	Real time casualty assessment  <br>  -	Test design, planning, and control  <br>  -	Test infrastructure planning and establishment  <br>  -	Software development, sustainment, training and integration  <br>  -	Field support of end products and architectures  <br>  -	Support of key testing related technological areas (please be specific).  For example, experience related to testing aviation, nuclear effects, interoperability, network performance, urban operations, facilities construction, etc.  <br>    <br>  c.  If currently supporting ATEC, TRMC, and/or TRADOC, please provide information of current or past efforts.  <br>    <br>  ii.	Individual Task Order Management and Execution:  <br>    <br>  a.	Describe your approach to support Task Orders, sometimes with loosely defined requirements, as they arise. Include your process and approach to provide rough order of magnitude (ROM) on cost, schedule, and performance with expedient turnaround times.  Include relevant technical history that demonstrates your technical skill sets from work completed.  <br>    <br>  b.	Describe your ability to operate in an Integrated Product Team (IPT) environment with the Government and/or its customer(s) to meet very short timelines to make decisions, meet documentation and programmatic suspense's, and execute acquisition tasks such as the ones listed below.  <br>    <br>    <br>    <br>  c.	Describe your approach to include but not limited to labor categories, timelines, costs and deliverables for each attached Task Order (i.e., list the SOW Names here).     <br>    <br>  Respondents are asked to submit replies no later than 1200 PM Eastern Time on April 1st, 2013 by email to jason.malak@us.army.mil with a courtesy copy to Mr. Dennis Schneider (dennis.j.schneider@us.army.mil). In addition to your capability statement, you are invited to submit questions/comments as a result of your review of the draft SOWs.  Please provide your questions in a separate attachment from your capability statement.  There is no specified format; however, please use 12-point Times New Roman and submit electronically in MS Word.  Responses to questions will be consolidated and posted to FedBizOpps.  <br>    <br>  The Government anticipates a Single Award ID/IQ contract vehicle to be awarded.  The CLIN structure for the task orders will be structured appropriately to the level of effort to be performed.  CLINs may be Firm Fixed Price, Time and Materials, or Cost type.    <br>    <br>  This action does not constitute a solicitation or Request for Proposal and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure the subject products, services or information.  The submission of this information is for PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any supplies or services, or for the Government to pay for the information received.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this notice.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS AT THIS TIME.  This information is for program planning and acquisition strategy development.  <br>  <br>  <br> UPDATE 5 APRIL 2013: <br>  <br> Attached is the list of respondents and contact information to the Sources Sought Notice posting for TIEDS. <br>    <br>

<DESC>UPDATE 4/5/2013 UPLOADING ATTACHMENT 14 IT WORKSHEETS, WHICH ARE PART OF THE RFP.<br />==<br />The Center for Mental Health Services and Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Department of Health and Human Services, has a requirement to award a one year cost reimbursement contract with four option years entitled "Tribal Training and Technical Assistance Center" Reference No. 280-13-0406. This project is competitive under the 8(a) program under NAICS Code 541990. This acquisition is subject to the availability of funds. The purpose of this project is to provide comprehensive broad, focused, and/or intensive training and technical assistance (TTA) to federally-recognized tribes and other American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN/) communities, seeking to address and prevent mental and substance use disorders, suicide, and promote mental health. This contract shall use a culturally relevant, evidence-based, holistic approach to support native communities in their self-determination efforts through infrastructure development, capacity building, as well as program planning and implementation. The TTA contractor shall specifically provide proactive planning/implementation of substance abuse prevention and mental health programming focused on native children, youth, and their families to (1) decrease the impact of risk factors, such as poverty, unemployment, racism and historical trauma that contribute to suicide, family disruption, youth violence including bullying, and high-risk substance use, and (2) increase the protective factors, such as strengthening cultural identity, a sense of family and community connectedness, and communication skills, that are linked to the healthy and safe development of AI/AN children and their families. Through collaboration and coordination with internal and external TTA providers and other native-focused organizations, the contract shall get the best value for limited prevention resources, tailoring the tools necessary to increase community protective factors that can serve to reduce suicide, violence, and substance abuse.<br />The focus of this contract is to address and prevent mental and substance use disorders, suicide, and promote mental health in native communities and families by providing culturally relevant and meaningful TTA that honors tribal culture and ways of life as well as respects and protects government-to-government relations. Native populations have the knowledge, capacity, and strength to address the risk factors that affect their communities. Cultural beliefs and practices provide a foundation for taking action, solving problems, and promoting lasting wellness among tribal communities, families, and youth.

<DESC>Work executed under these MATOCs is limited to the geographic boundaries of the Southwestern Division (SWD) consisting of Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas and those nationwide customers where SWD has been designated as the primary responsible agent for the Corps of Engineers via established agreements. However, because SWD services customers whose boundaries exceed the geographical area, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure that possible execution gaps can be covered. Therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical area or for nationwide customers identified above as long as capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement. If capacity is used outside the SWD geographic boundaries for other than the Division's nationwide customers, prior MSC coordination will be made or capacity will be granted tothe appropriate geographic District. <br>  <br> Any work executed under these MATOCs is limited to the geographic boundaries of SWD and those nationwide customers where SWD has been designated as the -One Door to the Corps- via established MOAs. However, because SWD services customers whose boundaries exceed this geographic area, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure that possible execution gaps can be covered. Therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical area or for nationwide customers identified above as long as capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement. <br>  <br> WHEN SOLICITED, IT WILL BE ISSUED UNDER RFP NUMBER: W9126G-13-R-0014 <br>  <br> Pre-solicitation Synopsis Notice Small Business Request for Proposal (RFP) for Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs) for Construction Services for the United States Army Corps of Engineer (USACE) in Southwestern Division (SWD) and its surrounding areas consisting of Arizona, Arkansas, California, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. <br>  <br> The Contract Specialist point of contact for this anticipated solicitation will be Ms. Jennifer Fox at 817-886-1220, email Jennifer.R.Fox@usace.army.mil. <br>  <br> FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This Synopsis is ONLY A NOTIFICATION that a solicitation is anticipated and forthcoming.

The maximum combination of orders is $75,000,000. The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation. Task orders issued as a result of Small Business contracts will be firm-fixed price. The minimum guarantee for the Small Business MATOC contract is $2,500 that applies to the base period only. The minimum guarantee amount will be applicable to the base period only. Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated with the issuance of task orders. <br>  <br> CONTRACT INFORMATION: Small Business solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process. In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as quote mark Offerors quote mark ) may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the performance capacity in accordance with the criteria described in Phase 1 solicitation and intends to select up to ten (10) of the Phase 1 Offerors to compete in Phase 2. In addition, the Government reserves the right to select more than ten (10) of the Phase 1 Offerors if, in the opinion of the Source Selection Authority, consideration of additional Offerors is warranted. In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal. The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.

Phase1 Proposals are anticipated to be due on or about 06/03/2013. (30 days from issuance of the solicitation).

There must be a minimum of at least two awards to create this MATOC pool but, if there are not enough Offerors in this pool to establish at least two or more contract awards, the remaining contract capacity of that MATOC pool will be distributed by; (1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the pools that have not been awarded, or (2) re-advertising the solicitation after ensuring that the evaluation criteria established in the solicitation were not overly restrictive which resulted in limiting competition. Option 1 would not be a viable solution if all other pools have been awarded. If option 1 is not viable and the evaluation criteria have been reviewed then SWD reserves the right to solicit an additional MATOC pool only for the amount of the un-awarded capacity. New market research will be conducted to determine the appropriate set-aside, if any, for the MATOC for the unawarded capacity. Each small business synopsis and solicitation would notify potential Offerors of this reservation. The total estimated contract capacity is $537,840,000. The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months with up to 4 Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of 60 months. The Government reserves the right to award a contract for a lesser duration than stated herein if it is determined in the best interests of the Government. <br>  <br> The anticipated solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition. There will be no public bid opening. This solicitation is set-aside for competitive Small Businesses only. Plans and Specifications will not be provided in a hard paper copy since electronic copy of the solicitation with specifications and drawings will be posted on Fed Biz Opps (www.fbo.gov). Offerors must be registered with the System for Award Management (SAM) and not a debarred Contractor in order to be considered for a Government award contract. <br>

3.  STATEMENT OF SERVICES:  The A/E shall perform all or part of the following services as more specifically identified in each delivery order.

a.	Title I (Type "A" Services).  The A/E shall perform all work required to investigate existing conditions (Pre-Design).  This work includes field investigations and surveys (topographic, geotechnical, chemical, site utilities, existing mechanical etc.), energy modeling/analysis, commissioning and similar fact finding surveys of the site in order to provide reports of existing conditions on which to base proper design; and similar services not involved in the preparation of designs, plans, drawings, and specifications.

b.	Title I (Type "B") Services:  The A/E shall perform those items normally furnished by an A/E in the actual preparation of the design documents (plans, drawings, estimates, specifications, submittal register, Comprehensive Interior Design, etc.) in the Schematic, Design Development and Construction Document phases.  The A/E shall perform all work required to produce documents describing the work required to accomplish the project as specifically identified in each Task Order (TO).  Unless otherwise specifically provided therein, the A/E shall perform these services as follows.

1)	Field Survey and Investigation:  The A/E shall visually inspect the site and/or facility for familiarization with the scope of work and general conditions of the facility.  Coordinate with the using activities to obtain their operational activities for the development of functional relationships and detailed requirements.  The A/E shall visit the project site for investigation of the existing physical conditions and to ensure the accuracy of the drawings, as available, furnished to the A/E by the Government.

2)	Cost Estimates:  The A/E shall design each project to provide a complete and usable facility within a given target construction cost provided by the Government.  The target construction cost will be provided to the contractor in our requests for proposal and on the executed contractual document, the Standard Form 252.  The A/E cost estimates shall be based on labor and material prices prevailing in the project's locality.  Cost estimates shall be descriptive, detailed, and includes all operations of work required including quantities and unit costs.  Additionally the construction cost estimate shall include Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and contractor furnished equipment when applicable.  The A/E cost estimate shall summarize all cost by material, labor, other direct costs, overhead, profit, and bonding costs.  Cost estimates shall be prepared on an electronic version of the VA Form 08-6277, RS Means Standard Excel Format or CO pre-approved A/E equivalent electronic spreadsheet that provides the information specified above.

3)	Project Costs:  The A/E shall be required to conduct the field survey and investigations, prepare the preliminary drawings, data, reports, etc., and design the full scope of the work as outlined above and as agreed upon during review of study data and recommendations.  If the estimated costs exceeds the amount indicated on the project description sheets for each project (based on current anticipated scope and subject to adjustment to approved scope), sufficient alternates to the construction contract should be determined at the time of the preliminary review conference to reduce the cost below this amount, if deemed necessary by the Government.  Cost estimates, and computation sheets prepared by the A/E shall be marked "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY".

4)	Phasing Plans, Impact Mitigation, and Energy.  Construction work will be in occupied Medical Centers and every effort will be made to interface construction with Medical Center operations. To minimize impact this means the preparation of detailed phasing plans including associated moves.  Phasing plans will show exact areas of work along with specific outage times, infection control risk assessment (ICRA) mitigation measures (including specific dust, noise, debris control), interim life safety measures (ILSM) which provide for specific measures to mitigate any reduction in fire protection features (i.e., exits out of service, fire sprinkler removal, etc).  Utility outages will be carefully planned and included it the contract in order to allow all OSHA required safety measures to be maintained while continuing Medical Center operations.  (For example, outages must provide means to shut off and lock out / tag out equipment while still allowing for Medical Center to continue operations).  Project must meet all legal requirements and executive orders including EPAC 2005, EISA 2007, EO 13514, and EO13423 all dealing with environmental, energy, and water as specifically applied to Federal Buildings.  This requires up front analysis and planning.  This indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract will be for one basic period of year (12 months), with 4 option years (12 months each).  

c.	Title II (Type "C" Services):  Those items involving inspecting, monitoring, commissioning and evaluating construction activities to validate conformance to plans and specifications.  These services include reviewing, evaluating and testing product submittals and shop drawing and preparation of construction contract modifications.

d.	Applicable Standards, Manuals, and Directives:  The A/E shall prepare all design documents in conformance with the applicable portions of the following:

1) VHA Standard Format (http://www.cfm.va.gov/til/dManual.asp).

2) Applicable VHA Directives, Instructions, Pamphlets, Manuals or other documents as directed by the VISN-19 Station Engineer or Chief of Design.  

Note - The VA has a series of design guides and space planning tools in addition to VA Master Specifications.  These will generally be minimum standards but may be adjusted to meet other requirements such as energy and environmental compliance.   Modifications are to be approved by the VA.

3) Current state and national codes, regulations, and specifications involving architectural, civil, electrical, environmental, and mechanical disciplines associated with the design and construction of each project as referenced by VHA or CO direction.

4) Public Laws and Executive Orders with specific reference to EPAC 2005, EISA 2007, Environmental Policy, EO 13423, EO 13514, etc.  

Note - Environmental impacts must be evaluated and either meet categorical exclusion or have a full environmental assessment performed.   Many VA buildings are considered historic and this will need to be considered throughout the design.  Reference sources are available upon request by either websites or government furnished.

e. Guide Specifications:  The A/E shall use VHA guide specifications (section 2.c) as the basis for producing specifications under this contract.  The specifications shall be tailored to suit the specific work requirements of the individual items contained in the TO.  Extraneous material that does not apply shall be deleted.  An overall table of contents will be provided for all design specifications utilized for each project design accomplished.  While the A/E should cover relevant items in full scope to assure quality construction and compliance, the use of notes on the drawings either to accentuate important items in the specifications, or to take the place of lengthy written specifications for routine or simple items is encouraged.  Entire specifications for simple projects of low monetary value may be by notes on the drawings.  The A/E is permitted to use specific manufacturer's part or model numbers to describe a specified item, however, in all such cases, at least two other approved manufacturer's part or model numbers shall be specified in an "or equal" statement which shall be included unless the government wishes to sole source an item.

3.  STATEMENT OF SERVICES:  The A/E shall perform all or part of the following services as more specifically identified in each delivery order.

a.	Title I (Type "A" Services).  The A/E shall perform all work required to investigate existing conditions (Pre-Design).  This work includes field investigations and surveys (topographic, geotechnical, chemical, site utilities, existing mechanical etc.), energy modeling/analysis, commissioning and similar fact finding surveys of the site in order to provide reports of existing conditions on which to base proper design; and similar services not involved in the preparation of designs, plans, drawings, and specifications.

b.	Title I (Type "B") Services:  The A/E shall perform those items normally furnished by an A/E in the actual preparation of the design documents (plans, drawings, estimates, specifications, submittal register, Comprehensive Interior Design, etc.) in the Schematic, Design Development and Construction Document phases.  The A/E shall perform all work required to produce documents describing the work required to accomplish the project as specifically identified in each Task Order (TO).  Unless otherwise specifically provided therein, the A/E shall perform these services as follows.

1)	Field Survey and Investigation:  The A/E shall visually inspect the site and/or facility for familiarization with the scope of work and general conditions of the facility.  Coordinate with the using activities to obtain their operational activities for the development of functional relationships and detailed requirements.  The A/E shall visit the project site for investigation of the existing physical conditions and to ensure the accuracy of the drawings, as available, furnished to the A/E by the Government.

2)	Cost Estimates:  The A/E shall design each project to provide a complete and usable facility within a given target construction cost provided by the Government.  The target construction cost will be provided to the contractor in our requests for proposal and on the executed contractual document, the Standard Form 252.  The A/E cost estimates shall be based on labor and material prices prevailing in the project's locality.  Cost estimates shall be descriptive, detailed, and includes all operations of work required including quantities and unit costs.  Additionally the construction cost estimate shall include Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and contractor furnished equipment when applicable.  The A/E cost estimate shall summarize all cost by material, labor, other direct costs, overhead, profit, and bonding costs.  Cost estimates shall be prepared on an electronic version of the VA Form 08-6277, RS Means Standard Excel Format or CO pre-approved A/E equivalent electronic spreadsheet that provides the information specified above.

3)	Project Costs:  The A/E shall be required to conduct the field survey and investigations, prepare the preliminary drawings, data, reports, etc., and design the full scope of the work as outlined above and as agreed upon during review of study data and recommendations.  If the estimated costs exceeds the amount indicated on the project description sheets for each project (based on current anticipated scope and subject to adjustment to approved scope), sufficient alternates to the construction contract should be determined at the time of the preliminary review conference to reduce the cost below this amount, if deemed necessary by the Government.  Cost estimates, and computation sheets prepared by the A/E shall be marked "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY".

4)	Phasing Plans, Impact Mitigation, and Energy.  Construction work will be in occupied Medical Centers and every effort will be made to interface construction with Medical Center operations. To minimize impact this means the preparation of detailed phasing plans including associated moves.  Phasing plans will show exact areas of work along with specific outage times, infection control risk assessment (ICRA) mitigation measures (including specific dust, noise, debris control), interim life safety measures (ILSM) which provide for specific measures to mitigate any reduction in fire protection features (i.e., exits out of service, fire sprinkler removal, etc).  Utility outages will be carefully planned and included it the contract in order to allow all OSHA required safety measures to be maintained while continuing Medical Center operations.  (For example, outages must provide means to shut off and lock out / tag out equipment while still allowing for Medical Center to continue operations).  Project must meet all legal requirements and executive orders including EPAC 2005, EISA 2007, EO 13514, and EO13423 all dealing with environmental, energy, and water as specifically applied to Federal Buildings.

3.  STATEMENT OF SERVICES:  The A/E shall perform all or part of the following services as more specifically identified in each delivery order.

a.	Title I (Type "A" Services).  The A/E shall perform all work required to investigate existing conditions (Pre-Design).  This work includes field investigations and surveys (topographic, geotechnical, chemical, site utilities, existing mechanical etc.), energy modeling/analysis, commissioning and similar fact finding surveys of the site in order to provide reports of existing conditions on which to base proper design; and similar services not involved in the preparation of designs, plans, drawings, and specifications.

b.	Title I (Type "B") Services:  The A/E shall perform those items normally furnished by an A/E in the actual preparation of the design documents (plans, drawings, estimates, specifications, submittal register, Comprehensive Interior Design, etc.) in the Schematic, Design Development and Construction Document phases.  The A/E shall perform all work required to produce documents describing the work required to accomplish the project as specifically identified in each Task Order (TO).  Unless otherwise specifically provided therein, the A/E shall perform these services as follows.

1)	Field Survey and Investigation:  The A/E shall visually inspect the site and/or facility for familiarization with the scope of work and general conditions of the facility.  Coordinate with the using activities to obtain their operational activities for the development of functional relationships and detailed requirements.  The A/E shall visit the project site for investigation of the existing physical conditions and to ensure the accuracy of the drawings, as available, furnished to the A/E by the Government.

2)	Cost Estimates:  The A/E shall design each project to provide a complete and usable facility within a given target construction cost provided by the Government.  The target construction cost will be provided to the contractor in our requests for proposal and on the executed contractual document, the Standard Form 252.  The A/E cost estimates shall be based on labor and material prices prevailing in the project's locality.  Cost estimates shall be descriptive, detailed, and includes all operations of work required including quantities and unit costs.  Additionally the construction cost estimate shall include Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and contractor furnished equipment when applicable.  The A/E cost estimate shall summarize all cost by material, labor, other direct costs, overhead, profit, and bonding costs.  Cost estimates shall be prepared on an electronic version of the VA Form 08-6277, RS Means Standard Excel Format or CO pre-approved A/E equivalent electronic spreadsheet that provides the information specified above.

3)	Project Costs:  The A/E shall be required to conduct the field survey and investigations, prepare the preliminary drawings, data, reports, etc., and design the full scope of the work as outlined above and as agreed upon during review of study data and recommendations.  If the estimated costs exceeds the amount indicated on the project description sheets for each project (based on current anticipated scope and subject to adjustment to approved scope), sufficient alternates to the construction contract should be determined at the time of the preliminary review conference to reduce the cost below this amount, if deemed necessary by the Government.  Cost estimates, and computation sheets prepared by the A/E shall be marked "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY".

4)	Phasing Plans, Impact Mitigation, and Energy.  Construction work will be in occupied Medical Centers and every effort will be made to interface construction with Medical Center operations. To minimize impact this means the preparation of detailed phasing plans including associated moves.  Phasing plans will show exact areas of work along with specific outage times, infection control risk assessment (ICRA) mitigation measures (including specific dust, noise, debris control), interim life safety measures (ILSM) which provide for specific measures to mitigate any reduction in fire protection features (i.e., exits out of service, fire sprinkler removal, etc).  Utility outages will be carefully planned and included it the contract in order to allow all OSHA required safety measures to be maintained while continuing Medical Center operations.  (For example, outages must provide means to shut off and lock out / tag out equipment while still allowing for Medical Center to continue operations).  Project must meet all legal requirements and executive orders including EPAC 2005, EISA 2007, EO 13514, and EO13423 all dealing with environmental, energy, and water as specifically applied to Federal Buildings.  This requires up front analysis and planning.  This indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract will be for one basic period of year (12 months), with 4 option years (12 months each).

3.  STATEMENT OF SERVICES:  The A/E shall perform all or part of the following services as more specifically identified in each delivery order.

a.	Title I (Type "A" Services).  The A/E shall perform all work required to investigate existing conditions (Pre-Design).  This work includes field investigations and surveys (topographic, geotechnical, chemical, site utilities, existing mechanical etc.), energy modeling/analysis, commissioning and similar fact finding surveys of the site in order to provide reports of existing conditions on which to base proper design; and similar services not involved in the preparation of designs, plans, drawings, and specifications.

b.	Title I (Type "B") Services:  The A/E shall perform those items normally furnished by an A/E in the actual preparation of the design documents (plans, drawings, estimates, specifications, submittal register, Comprehensive Interior Design, etc.) in the Schematic, Design Development and Construction Document phases.  The A/E shall perform all work required to produce documents describing the work required to accomplish the project as specifically identified in each Task Order (TO).  Unless otherwise specifically provided therein, the A/E shall perform these services as follows.

1)	Field Survey and Investigation:  The A/E shall visually inspect the site and/or facility for familiarization with the scope of work and general conditions of the facility.  Coordinate with the using activities to obtain their operational activities for the development of functional relationships and detailed requirements.  The A/E shall visit the project site for investigation of the existing physical conditions and to ensure the accuracy of the drawings, as available, furnished to the A/E by the Government.

2)	Cost Estimates:  The A/E shall design each project to provide a complete and usable facility within a given target construction cost provided by the Government.  The target construction cost will be provided to the contractor in our requests for proposal and on the executed contractual document, the Standard Form 252.  The A/E cost estimates shall be based on labor and material prices prevailing in the project's locality.  Cost estimates shall be descriptive, detailed, and includes all operations of work required including quantities and unit costs.  Additionally the construction cost estimate shall include Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and contractor furnished equipment when applicable.  The A/E cost estimate shall summarize all cost by material, labor, other direct costs, overhead, profit, and bonding costs.  Cost estimates shall be prepared on an electronic version of the VA Form 08-6277, RS Means Standard Excel Format or CO pre-approved A/E equivalent electronic spreadsheet that provides the information specified above.

3)	Project Costs:  The A/E shall be required to conduct the field survey and investigations, prepare the preliminary drawings, data, reports, etc., and design the full scope of the work as outlined above and as agreed upon during review of study data and recommendations.  If the estimated costs exceeds the amount indicated on the project description sheets for each project (based on current anticipated scope and subject to adjustment to approved scope), sufficient alternates to the construction contract should be determined at the time of the preliminary review conference to reduce the cost below this amount, if deemed necessary by the Government.  Cost estimates, and computation sheets prepared by the A/E shall be marked "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY".

4)	Phasing Plans, Impact Mitigation, and Energy.  Construction work will be in occupied Medical Centers and every effort will be made to interface construction with Medical Center operations. To minimize impact this means the preparation of detailed phasing plans including associated moves.  Phasing plans will show exact areas of work along with specific outage times, infection control risk assessment (ICRA) mitigation measures (including specific dust, noise, debris control), interim life safety measures (ILSM) which provide for specific measures to mitigate any reduction in fire protection features (i.e., exits out of service, fire sprinkler removal, etc).  Utility outages will be carefully planned and included it the contract in order to allow all OSHA required safety measures to be maintained while continuing Medical Center operations.  (For example, outages must provide means to shut off and lock out / tag out equipment while still allowing for Medical Center to continue operations).  Project must meet all legal requirements and executive orders including EPAC 2005, EISA 2007, EO 13514, and EO13423 all dealing with environmental, energy, and water as specifically applied to Federal Buildings.  This requires up front analysis and planning.  This indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract will be for one basic period of year (12 months), with 4 option years (12 months each).

c. The A/E shall document that any alternatives to Class I substances or Class II substances, which the A/E specifies, requires, or in any way incorporates into a design document, are identified within USEPA's "Significant New Alternatives Policy Program" as an "acceptable substitute."  The acceptable substitutes are identified on EPA's website at: http://www.epa.gov/ozone/snap/index.html. 

e.  State-specific ODS Air Permitting Requirements - depending on state implementation of federal Clean Air Act (i.e., Colorado, Wyoming, Montana and Utah) the A/E shall determine whether an air pollution emission notice (APEN) or air permit is required before initiating procurement/testing/operation of a new or replacement CFC/HCFC charged chiller system at a VISN 19 medical facility.

26.  STORMWATER, SOIL, AND EROSION CONTROL:  The A/E shall include in the design soil and erosion control measures in accordance with local jurisdictions as required by that specific locations laws and shall provide the following in terms of storm water, soil, and erosion control for all projects:

a. The definition of disturbed area on a project includes all areas disturbed, including lay down and staging areas, site access, etc, not just the project site footprint.

b. For projects disturbing greater than 5000 sf but less than 1 acre, develop a stand-alone soil and erosion control plan.

c. For projects disturbing greater than one acre develop a stand-alone soil and erosion control plan and have it approved by the applicable local authoritative governments as required by local and/or state authority.  

d. The A/E shall include the calculation of project area used to determine soil and erosion control requirement in the design analysis.  The A/E shall be responsible for any "processing" and "expediting", etc. fees.  The design will not be considered complete until the approved plan and approval documentation are provided to the Government.  Three copies of each shall be submitted as part of the 100 percent submittal. 

27.  ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITING:  The A/E is required to evaluate the need and identify all environmental permits for construction.  The following are examples of environmental permits; the requirement is not limited to these.  If work is within 50 ft of the tributary boundary that runs along the installation boundary, a GP-3 permit must be obtained. If any new air emissions source, the requirement for an air permit must be evaluated and obtained when necessary.  For any "like-like replacement" project with an existing emissions source (e.g., boilers, chiller units, etc.) the VISN 19 state-specific requirement (i.e., Colorado, Wyoming, Montana and Utah) for a Clean Air Act construction permit must be evaluated and obtained (if needed), as well.

28.  SUBMITTAL FOR A/E COST PROPOSALS:  For each TO, the A/E shall submit a proposal using VA Form 10-6298 available from the CO or at http://www.va.gov/vaforms/medical/pdf/vha-10-6298.pdf.  Each item in the form shall be complete.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT- National Guard Bureau, United States Property and Fiscal Office for Oregon (USPFO for Oregon), intends to solicit and award a sole source contract to Avion Manufacturing Inc, 75 Cooperative Way Wright City, MO 63390 to purchase AV-500-0001-6 USBF Electronics Subsystem (system 2007). This system is a specific upgrade to an existing Avion Blade Balancer used currently on the CH-47D Helicopters.  The AV-500-0001-6 USBF Electronics Subsystem (system 2007) is used in conjunction with the Track and Balance Equipment. Only this upgrade will satisfy the safety and maintenance requirements outlined by the CH-47D maintenance manual. An upgrade to the existing system owned by the Oregon Army National Guard is more cost effective than to procure a new blade balancer system. This vendor is the sole manufacturer and distributer of this system upgrade and its accessories in the United States.  <br>  <br> This sole source requirement meets the conditions of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1); only one responsible source has been identified as reasonably available to provide the supplies that will satisfy the agency requirements. Avion Manufacturing Inc. is the only known source that can provide this upgrade to current equipment. Information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids, quotes, or proposals. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 488190 and the Small Business size standard is $30 Million based on the U.S. Small Business Administration. This will be a firm fixed price contract. The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This synopsis does not constitute a solicitation, however all responsible sources that believe they can meet all of the requirements may contact the USPFO for Oregon via e-mail at nicollette.a.kennemer.mil@mail.mil and be considered by the government. If no responses are received by 4:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time, 1 April 2013, a Sole Source contract will be pursued with Avion Manufacturing Inc. <br>  <br> Contracting Office Address:  <br> USPFO for Oregon <br> PO Box 14350 <br> Salem, Oregon 97309 <br>  <br> Place of Delivery:  <br> Pendleton, Oregon <br>  <br> Contractor:  <br> Avion Manufacturing Inc.  <br> 75 Cooperative Way <br> Wright City, MO 63390 <br>

<DESC>The goal of the broader Partnership for Growth (PFG) bilateral engagement is to shift the Philippines from a low growth path to a higher, sustained and more inclusive growth on par with other high-performing emerging economies.  The COMPETE Project is intended to contribute to higher growth through the better provision of infrastructure, increased competitiveness of key industries, and increased access to credit. USAID will support measures that lower transport and logistics costs, reduce the cost of electricity, and promote the expansion of businesses in the priority sectors identified in the Philippine Development Plan, primarily in tourism and agribusiness.  To fulfill this goal, COMPETE will promote increased trade and investment through three approaches:  through the better provision of infrastructure, increased competitiveness of key industries, and increased access to credit. COMPETE will support the Government of the Philippines (GPH) efforts and the development of private sector enterprises with the view of enhancing national and industrial competitiveness.
<p>The award is a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee Completion Type Contract.</p>

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 2, Bath VA Medical Center located at 76 Veterans Avenue, Bath, NY  14810, has submitted Procurement Request 528-13-2-6307-0264.
 

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  This is a request for Other Than Full and Open Competition for the procurement of STAT Lab Specimen Testing services from Ira Davenport Memorial Hospital, located at 7571 New York 54, Bath, NY 14810. 

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  The Bath VA Medical Center, in order to continue to provide emergency and acute care services, requires a service contract with a community partner hospital to provide stat laboratory specimen testing in the event of analyzer equipment failure or critical staffing shortages at the Bath VA Medical Center. 

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  41 USC 253(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.

	(X)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   The nature of this acquisition is such that the rural nature of the Bath VA Medical Center makes it geographically impossible to contract with another community hospital in the area to provide this service within the timeframes that we require. STAT Lab Specimen Testing is critical to eligible Veteran beneficiary patient care.
 

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable: In this situation, solicitation from other sources is impractical as there are no other available services on a 24 hour, 365 day per year basis in the immediate geographical area.  

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The anticipated price to the Government for STAT Lab Specimen Testing covering the period March 1, 2013 through February 28, 2014 is $20,000.00. Price is determined reasonable by the contracting officer based on historical pricing paid by Bath VA to Ira Davenport Memorial Hospital in addition to an established price schedule reflecting Medicare rates plus 10 percent.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Market research performed is included herewith.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition: None  
 
10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  None


11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  In this case, barriers to competition cannot be overcome for the reasons described in 5 and 6 above. 


12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

URS has the requisite experience and personnel to continue to provide support to Government aircraft, both rotary and fixed wing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Only URS possess the tools, processes and equipment necessary to immediately provide the required services. This effort is a consistent extension of the work performed under previous and current government contract for CFA maintenance and modifications, listed under paragraph 10a.&nbsp;&nbsp;No other service provider can perform the extensive task and air platform integration/ testing necessary to be able to provide the capability required in a timely manner.&nbsp;</span></div>
