<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service operates a nationwide program to investigate and clean up contamination on National Forest System (“NFS”) land, primarily abandoned hard rock mining sites.  Forest Service activities under this program, which include enforcement actions against parties responsible for the contamination, are authorized pursuant to Executive Order 12580 and the Federal “Superfund” law, formally known as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 9601 et seq. (“CERCLA”).  

As part of its enforcement activities under CERCLA, the Forest Service frequently identifies responsible parties (commonly referred to as “Potentially Responsible Parties” or “PRPs”) that are either defunct or otherwise have a financial inability to pay their fair share of site response costs.  The existence of these financially nonviable PRPs often undermines the Government’s ability to obtain the funds needed for an effective response at these contaminated sites.  

However, the Forest Services believes that some of these now-defunct PRPs had purchased comprehensive general liability or similar insurance policies in the past that could now be used to help pay for site response costs.  Consequently, the Forest Service is seeking the assistance of a contractor experienced in the recovery of insurance proceeds for environmental cleanup costs to assist it in identifying a limited number of candidate sites and pursuing cost-recovery negotiations with the insurance companies that sold these policies (or their successors in interest).  This work, which is expected to cover a one-year “test” period, will not involve any litigation on behalf of the Government.  Thus, the Department seeks to acquire expert insurance consulting support for a one-year period with a possible one-year option period to assist the Forest Service in identifying suitable candidate sites, reviewing potentially applicable insurance policies, and assisting in cost-recovery negotiations with relevant insurance carriers.  

The scope of work does not include any litigation.  The contractor may be an attorney, however, the contractor will not have the authority to make any decisions, nor to assert claims or conduct litigation, on behalf of the Forest Service or USDA.  The contractor will only function in an advisory capacity to assist the decision-making by the Forest Service, the USDA Office of the General Counsel, and the Department.  

The contractor will provide services on a contingent-fee basis.  The amount of payment made to the contractor will be calculated solely as a fixed percentage of the amount recovered by the Forest Service from any insurance carrier.  The contractor will not be reimbursed by the Forest Service or USDA for any of its out-of-pocket or other costs or expenses related to this work.  


The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code  541618 has a size standard of $6.5 Million. The solicitation is expected to be available on or before March 15, 2006, and will close 30 days thereafter.  The solicitation will be available and distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunity website at http://www.fbo.gov; the site provides downloading instructions.  All future information regarding this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be available and distributed soley through the web site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.  The Government will evaluate proposals using source selection procedures with the intent to award a firm-fixed (contingent fee) contract to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation as the BEST VALUE to the Government. The Government requires offerors to submit a technical proposal.  Each proposal shall contain the offerors' best technical response and best offer.  OFFERORS ARE ADVISED THAT THE GOVERNMENT MAY MAKE AN AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  ALL QUESTIONS REGARDING THE SOLICITATION MUST BE SUBMITTED IN WRITING TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER VIA MAIL SERVICE, E-MAIL OR FAX.  THE RESPONSIBLE PROCURING OFFICE WILL NOT ACCEPT TELEPHONE INQUIRIES OR REQUESTS.  PROPOSALS MUST BE SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY BY THE SPECIFIED CLOSING DATE.

Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101: An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.

Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.  Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.  Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).  If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R.

The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.  Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements.  Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The Pharmaceutical Resources Branch, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), National Cancer Institute (NCI) is seeking offerors for the purpose of procurement of bulk chemicals and drugs that are needed by the Drug Treatment Programs (DTP) for preclinical and clinical use. Assigned compounds are not readily available in the quality or quantities required from the original source, other suppliers or the open market. The compounds could be known or new chemicals with a wide variety of chemical structures. Multi-step preparation sequences will generally be involved and process development for scale-up preparation will be expected using provided investigator’s procedures. The quantity of a given material synthesized may range from multi-grams to multi-kilograms.  All materials prepared will be fully characterized for high purity and the preparative cost will also be calculated. Most of assigned projects should be performed under the current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) complied with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rule and regulations. The following MANDATORY QUALIFICATION CRITERIA must be met at the time of receipt of initial proposals by the Contracting Officer in order to be considered for award:  (A) All offerors shall be registered with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a manufacturer of bulk drugs; and (B) The facilities shall conform to the applicable regulations of the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), and those of state and local regulatory agencies.

All chemicals handled during the project should be considered to be potentially hazardous and/or toxic and, thus, should be handled accordingly. Offerors will be instructed to describe their safety program and their proposed approach for the handling of hazardous and toxic agents.  Submission of safety manuals will be required. In addition, offerors must have facilities to handle cytotoxic agents because most projects involve preparation of potentially carcinogenic compounds (e.g., adequate air-handling system).

Multiple awards of cost reimbursement, incrementally funded completion type contracts are anticipated. The contracts will be competed and awarded at two levels, Level I and Level II. Level I awardees are expected to complete 8 to 12 deliveries each year excluding reports and Level II awardees are expected to complete 15 to 25 deliveries each year excluding reports. Monthly progress reports describing work performed and annual project reports will be submitted, but additional reports may be required. Laboratory notebooks containing raw data should be maintained at the contract site for reviewing at the discretion of the Government. Prepared compounds are shipped to the NCI or the NCI repositories along with data sheets.  Synthetic procedures and cost information should also be submitted for each compound when available.

It is anticipated that resulting awards will be made for a five year base period with two option years.  

The solicitation is scheduled for release approximately December 2, 2005. Proposals will be due 45 days following the actual date of RFP issuance.  This is a 100% small business set-aside under the NAICS Code No. 54171 and a size standard of 500 employees.  (See Number Note 1.)  The RFP may be accessed through the Research Contracts Branch home page by using the following Internet address:  http:/rcb.nci.nih.gov/rfp.htm. It is the offeror’s responsibility to monitor the above internet site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.  Point of contact is Diane H. Stalder; electronic mail address ds88b@nih.gov/; phone 301-435-3822; and fax 301-402-6699.  NO COLLECT CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.

<DESC>The National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, on behalf of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Alabama at Birmingham to extend and expand the scope of their current contract for an additional five years. The University of Alabama at Birmingham was originally awarded a contract for a five year period in September 2000 for a project entitled "Consortium for the Longitudinal Evaluation of African-Americans with Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (CLEAR) Registry." The purpose of this contract is to establish a registry (CLEAR) which serves to identify genetic and non-genetic prognostic factors of disease outcome using radiographic presence of bony erosions as the primary outcome measure (at 3 years disease duration).  The registry (400 completers) will serve as the basis for prospective analyses of factors predictive of the clinical phenotype and outcomes.  Four major academic medical centers in the southeast U.S. will gather data which will provide a resource for investigators interested in the genetics of RA in African Americans.  The Contractor will continue to 1) complete longitudinal evaluation of 400 African-Americans with early RA and 200 matched controls; 2) complete the 3 and 5 year disease duration visits; 3) enroll an additional 600 African-American subjects with RA and an additional 300 matched controls; 4) establish a cross-sectional cohort of 600 subjects; 5) collect clinical, demographic, and socioeconomic information; 6) obtain radiographs of the hands and feet at entry into the study; and 7) collect blood for serum, genomic DNA, and RNA suitable for microarrays.  Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302 1, University of Alabama at Birmingham is the only source capable of performing this requirement due to their prerequisite knowledge and experience because of their preliminary and current work. Due to the inherent duplication of cost and unacceptable delays in performance, a noncompetitive procurement is in the best interest of the Government.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements, as described above.  A determination not to compete the proposed work based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. This notice of intent is not an announcement of the availability of a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is a RFP available. See Numbered Note 22.

<SUBJECT>A -- Collaborative Network for Clinical Research on Immune Tolerance
<SOLNBR>NIH-NIAID-DAIT-07-33
<RESPDATE>013006
<CONTACT>Deborah Blyveis, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-594-7211, Fax 301-480-4675, Email blyveisd@niaid.nih.gov - Erin Goldstein, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-496-6423, Fax 301-402-0972, Email EG108r@nih.gov
<DESC>The NIAID supports a broad range of basic, translational, and clinical research on the underlying mechanisms of immune tolerance, and the evaluation of tolerance induction strategies in animal models and in clinical trials.  Tolerance induction strategies aim to selectively block or prevent deleterious immune responses, while leaving protective immunity intact.  The successful induction of immune tolerance to treat and prevent immune-mediated disorders is a major goal of these efforts.  Advances in tolerance induction will provide valuable new therapeutic strategies that will not require life-long, systemic immunosuppressive therapy with its deleterious side effects.  For example, in transplantation, donor-specific immune tolerance - a selective blockade of immune responses directed against the graft - would enable long-term graft survival without the complications and risks of systemic immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., infection, malignancy, and atherosclerosis).  In asthma and allergic diseases, the goal of tolerance research is to develop methods to prevent immune responses to allergens, such as cockroach and house dust mite, that cause or exacerbate these diseases.  In autoimmune diseases, researchers are developing novel approaches to block the immune responses that cause the body to mistakenly attack its own organs, tissues, or cells. 
The purpose of this solicitation is to recompete the “Collaborative Network for Clinical Research on Immune Tolerance,” first awarded in 1999, and to expand the required work to include nonclinical research and product development, bioinformatics, and data collection, validation, and analysis.  One award is expected to be made in response to this solicitation.  The NIAID recognizes that no single organization or institution may have the expertise and facilities required to perform all requirements set forth in the Statement of Work; consequently, the Contractor may need to utilize the expertise and services of subcontractors to perform the tasks required.  The Contractor shall be responsible for all work performed under this contract, including that performed by subcontractors.

The scope of work to be performed by the Network includes:

•	The design and conduct of Phase I-IV clinical trials of  investigational approaches intended to lead to a functional state of immune tolerance;

•	The design and conduct of mechanistic studies and the development of tolerance assays as integral components of these clinical trials; 

•	Focused product development and nonclinical studies (e.g., toxicology, pharmacology, and pharmacokinetics, etc.) essential for the subsequent evaluation of experimental tolerance induction therapies in humans; and

•	The provision of bioinformatics, data management and analysis resources.  

In addition to the tasks outlined above to be provided for in the basic requirement,  Options may be exercised, at the discretion of the Government, for additional tasks including:

•	Nonclinical research and product development
•	Clinical trials
•	Mechanistic studies
•	Bioinformatics support

The Network will require strong leadership to provide for the overall scientific direction, coordination and management of complex research studies involving a large number of geographically distributed facilities, subcontractors, and Network personnel.  The Network will also establish collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, other NIH sponsored clinical research programs, and private research organizations to identify and evaluate tolerance induction therapies, conduct mechanistic studies, and perform assays to assess the induction, maintenance, and loss of tolerance.

It is anticipated that one seven year cost-reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded, beginning approximately February 1, 2007.  

Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government.  RFP-NIH-NIAID-DAIT-07-33 will be available electronically on or about January 30, 2006 with a closing date tentatively set for June 5, 2006.   The RFP may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Program (CMP) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract and on FedBizOpps web site located at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ . 

This notice is for information and planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future.   This is not a request for proposals.  The Government does not intend to award a contract based on responses under this announcement.   No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst NJ intends to enter into negotiations on a non-competitive basis with Pacific Power Source, Irvine CA for upgraded  Auxiliary Power Units (APUs) of the High Power Device Test Subsystem (HPDTS) resulting from incorporation of an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP).  The HPDTS consists of two additional racks to the Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS).  The HPDTS is the Navy’s newest aircraft radar and electronic warfare automatic test support equipment used afloat on CV/CVN and L-Class aircraft carriers, U.S. Marine Corps and Navy Mobile Facilities (MOFACs) and ashore Aircraft Intermediate Maintenance Facilities (AIMDs).  The AN/ALQ-99 is a tactical jamming system on the EA-6B aircraft. The High Power Device Test Subsystem (HPDTS) and the ALQ-99 Operational Test Program Set (OTPS) are used to test the AN/ALQ-99.  The incorporation of the ECP will allow the APU to fully support diagnostic testing and maintenance of the AN/ALQ-99 Transmitters. There are currently fourteen (14) different configurations of the AN/ALQ-99 Transmitter.  It is intended that the engineering change be incorporated into a quantity of up to 140 HPDTS APUs, P/N 3528AS120-01. Modification of the APU will satisfy full power requirements and extends capability of the existing HPDTS to perform full diagnostic test support of AN/ALQ-99 Low Band Transmitters (LBT) through Band 10.  The Government intends to procure the upgraded APUs under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1.  The Government does not own or control the technical data or other specifications for the commercially produced APU to permit full and open competition for the incorporation of the required changes to the APU.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government will consider all responses received within fifteen days after the date of publication of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received as a result of this notice will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory (MEL), has a requirement for a Pontoon Boat for NIST Underwater Sensors Testbed.

The testbed must emulate behavior of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and also be used to test underwater sensors that would be used to control AUVs.  The strategy is to 
use a pontoon boat, and robot manipulator that controls motions of a sensor platform underwater.  The pontoon boat’s motion will supply forward motion through the water, and  the robot manipulator will control the underwater platform’s depth, orientation, and small scale motions.   
	
NIST personnel will use the boat for conducting in-the-water experiments with sensors and testing control strategies for AUVs.  NIST will test and develop the new technology on the testbed and then transfer it to free swimming AUVs.  The testbed will be a boat, with Stewart platform robot (StPR) attached, along with underwater sensors, controllers, actuators, and operator interfaces for viewing status and controlling tests.  The Stewart platform robot consists of 6 winches above the water, a lower underwater platform, outrigger arms, and cables that connect them.  

Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION.

This requirement is being procured using simplified acquisition procedures under the authority of FAR Part 13, via full & open competition.

The NAICS code for this requirement is 336612 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.

The competitive Request for Quotation (RFQ), specifications, any subsequent amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFQ number SB1341-06-Q-0228.

The RFQ is anticipated for release to the vendor community on or about February 28, 2006, and will only be available via the Internet at the above web site.

Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the web site.  Interested parties must respond to the RFQ in order to be considered for award of any resultant purchase order.   No written solicitation document is available, telephone requests shall not be honored, and no bidders list shall be maintained.  Potential offerors are requested to direct all questions via e-mail to Carol.Wood@NIST.Gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<RESPDATE>030306
<CONTACT>Cindy Hische, 609-485-6288
<DESC>The William J. Hughes Technical Center is performing a market survey to seek sources for a potential contract.  At a minimum, the contractor must have ten years of the experience described below.  If you feel that your company can meet these qualifications, please mail your capability statement to:  FAA, knowledge of the work performed by SC-159, WG-4 from both a historical perspective and the status of the LAAS MASPS, MOPS, and ICD is mandatory. Also, a complete understanding of the recent changes to the MOPS and ICD and the subsequent affect to the LGF Specification, FAA-E-2937A, is critical. 2. The ability to understand and articulate the flow-down of requirements from the LAAS MASPS to the LGF specification, RTCA MOPS, and ICD is critical.  This includes how allocations are made between the H0 and H1 Hypothesis stated in the MASPS and the allocation to ranging source faults, as found in the FAA-E-2937A.     3. The ability to relate MASPS, MOPS, ICD and LGF specification to ICAO Annex 10 SARPs is critical. 4. The ability to perform trade-off analysis in integrity and continuity requirements is critical. 5. An in-depth understanding of the FAA LAAS operational requirements and how they pertain to the flow-down of requirements to the LGF specification to support analysis of system safety, availability/reliability, continuity, and time-to-alarm.  6. The ability to evaluate manufacturers' proposed integrity algorithms and designs based on a working knowledge of the requirements is critical. 7. The ability to analyze the various integrity monitors identified for LAAS and address issues related to missed detection and prior probabilities as they apply to ranging source failures.   EDITED:    This is to clarify that it would create a conflict with any company that wishes to sell/market the same technology and they are (to reemphasize) going to be required to evaluate other manfuacturers' integrity algorithms, continuity analysis, etc., for the purposes of aiding the government in making decisions (including possibly traditional contract milestones such as PDR, CDR, etc., not to mention that any possible award will only be for part-time work of one senior level engineer who specializes in this specifically and possible part-time work of a junior level person.)  William J. Hughes Technical Center, ATTN:  ACX-51 (Cindy Hische), Atlantic City International Airport, Atlantic City, New Jersey  08405.  You also may e-mail this information to cynthia.hische@faa.gov.  No telephonic information will be given and no information will be given by the requiring activity.

<RESPDATE>022406
<ARCHDATE>03242006
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Scott Fogle, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2049
<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   Amendment #1 The purpose of this amendment is to answer technical questions received, and extend the due date and time of the order to Friday February 24, 2006 at 12:00PM (EST).   Technical Questions Question #1:   What is the composition of the sample?  Are they  mineral deposits with carbon and sulfur in them?  Solids?  What is the anticipated 'normal' range for carbon and sulfur?   Answer #1:   The samples are a variety of solid materials obtained from water distribution system pipes and tanks, drinking water and hydrant-flush particulates, and  soils/sediments from reservoirs and watersheds, that comprise drinking water sources.  The composition of solids covers a wide range, depending on the nature of the source.  They are mainly carbonates, hydroxides and oxides, but may also be silicates and phosphates, and all mixtures in between.   The major element is usually iron, lead or copper, usually from 25% to 85% by weight.  Inorganic Carbon is likely from 0 to 15%, usually 0 to 5%.  Organic Carbon is likely from 0 to 5%, usually 0 to 3%.  Sulfur is likely from 0 to 10%.  Little work has been done in this area for Sulfur, so the  usual percentage is unknown. Other elements present, in abundance of greater than 1%, include Ca, Mg, Mn, Si, P, and Al, but others could be present.   A typical sample volume available for this analysis (C and S on a single sample), is 0.05 to 0.15 gram. Question #2:  If there is the possibility  that the samples could be analyzed by one analyzer, it would certainly be in the EPA's best interest to determine this prior to buying a multi-furnace instrument, which the bid indicates. Answer #2:  The specification is for one instrument system that will analyze total S (TS) and total C (TC) on  the same sample.  The EPA currently has other instrumentation that determines total Inorganic C.   The EPA's sample size is very limited, and both (TC and TS) accurate determinations must be possible on a total sample volume of no more than 0.15 gram.  Smaller sample volumes would be  advantageous. This is a request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The identifying RFQ number is RFQ-OH-06-00070.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are  those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-08.   A firm fixed price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this RFQ.  Shipping charges need to be included in price.  The NAICS code is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.   1.0 Background The EPA has the  need for elemental analysis of total carbon (TC) and total sulfur (TS) in small quantities of solid materials from water treatment and water distribution system research projects. The solid materials are most often corrosion or scale deposits on drinking water pipes, particularly lead, copper and  iron. The amount of material available for all chemical analyses is normally less than 0.50 g, of which, at maximum about 0.1 to 0.2 g can be spared for a combined TC/TS determination. 2.0 Instrument Specifications 1.  Must be capable of analyzing both  organic and inorganic samples 2.  Must  contain an induction furnace unit, with a pneumatic sample introduction system 3.  Must contain an automatic furnace cleaning cycle after each analysis 4.  Must contain a resistance furnace which utilizes heating elements that heat up to full temperature (minimum of 1500? C) in approximately 10 min  or less, to facilitate sample throughput 5.  Must include a computer, interfaced balance (4th place), operating software, on-site training for 3 staff, and operating supplies up to 1000 analyses 6.  Must be cable of completing accurate analyses (within 5% relative) of C and S in samples, ranging  from 0 to 15% S or C by weight, using 0.2g or less sample 7.  Analysis time shall be less than 2 minutes per total analysis 8.  Must be capable of determining both S and C in the same analytical aliquot of sample 9.  Must include a voltage line regulator, oxygen regulator, pneumatic regulator, and  vacuum system operating on 120V 10.  Must be equipped with a supplemental package of accessories and parts to cover normal "emergency" repairs 11.  Must have enough supplies to enable 1000 sample analyses for both S and C. 3.0 Warranty The complete instrument, excluding expendable supplies, but  including the furnace, the sample introduction system and the balance, shall include a commercial warranty for not less than one year, parts and labor.   4.0 Delivery Date The instrument shall be delivered no later than 60 days after receipt of award.

The measurements of the existing skid are 34.75 (L) by 2 7.76 (W) by 8.50 (T).  The CERDEC Power Generation Branch is interested in obtaining White Papers, not exceeding 10 pages in length, describing the contractors experience in design, development, fabrication and test of composite materials, detailed information about the recomme nded materials and corresponding manufacturing processes, and a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) unit cost for potential future government procurements.

BEAKED WHALE TAGGING AND DIVE STUDIES IN HAWAII
STATEMENT OF WORK

I.  BACKGROUND
	Under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is required to periodically assess the status of marine mammal populations in waters under U.S. jurisdiction.  Population size and trends in population size are some of the most valuable data used for this purpose.  Large-scale ship surveys were conducted in 2002 around the Hawaiian Islands; however, there is no data on beaked whale diving in this area on which to base abundance correction factors.  
	In addition to general population assessment, NMFS has a mandate to monitor and mitigate human-caused impacts on marine mammal population.  Recently, the strandings of beaked whales has been associated with loud anthropogenic sounds, such as military sonars.  NMFS is working with the U.S. Navy to determine what factors are involved in causing these strandings.  Lack of knowledge about the normal diving behavior of beaked whales is an impediment to understanding the cause of strandings.
	The intent of this contract is to improve information beaked whale diving behavior, near-shore distribution, and population structure around the Hawaiian Islands.  The contract is organized into an initial one-year project and one optional year of additional work.

II. TASKS
	The contractor will conduct studies of the diving behavior of beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris and/or Mesoplodon sp.) in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands between 1 Jan 2006 and 1 Nov 2006.  This will include collecting information on the distribution of dive times, dive depths, and surface times collected using recording tags attached to the animals.  Work is expected to be done from small boats (to be provided by the contractor).   Analyses should include cumulative distributions plots of time spent at each depth for each tagged individual.  In addition to studies of diving behavior of beaked whales, the contractor shall document all sightings of other marine mammals seen while conducting dive-behavior studies and shall obtain genetic samples (small tissue biopsies) from as many of these sightings as possible.  

	OPTION YEAR: Upon successful completion of the first year of field sampling, the Government may, at its discretion, choose to fund a second year of this work (between 1 Nov 2006 and 1 Nov 2007) to increase the sample size and collect additional data.  The contractor’s proposal should include a plan and budget for this option year.
	
III.  METHODOLOGIES
	The contractor will be allowed latitude to develop methods for radio/TDR tagging of beaked whales.  Biopsy samples will be taken by standard, accepted methods.  The contractor will be responsible for obtaining Marine Mammal Protection Act permits required for tagging activity as well as any permits that might be required by the State of Hawaii.

IV.  SPECIFICATIONS AND STANDARDS
 
	The estimates of population parameters from this contract will be used in evaluating threats to the population and may be used as evidence for taking management actions.  For these reasons, it is necessary that the research be scientifically credible.  The quality of the final reports should be equivalent to that of published articles in s

<CONTACT>DIANA ROMERO PURCHASING AGENT 3032369327     DLROMERO@USGS.GOV;
<DESC>DESCRIPTION This is not a notice for a solicitation. This is only a Request for Information (RFI).  The government does not intend to award a contract or any type of agreement on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicitated under this RFI.  This is NOT a request for proposal or an invitation to bid but merely a request for information. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is considering the feasibility of using a private sector application service provider (ASP) to host a centralized, secure, web-based utility that would selectively connect all USGS Water Science Centers (WSC) to any number of cooperating analytical laboratories.  There are approximately 50 WSCs located nationwide, typically one/state.  Such connectivity would permit WSCs to enter sample event information and simultaneously request required analytical services from cooperating laboratories.  During this initial, streamlined process, the application would assign a unique identifier to each sample that would be used by the USGS, its WSCs, and cooperating laboratories to track and manage all future activity related to the sample.  The general functionality of the process is summarized as follows. Initial session: 1a. A USGS WSC logs into the ASP web site and is immediately provided with records specific to its location. 2a. WSC personnel enter sample identification (ID) information using a short series of pull-down menus. 3a. WSC next uses a pull-down menu to select a cooperating laboratory where analytical tests will be performed. 4a. Tests and services available from the selected laboratory also are selected from pull-down menus.  WSCs can group laboratory tests together as "panels" or "schedules" and save them to streamline future analytical service request sessions. 5a. After laboratory test selection is complete, the application displays corresponding sample bottle type and sample preservative requirements. 6a. After the request has been completed, the ASP utility assigns a unique identification number (UID) that is used by the USGS, its WSCs, and cooperating laboratories to track and manage all future activity related to the sample. 7a. This UID is included on various printed forms and barcode labels that are affixed to sample containers at the USGS WSC. Later session: 1b. The WSC logs into the application.  UIDs for all 'in process' requests are listed and provide access previously entered records. 2b. Sampling-event information entry is completed-collection date and time, typically-and requested laboratory test requirements are compared with event samples collected; laboratory test requests can be revised if necessary. 3b. Once complete, the ASP utility sends a record of completed requests to the WSC and cooperating laboratory to be used in future sample management and data processing operations. Supporting information: a. A resident database for each USGS WSC (currently 50 WSC each having < 50 users) that contains user-specific records such as contact information, user code, account numbers, station identification numbers, and station names (currently <50 different fields, with most fields having <50 possible entries, and some fields having 100-1,000 possible entries).  The application would allow a USGS office to update and modify these records when necessary. b. A resident database that contains laboratory tests (< 1,000 different laboratory tests), bottle requirements (< 25 different bottle types), and preservation requirements (< 25 different preservation requirements).  There are < 200 possible laboratories to select. c. There are typically 40,000 requests per year. ASPs that believe they have the expertise and experience to meet this requirement with a Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) or turnkey product, may submit a response to this RFI.  A response should also include the following information: 1. A listing of any current or past federal government clients for the COTS including a technical and/or contracting officer point of contact. 2. An explanation of the basic fee assessment used by the ASP, i.e., a cost/transaction, etc. 3. A statement regarding the capability and ease of tailoring the ASP service to specific customer requirements 4. A statement identifying capability to provide services 24 hours a day, seven days a week, as well as, the capability to automatically switch over to an alternate site in case of unplanned interruptions in service. 5. A statement regarding compliance with the basic security measures, guidelines, or regulations the vendor's application meets or exceeds (for example, HIPAA for medical records and FISMA requirements associated with properly safeguarding USGS sensitive information). The response format should not exceed 10 pages inclusive of tables and figures.  Questions and all responses should be submitted to Diana Romero, the Contracting Officer, at dlromero@usgs.gov.  Responses are due on or before March 7, 2006.  Any subsequent solicitation will be synopsized prior to its release.

<DESC>BPA for Appraisals

The Natural Resources Conservation Service in Missouri is anticipating establishment of blanket purchase agreements for appraisals. These appraisals will be completed on land located throughout the state of Missouri that may be placed under a conservation easement through the Grassland Reserve Program (GRP) or the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP). The purpose of the appraisals is to provide an opinion of market value, as defined below, of the entire subject property (larger parcel) before acquisition of an easement (before value) and an opinion of market value of the entire subject property remaining after the proposed easement has been placed (after value) as of a current date of value. The appraiser shall recognize that in a before and after appraisal, the partial interest being acquired is not actually being appraised. What is appraised is the larger parcel before and after the conveyance of the partial interest.  

The purpose of two opinions of value is to establish the effect on value resulting from imposition of a conservation easement. The price of the easement is the before value of the entire property (larger parcel) minus the value of the entire property as encumbered a Conservation Warranty Easement Deed, after value, provided there are not adjustments such as excess irrigation water rights explained below, which would equal the price of the easement. A key concept in this appraisal process is defining the larger parcel is required to begin the appraisal process. The appraisals must be completed in compliance with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions and Supplemental Standards issued by NRCS. If you are interested in providing a quote for services, please contact the Contracting Officer at renee.gardner@mo.usda.gov for a copy of the BPA.

<DESC>The NIAID supports a broad range of basic, translational, and clinical research on the underlying mechanisms of immune tolerance, and the evaluation of tolerance induction strategies in animal models and in clinical trials.  Tolerance induction strategies aim to selectively block or prevent deleterious immune responses, while leaving protective immunity intact.  The successful induction of immune tolerance to treat and prevent immune-mediated disorders is a major goal of these efforts.  Advances in tolerance induction will provide valuable new therapeutic strategies that will not require life-long, systemic immunosuppressive therapy with its deleterious side effects.  For example, in transplantation, donor-specific immune tolerance - a selective blockade of immune responses directed against the graft - would enable long-term graft survival without the complications and risks of systemic immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., infection, malignancy, and atherosclerosis).  In asthma and allergic diseases, the goal of tolerance research is to develop methods to prevent immune responses to allergens, such as cockroach and house dust mite, that cause or exacerbate these diseases.  In autoimmune diseases, researchers are developing novel approaches to block the immune responses that cause the body to mistakenly attack its own organs, tissues, or cells. 
The purpose of this solicitation is to recompete the “Collaborative Network for Clinical Research on Immune Tolerance,” first awarded in 1999, and to expand the required work to include nonclinical research and product development, bioinformatics, and data collection, validation, and analysis.  One award is expected to be made in response to this solicitation.  The NIAID recognizes that no single organization or institution may have the expertise and facilities required to perform all requirements set forth in the Statement of Work; consequently, the Contractor may need to utilize the expertise and services of subcontractors to perform the tasks required.  The Contractor shall be responsible for all work performed under this contract, including that performed by subcontractors.

The scope of work to be performed by the Network includes:

•	The design and conduct of Phase I-IV clinical trials of  investigational approaches intended to lead to a functional state of immune tolerance;

•	The design and conduct of mechanistic studies and the development of tolerance assays as integral components of these clinical trials; 

•	Focused product development and nonclinical studies (e.g., toxicology, pharmacology, and pharmacokinetics, etc.) essential for the subsequent evaluation of experimental tolerance induction therapies in humans; and

•	The provision of bioinformatics, data management and analysis resources.  

The Network will require strong leadership to provide for the overall scientific direction, coordination and management of complex research studies involving a large number of geographically distributed facilities, subcontractors, and Network personnel.  The Network will also establish collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, other NIH sponsored clinical research programs, and private research organizations to identify and evaluate tolerance induction therapies, conduct mechanistic studies, and perform assays to assess the induction, maintenance, and loss of tolerance.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified small business sources and their size classifications (HUBZone 8(a), 8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-owned, Veteran-Owned, and Small Disadvantaged Business) relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate determinations about potential sources only. Businesses that are not considered small under the NAICS code should not submit responses to this sources sought synopsis. BACKGROUND: Homelessness in the U. S. continues to be a social problem as well as a major public health concern. Approximately 2.1 million adults and 1.3 million children experience homelessness in any given year (Burt, M.R., Aron, L.Y., Lee, E., & Valente, J. [2001]. Helping America’s homeless: Emergency Shelter or Affordable Housing?  Washington, DC: The Urban Institute Press). In 2004, the Council of Mayors reported that 23% of the requests for emergency shelter went unmet (NAEH, 2005). Individuals with serious mental illness and/or substance use disorders are at particularly high risk, experiencing homelessness more often and for longer periods than other subgroups. The individual and societal costs of homelessness are profound and demand targeted and informed strategies for preventing and ending homelessness. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) must continue to excel in its leadership role to assure the success of the Administration’s goal of ending chronic homelessness by 2012, especially for people with mental or substance use disorders.  SAMHSA is committed to ensuring the transformation goals of states’ mental health service systems are met. These goals, outlined in the Policy Academies’ (2003 through 2006) strategic planning process must be realized through the implementation of those 10-year plans. The Corporation for Supportive Housing said late last year, “It is crucial that the federal government ensure that these efforts [to end chronic homelessness by 2012] are coordinated with essential targeted federal programs, like McKinney-Vento grants, as well as ‘mainstream’ programs such as Section 8, CDBG, and safety net resources, including Medicaid.”  In order to continue to provide States and communities with innovative support and assistance, the Homeless Programs Branch (HPB), Division of Systems and Services Improvement (DSSI), Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), SAMHSA, will develop an innovative National Resource Center on Homelessness (NRCH). The NRCH will rely on technology and imaginative support services to promote the agenda of the States’ Strategic Plans to end Homelessness and to move those plans to the implementation stage. To do so will require an NRCH that is focused on working in collaboration with States to provide innovative solutions to barriers to the full implementation and realization of States’ Strategic goals and plans. The NRCH must spearhead the dissemination of best practices and policies through training and technical assistance issues not yet implemented in the field. The NRCH will also coordinate the synthesis of knowledge around emerging issues on Homelessness, putting together expert panels, developing of state-of-the-art policy papers, developing workforce-related curricula, training and manuals as the need arises. The NRCH is envisioned as a collaborative effort, putting together a consortium of experts, led by a steering committee made up of public, private and consumer entities, focused on providing States the assistance and energy they need to realize the implementation of the States’ ten (10)-year strategic plans and to provide the tools for successful realization of the goal of ending chronic homelessness in the next decade. CMHS’s HPB also serves as the lead within SAMHSA and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) for administering programs and interdepartmental initiatives that meet the treatment, support service, and housing needs of persons who are homeless with serious mental illnesses and/or co-occurring substance abuse disorders. The HPB has initiated a broad array of service delivery, knowledge development and application, technical assistance, and national leadership projects to assist States and localities in meeting the needs of this population. As part of the Fiscal Year 1991 reauthorization of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, the President signed legislation creating the Projects for Assistance in the Transition from Homelessness (PATH) formula grant program. The PATH program provides funds to each State, the District of Columbia, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealths of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Federal Territory of the Virgin Islands for the provision of services to individuals who have serious mental illnesses, or co-occurring serious mental illnesses and substance use disorders, and who are homeless or at imminent risk of becoming homeless (hereafter referred to as the “Client Population”). Eligible services to be provided under PATH include: outreach services; screening and diagnostic treatment services; habilitation and rehabilitation services; community mental health services; alcohol or drug treatment services; staff training; case management services; supportive and supervisory services in residential settings; referrals for primary health services, job training, and educational services; and relevant housing services. In addition, to improve coordination of services and housing for the target population, a limited set of housing services may be funded. Among the provisions of the PATH legislation is the requirement that the Secretary of DHHS, “…provide technical assistance to eligible entities in planning, developing, and operating programs...”. This initiative constitutes the implementation of this statutory requirement. “Eligible entities” in this instance are the 56 State and Territorial mental health authorities that receive formula grant funds under the program. Each State/Territory has designated a primary contact person responsible for operation of the PATH program. This person is referred to as the State PATH Contact. Overall, this initiative is intended to support the HPB by developing a National Resource Center on Homelessness and enhancing the quality of life for homeless people with mental illness and co-occurring substance abuse disorders by encouraging the field to provide housing, treatment and appropriate supportive services to maintain housing stability through the PATH program. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The focus of this procurement will be to: (1) Establish a National Resource Center on Homelessness (NRCH); (2) Assist the HPB in transforming existing systems of care to better address homelessness; (3) Create a learning community between stakeholders that will foster an environment of change and stimulate service system improvement; (4) Convene a Steering Committee made up of public, private and consumer-based representatives to draft a strategic plan for the first three years of the NRCH; (5) Propose innovative solutions to promote the 10-year strategic plans developed by the States during recent Policy Academies to end Chronic Homelessness and to ensure the successful implementation of those plans; (6) Update and maintain a national database of literature in the field; (7) Establish and maintain a toll-free “800” number for responding to information requests; (8) Maintain a website on homelessness; (9) Organize, provide logistic support and conduct annual PATH meetings and a biennial national training conference on homelessness; (10) Provide logistic support and implement workshops and trainings; (11) Provide technical assistance for services and systems improvement; (12) Develop training materials; (13) Develop curricula to support homeless services’ workforce (i.e., providing online credentialed coursework, obtaining SAMHSA clearances, as necessary, developing web enabled coursework, maintaining the site, providing web-trends data, and providing an interface for the field with various credentialing organizations); (14) Prepare OMB clearance package -- prepare, submit, and revise (as necessary) an OMB clearance package that will ensure that the evaluation satisfies the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act; (15) Provide support to the HPB to identify emerging individual and systems issues pertaining to people who are homeless and who have serious mental illness and substance use disorders; (16) Synthesize existing knowledge and information (e.g., research, best practices) and disseminate to the service providers, policy makers, and research communities;

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY  –   Solicitations are not available at this time.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government.

	The Department of Commerce, National Telecommunications and Information Administration (DOC/NTIA) is exploring options for Contractor performance of three, interdependent technical Internet coordinating functions.  In support of the operation of the Internet domain name and addressing system, a Contractor would furnish the necessary personnel, material, equipment, services, and facilities to perform the following services.  First, the Contractor would coordinate the assignment of technical protocol parameters.  This function would involve the review and assignment of unique values to numerous parameters (e.g., operation codes, port numbers, object identifiers, protocol numbers) used in various Internet protocols.  This function would also include dissemination of listings of assigned parameters through various means (including on-line publication) and the review of technical documents for consistency with assigned values.  Second, the Contractor would perform administrative functions associated with root management.  This function would primarily involve facilitation and coordination of the root zone of the Internet domain name and addressing system.  It would include receiving requests for and making routine updates of the country code top level domain contact and nameserver information. Third, the Contractor would allocate IPv4 and IPv6 delegations of IP address space.  This function would include delegation of IP address blocks to regional registries for routine allocation, typically through downstream providers, to Internet end-users within the regions served by those registries.  It would also include reservation and direct allocation of space for special purposes, such as multicast addressing, addresses for private networks, and globally specified applications.

The DOC/NTIA is seeking the following information:

1.	Potential Respondents shall describe how they would propose to successfully perform each of the three services, assuming that all services provided by Respondent would be accomplished in accordance with all applicable U.S. laws, regulations, policies, and procedures.

2.	Potential Respondents shall describe both their existing relationships with the following entities and the extent to which such relationships would enable Respondents to successfully perform each of the three services:
	
	a. the Internet engineering community, 

	b. Internet standards development organizations, 

	c. Regional Internet Registries, 

	d. country code top level domain operators, 

	e. generic and sponsored top level domain operators, and 

	f. national governments or public authorities associated with specific country code top level domains.

3.	Currently, the services are performed under contract at no cost to the United States Government.  Potential Respondents shall describe proposed financial plans, including, if appropriate, the manner in which charges levied for services rendered would be derived.  Charges cannot be based on cost plus a percentage of cost.

Respondents shall not be obligated to provide the services described herein and it is understood by the United States Government that the cost estimates provided as a result of this request are “best” estimates only.

All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary; the United States Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the United States Government.  The response date for this market research is March 7, 2006.  No collect calls will be accepted.  All responses to this RFI may be submitted via e-mail to Carol Silverman, Contracting Officer, at csilverman@doc.gov, courtesy copy to Brendon Johnson, Contracting Officer, at bjohnson@doc.gov and with a hard copy to the U. S. Department of Commerce, Office of Acquisition Management and Financial Assistance, Commerce Acquisition Solutions Division, 1401 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Room 6521, Washington, D.C.  20230.

DEFINING THE COMMUNICATION ENVIRONMENT, AND IDENTIFYING COMMUNICATION NEEDS OF ACC AIRMEN AND SHADOW AUDIENCES

CONTRACTING OFFICE ADDRESS
Department of the Air Force, Air Combat Command (ACC) - HQ ACC CONS, 130 Douglas Street, Suite 401, Langley AFB, A 23665

RESPONSE DATE:  08 April 2006, 5:00 PM EST

RESPOND TO:  Contracting office stated above Attn: Amber Weichbrodt.  See below for format and submission instructions.

ADDITIONAL GENERAL INFORMATION
This is a Request for Information (RFI) only as defined in FAR 15.201(e) to obtain information about pricing, delivery, and other market information or capabilities for planning purposes.  This RFI is not a request for competitive proposals; therefore, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The NAICS code for this potential effort is 541910.

BACKGROUND
The Air Combat Command, Public Affairs (ACC/PA) is seeking to use focused research to define the communication environment and identify communication needs of its Airmen and “shadow audiences” (e.g. retirees and dependents).  Currently, unit-level Public Affairs offices within ACC spend a great deal of time and energy producing a weekly newspaper.  For 18 of the 20 units, this is their “#1 time-consuming product/event.”  Despite the great deal of manpower invested in producing the base newspaper, ACC/PA does not know what impact the paper has.  There is no statistical data to support the assertion that the newspaper is being read; the local newspaper readership surveys are neither scientific nor precise, and they do not draw from a random sample of a base population.  Along the same lines, the impact of other products the PA offices produce and maintain, like the Commander’s Access Channel and base guides, is also not known.

DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT
Given the advent of new technology such as podcasting, short messaging service (SMS), rich site summary (RSS) messaging, and the proliferation of older technology, such as the Internet, ACC/PA is interested in obtaining information from industry to determine, through focused research, if there is a better way of communicating key themes and messages with ACC’s Airmen and shadow audiences.  

Generally speaking, ACC/PA needs to answer two broad questions:
1) How do ACC’s Airmen and shadow audiences obtain news and information?
-	Do they get it from TV?  The Web?  The base newspaper? Their friends?  Their 1st Sgts?
-	In looking at this, it is important to not limit questions to, “How do Airmen get news about the Air Force.”  They may get their Air Force news from their 1st Sgts, but get other news at home when they go to ESPN.com or download their favorite podcast.
o	An effective study will dig down and find out how Airmen and shadow audiences learn about the world in which they live
2)	How do ACC’s Airmen WANT to get information about the Air Force?”  
-	Do Airmen and shadow audiences like base newspaper?  Would they prefer RSS, podcasts, etc.
-	And, is there a correlation between how they SAY they want to get their information and how they currently get their information.  
o	For example, if 90% of Airmen and shadow audiences say they want their news via SMS, but only 3% of them have SMS-enabled phones, we need to know that.

<DESC>The Army Field Support Command is conducting a Sources Sought/Market Survey for a contemplated systems contract for the 155MM M110A2 SMK WP, DODIC D550, NSN: 1320-01-465-3955.  The M110A2 projectile is a hollow steel shell filled with 15.6 lbs of white phosphorous (WP).  The M110A2 uses a Composition B5 explosive burster (M54A1 Burste r) which runs down the center of the entire length of the shell.  A PD fuze is normally used with these projectiles, although an MTSQ fuze may also be used.  For shipment and handling, a lifting plug is installed in the fuze cavity.  A rotating band encirc les the projectile near the base and is protected by a grommet to be removed before loading the projectile in the weapon.  The M110A2 projectile is fired from 155mm howitzers to provide spotting/marking smoke.  The projectile also provides some screening s moke.  This survey is being conducted to evaluate the feasibility of a system procurement and production capability for the subject items.   A technical data package will be provided, upon request, to assist respondents in developing their capability state ments.  Estimated quantities would be approximately 5,000 per year.  Potential respondents are advised that this requirement contains technical data that states that it for limited distribution however, the actual distribution level is A.  Send request for  TDP to brownn@afsc.army.mil.  Please include with your request your complete mailing address and POC name, phone number and email address.  TDP will be issued via electronic means if possible or U.S. mail unless provided with your request is authorization  to send via Federal Express and your Federal Express Account Number.

This information should be provided for all critical parts and operation including, but not limited to production of the Metal Parts, M1E1 Burster Casing, M54A1 Burster and Load, Assem ble and Pack.  Interested companies who have the necessary capabilities should respond by providing the following information; a summary of your companys capabilities; description of facilities, personnel, and manufacturing capabilities and experiences an d how they directly relate to the planned procurement; estimated minimum and maximum monthly production quantities; estimated prices; and the minimum procurement quantity (MPQ) required for production.  A respondent should state if they have made this item  in the past.  If a respondent has made this item in the past, but not to the Technical Data Package issued with this announcement the differences shall be provided and an explanation provided as to how the respondent intends to meet the requirements of th is TDP.  If a respondent does not currently have complete relevant resources (facilities, equipment, technical, personnel, etc.) available, the respondent must identify their needs and be able to specifically demonstrate his ability to obtain those resourc es in a timely fashion.  If a respondent chooses to utilize the services of sub-tier vendors or subcontractors, those vendors or subcontractors must also meet these criteria.  Respondents shall provide detailed information concerning the benefits of a syst em contract versus component breakout.  Detail should be provided for significant savings in the areas of cost, quality, and production as well as any perceived reduction in the Governments risk by awarding a system contract.

<SUBJECT>68 -- Notice of intent to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for certain Petroleum Products.
<DESC>U.S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION
Small Business Size Standards: Waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule
AGENCY:  U.S. Small Business Administration.
ACTION: Notice of intent to Waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for certain Petroleum Products.  
SUMMARY:  The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is considering granting a request for a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Industrial Gases Manufacturing; Refinery Gases made in Petroleum Refineries; Cyrogenic Tanks, Heavy Gauge Metal Manufacturing; Liquid Oxygen Tanks Manufacturing; Liquefied Petroleum Gases (LPG) Cylinders Manufacturing;  Bulk Storage Tanks, Heavy Gauge Metal, Manufacturing; Gas Storage Tanks, Heavy Gauge Metal, Manufacturing; and Cylinders, Pressure, Heavy Gauge Metal, Manufacturing.  
 According to the request, no small business manufacturers supply these classes of products to the Federal government.  If granted, the waiver would allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses; service-disabled veteran-owned small business or SBA’s 8(a) Business Development Program.  
 

DATE: Comments and source information must be submitted [WITHIN 15 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES].
ADDRESSES:  You may submit comments and source information to Edith Butler, Program Analyst, U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Government Contracting, 409 3rd Street, SW, Suite 8800, Washington, DC 20416.
FOR FURTHER INFORMATI0N CONTACT: Edith Butler, Program Analyst, by telephone at (202) 619-0422; by FAX at (202) 481-1788; or by email at edith.butler@sba.gov.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Section 8(a)(17) of the Small Business Act (Act), 15 U.S.C.§ 637(a)(17), requires that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or SBA’s 8(a) Business Development Program provide the product of a small business manufacturer or processor, if the recipient is other than the actual manufacturer or processor of the product. This requirement is commonly referred to as the Nonmanufacturer Rule.  The SBA regulations imposing this requirement are found at 13 CFR §121.406(b).  Section 8(a)(17)(b)(iv) of the Act authorizes SBA to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for any "class of products" for which there are no small business manufacturers or processors available to participate in the Federal market.  
 

     As implemented in SBA’s regulations at 13 CFR §121.1202(c), in order to be considered available to participate in the Federal market for a class of products, a small business manufacturer must have submitted a proposal for a contract solicitation or received a contract from the Federal government within the last 24 months.
The SBA defines "class of products" based on six digit coding systems.  The coding system is the Office of Management and Budget North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  
     The SBA is currently processing a request to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Industrial Gases Manufacturing; Refinery Gases made in Petroleum Refineries; Cyrogenic Tanks, Heavy Gauge Metal Manufacturing; Liquid Oxygen Tanks Manufacturing; Liquefied Petroleum Gases (LPG) Cylinders Manufacturing;  Bulk Storage Tanks, Heavy Gauge Metal, Manufacturing; Gas Storage Tanks, Heavy Gauge Metal, Manufacturing; and Cylinders, Pressure, Heavy Gauge Metal, Manufacturing.  
North  American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes 325120, 324110 and 332420.  The public is invited to comment or provide source information to SBA on the proposed waivers of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for these classes of NAICS codes within 15 days after date of publication in the Federal Business Opportunities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Section 8(a)(17) of the Small Business Act (Act), 15 U.S.C.§637(a)(17), requires that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or SBA’s 8(a) Business Development Program provide the product of a small business manufacturer or processor, if the recipient is other than the actual manufacturer or processor of the product. This requirement is commonly referred to as the Nonmanufacturer Rule.  The SBA regulations imposing this requirement are found at 13 CFR§121.406(b).  Section 8(a)(17)(b)(iv) of the Act authorizes SBA to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for any "class of products" for which there are no small business manufacturers or processors available to participate in the Federal market.  
     As implemented in SBA’s regulations at 13 CFR§121.1202(c), in order to be considered available to participate in the Federal market for a class of products, a small business manufacturer must have submitted a proposal for a contract solicitation or received a contract from the Federal government within the last 24 months. The SBA defines "class of products" based on a six digit coding systems. 
 
 The coding system is the Office of Management and Budget North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  
     The SBA is currently processing a request to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Furniture (except drafting tables, hospital beds, medical furniture) merchant wholesalers; Office Furniture Merchant Wholesalers; Furniture (except wood), Office-Type, Padded, Upholstered, or Plain, Manufacturing; Furniture Design Services; Furniture Frames and Parts, Metal, Manufacturing; Furniture Frames, Wood, Manufacturing; Furniture Parts, Finished Metal, Manufacturing; Furniture Parts, Finished Plastics, Manufacturing; Furniture Parts, Finished Wood, Manufacturing;  Furniture, Factory-type (e.g., cabinets, stools, tool stands, work benches), Manufacturing; Furniture, Hospital (e.g., hospital beds, operating room furniture), Manufacturing; and Furniture, Laboratory-type (e.g., benches, cabinets, stools, tables), Manufacturing, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 423210.  The public is invited to comment or provide source information to SBA on the proposed waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for this class of NAICS code within 15 days after date of publication in the Federal Business Opportnities.

<SUBJECT>B -- BPA for Appraisals
<DESC>BPA for Appraisals

The Natural Resources Conservation Service in Missouri is anticipating establishment of blanket purchase agreements for appraisals. These appraisals will be completed on land located throughout the state of Missouri that may be placed under a conservation easement through the Grassland Reserve Program (GRP) or the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP). The purpose of the appraisals is to provide an opinion of market value, as defined below, of the entire subject property (larger parcel) before acquisition of an easement (before value) and an opinion of market value of the entire subject property remaining after the proposed easement has been placed (after value) as of a current date of value. The appraiser shall recognize that in a before and after appraisal, the partial interest being acquired is not actually being appraised. What is appraised is the larger parcel before and after the conveyance of the partial interest.  

The purpose of two opinions of value is to establish the effect on value resulting from imposition of a conservation easement. The price of the easement is the before value of the entire property (larger parcel) minus the value of the entire property as encumbered a Conservation Warranty Easement Deed, after value, provided there are not adjustments such as excess irrigation water rights explained below, which would equal the price of the easement. A key concept in this appraisal process is defining the larger parcel is required to begin the appraisal process. The appraisals must be completed in compliance with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions and Supplemental Standards issued by NRCS. If you are interested in providing a quote for services, please contact the Contracting Officer at renee.gardner@mo.usda.gov for a copy of the BPA.

<SUBJECT>D--REQUEST FOR INFORMATION-APPLICATION SERVICE PROVIDER
<DESC>DESCRIPTION This is not a notice for a solicitation. This is only a Request for Information (RFI).  The government does not intend to award a contract or any type of agreement on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicitated under this RFI.  This is NOT a request for proposal or an invitation to bid but merely a request for information. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is considering the feasibility of using a private sector application service provider (ASP) to host a centralized, secure, web-based utility that would selectively connect all USGS Water Science Centers (WSC) to any number of cooperating analytical laboratories.  There are approximately 50 WSCs located nationwide, typically one/state.  Such connectivity would permit WSCs to enter sample event information and simultaneously request required analytical services from cooperating laboratories.  During this initial, streamlined process, the application would assign a unique identifier to each sample that would be used by the USGS, its WSCs, and cooperating laboratories to track and manage all future activity related to the sample.  The general functionality of the process is summarized as follows. Initial session: 1a. A USGS WSC logs into the ASP web site and is immediately provided with records specific to its location. 2a. WSC personnel enter sample identification (ID) information using a short series of pull-down menus. 3a. WSC next uses a pull-down menu to select a cooperating laboratory where analytical tests will be performed. 4a. Tests and services available from the selected laboratory also are selected from pull-down menus.  WSCs can group laboratory tests together as "panels" or "schedules" and save them to streamline future analytical service request sessions. 5a. After laboratory test selection is complete, the application displays corresponding sample bottle type and sample preservative requirements. 6a. After the request has been completed, the ASP utility assigns a unique identification number (UID) that is used by the USGS, its WSCs, and cooperating laboratories to track and manage all future activity related to the sample. 7a. This UID is included on various printed forms and barcode labels that are affixed to sample containers at the USGS WSC. Later session: 1b. The WSC logs into the application.  UIDs for all 'in process' requests are listed and provide access previously entered records. 2b. Sampling-event information entry is completed-collection date and time, typically-and requested laboratory test requirements are compared with event samples collected; laboratory test requests can be revised if necessary. 3b. Once complete, the ASP utility sends a record of completed requests to the WSC and cooperating laboratory to be used in future sample management and data processing operations. Supporting information: a. A resident database for each USGS WSC (currently 50 WSC each having < 50 users) that contains user-specific records such as contact information, user code, account numbers, station identification numbers, and station names (currently <50 different fields, with most fields having <50 possible entries, and some fields having 100-1,000 possible entries).  The application would allow a USGS office to update and modify these records when necessary. b. A resident database that contains laboratory tests (< 1,000 different laboratory tests), bottle requirements (< 25 different bottle types), and preservation requirements (< 25 different preservation requirements).  There are < 200 possible laboratories to select. c. There are typically 40,000 requests per year. ASPs that believe they have the expertise and experience to meet this requirement with a Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) or turnkey product, may submit a response to this RFI.  A response should also include the following information: 1. A listing of any current or past federal government clients for the COTS including a technical and/or contracting officer point of contact. 2. An explanation of the basic fee assessment used by the ASP, i.e., a cost/transaction, etc. 3. A statement regarding the capability and ease of tailoring the ASP service to specific customer requirements 4. A statement identifying capability to provide services 24 hours a day, seven days a week, as well as, the capability to automatically switch over to an alternate site in case of unplanned interruptions in service. 5. A statement regarding compliance with the basic security measures, guidelines, or regulations the vendor's application meets or exceeds (for example, HIPAA for medical records and FISMA requirements associated with properly safeguarding USGS sensitive information). The response format should not exceed 10 pages inclusive of tables and figures.  Questions and all responses should be submitted to Diana Romero, the Contracting Officer, at dlromero@usgs.gov.  Responses are due on or before March 7, 2006.  Any subsequent solicitation will be synopsized prior to its release.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

HSAR 3009.104-75 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES
[DEC 2003] 

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

3.	The tear down report and recommendations of the selected contractor will be reviewed by the CO and the Government point of contact to be designated at the time of award.  Upon completion of the review, the CO shall provide instructions to the selected contractor on how to proceed with the work.

4.	Upon receipt of instructions from the CO, the selected contractor shall provide all necessary special tools, labor, and parts to perform the requested work on the propeller assembly.  If any additional discrepancies outside of normal repair criteria are discovered during performance of the work, the selected discrepancies, to include any parts required, labor required, and cost estimate for the additional work.  This work will be considered as “over-and-above” costs {For purposes of this Statement of Work, the term “over and above” shall mean:  “Item discrepancies discovered during routine scheduled maintenance or during unscheduled maintenance which are not a part of a continuous maintenance program”}.  The selected contractor will not proceed with the additional work until approval for the additional work is received from the Contracting Officer.  The selected contractor shall accomplish all the work in accordance with the manufacturer’s repair/overhaul manuals and applicable repair station procedures.  The selected contractor shall bench test the assemblies for proper performance parameters within the manufacturer’s limits.  Propeller will be returned to the AOC on the same transportation stand provided at delivery.

Technical Requirements

The selected contractor must be a certified FAA Repair Station and/or Authorized Hamilton Sunstrand Service Center covering 54H60-77 propeller type.

Parts or components in an “as removed” condition will not be installed in the assemblies.  Any part or component that has not reached its recommended service life but fails inspection and needs to be replaced will be treated as an “over-and-above.”  Since the Government cannot determine which parts or components, if any, meet these criteria, bidding maintenance contractors shall provide, in writing, the labor rate they will charge the Government, per hour for “over-and-above” discrepancies.  Secondly, bidding contractors are asked to provide what percent discount off list price for replacement parts will be given.  The selected contractor shall provide the AOC with a warranty providing a minimum of one hundred hours flight time or six (6) months from time of installation of the propeller.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

In April 2006 the Center for Coastal Fisheries and Habitat Research (CCFHR) is conducting a 16 day research cruise to the Navassa National Wildlife Refuge.  Navassa is a small, uninhabited island located approximately 35 miles west of Haiti.  The Refuge is a protected area under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, but it faces heavy fishing pressure from artisanal fishers from Haiti.  An essential objective of the research cruise is to produce quantitative estimates of the amount and type of artisanal fishing gear, the type of habitat fished, and the type of catch landed.  

We require a contractor to assist with this gear impact study.  Specifically, the contractor must:

1) Be fluent in both English and Haitian Creole, to facilitate interviews with local fishermen; 

2) be a demonstrably certified Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) SCUBA diver, to participate in gear surveys and be able to obtain National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) observer status which includes; 
- Dive certification of at least open water 
- Evidence of at least 10 logged dives, one of which has been conducted within the previous three months indication the appropriate proficiencies required for the diving conditions likely to be encountered 
- Evidence of fitness to dive as indicated on an "Observer Diver Medical History Report" signed by a health care provider (MD, PA, Nurse practitioner, or osteopath) within 12 months of the dive ops, AND approval of the NOAA ships health services questionnaire
- Passing a checkout dive with NOAA personnel

3)  Provide their own dive gear (with an inventory of such gear), and records indicating proper maintenance (e.g. serviced within the last year) 

4) Have previous experience working in Navassa NWR, to serve as a local guide;
	
5) Be demonstrably familiar with marine fisheries issues (socioeconomics or biology).

The work will be performed only on the research cruise, under the guidance of the cruise principal investigator.  In addition to the above duties, the contractor may be required to participate in other cruise activities as necessary, (e.g. assisting with scientific dive operations and to assist with drop camera and hydrographic surveys).

The contractor should provide their own SCUBA gear; any other materials or supplies will be the responsibility of CCFHR. The contractor will be responsible for their own transportation to and from the Research Vessel NANCY FOSTER. 

The contractor will keep a daily journal of their cruise activities, including detailed descriptions of interactions and interviews with the artisanal fishermen.  This journal will be provided to the principal investigator at the end of the cruise.  The contents and products will become property of CCFHR.  The contractor may use the information in reports/studies but must notify CCFHR prior to publication and acknowledge CCFHR in the report.

It is anticipated that the following itinerary will apply:  
April 17, 2006:  San Juan, Puerto Rico to meet the research 	vessel, the NOAA ship NANCY FOSTER.
	April 20-April 30:  Serve as translator and diver on research cruise to Navassa.
	May 1:  Disembark the ship in Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic.

Selection will be based on dive qualifications, language skills, price, and other factors such as demonstrated knowledge of area and subject matter.

Total Estimated cost for this procurement is less than $10,000.00. This project is set aside for small business.

<DESC>The Library of Congress intends to negotiate a sole source Contract with Poly Foam Inc.
The Library of Congress, National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS/BPH) contracts out for braille books and magazines, audio books and magazines, playback machines, and related goods and services that service approximately 750,000 blind and handicapped patrons.  This proposed purchase is for styrofoam inserts that are used in the shipping of audio playback machines sent to NLS/BPH blind and handicapped patrons. This proposed purchase is for 20,020 styrofoam inserts. Poly Foam Inc. has been using the Library=s tooling to manufacture the styrofoam inserts for the past five (5) years. The Library=s tooling is at Poly Foam Inc.=s manufacturing facility in Lester Prairie, Minnesota. The tool is enormous in size,  fragile, weighs over 600 pounds, is over fifteen years old, and has a replacement cost of over $100,000. This tooling is a custom-designed for the production of these styrofoam inserts. Any attempt to ship the tooling from Poly Foam=s manufacturing facility would likely damage the tooling. It is the Library’s understanding that (1) a new contractor would not be able to reassemble the tooling, (2) operate the old tooling or (3) manufacture these styrofoam inserts without the tooling that is used by Poly Foam, Inc. at its manufacturing facility in Minnesota. 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within fifteen (15) days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

ALL Quoters shall also include information on their ability and the means to furnish the required monthly requirement of delivered flags to the delivery destination including information on supply/service availability from first and second tier suppliers of finished material and flag weaving and embroidery, if any. The Quoter must affirmatively state in the quote that flags furnished will conform to the federal specification (as modified in the item description); the public law (PL 105-261 section 1073); and the non-manufacturer rule (FAR 19.001) which states: "In the performance of the contract, the product described in the statement of work herein (Interment Flag) must be the product of a small business manufacturer or producer. The end product furnished must be manufactured or produced in the United States or its outlying areas. The term "nonmanufacturer" includes a concern that can, but elects not to, manufacture or produce the end product for the specific acquisition. For size determination purposes, there can be only one manufacturer of the end product being acquired. The manufacturer of the end product being acquired is the concern that, with its own forces, transforms inorganic or organic substances including raw materials and/or miscellaneous parts or components into the end product."  The contract resulting from this RFQ requires delivery on the last government working day of each month to the delivery destination which shall be: Department of Veterans Affairs, Service and Distribution Center, First Avenue (1 block north of 22nd Street), Hines, IL 60141. The first month of the base period and each exercised option will have a required delivery quantity of 5212, with the remaining eleven months of the exercised option requiring a delivery quantity of 5208.  All deliveries shall be FOB Destination.  Four additional flags shall be included with the initial delivery for the base period and subjected to first article testing by the Government.  The accepted first articles shall be included in the required delivery quantity and used as manufacturing templates for production of flags during the base period and each exercised option. The place(s) of performance must be clearly specified in the technical quotes.  The contracting officer may at the Government's discretion conduct a preaward survey to determine technical capability of any quoter.  Past Performance:  The quoter shall include past performance information in its technical quote consisting of the address, phone, and email address of the technical and contractual points of contact for at least one but no more than four customers to whom it furnished flags of similar design, quality, and complexity within the last three years.  The Government intends to contact these references for past performance information. Volume II, Price Quote.  Pricing must be provided in a separate volume with the unit price specified for each flag, the extended price for a given month, and the required number of flags multiplied by the unit price for flags for the base and option period. There shall be a base period and four options under the contract resulting from the RFQ - each twelve months in length. The exercise of each option is at the sole discretion of the Government.   Prices proposed shall be FOB Destination to the destination specified above.  T!  he perio d of performance is 60 months, including four options, each twelve months in length.  Paragraph (e) Multiple quotes of FAR 52.212-1 is changed to read:  Quoters are not permitted to submit multiple quotes presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Small business type:  Each Quoter may compete in one or more business categories for which it is eligible and for whch it declares it's desire to be considered, however, only one quotation shall be submitted and only one award made to any quoter to this RFQ.  Participation of Commercial Firms.  Quoters are advised that the commercial firm identified below will assist the Government in providing acquisition support during the source selection.  This firm will be authorized access to only those portions of the quote data and discussions that are necessary to enable them to perform their respective duties. The firm shall be expressly prohibited from competing on the subject acquisition and from quote rating, ranking, or recommending the selection of a source. Government Contract Solutions, Inc. POC:  Mr. Frank Flutter	  Telephone: (202) 273 -7657	 Facsimile:  (202) 273 -7448 E-mail:  Frank.Flutter@va.gov    In accomplishing the duties related to the source selection process, the aforementioned Firm and Support Contractor may require access to proprietary information contained in the Quoters' quotes.  Therefore, pursuant to FAR 9.505-4, these Firms and the Support Contractor shall execute an agreement with each Quoter that states that they will (1) protect the Quoter's information from unauthorized use or disclosure for as long as it remains proprietary and (2) refrain from using the information for any purpose other than that for which it was furnished.  To expedite the evaluation process, it is requested that each Quoter contact the above firm and support contractor to effect execution of such agreement prior to submission of quotes. Each Quoter shall submit copies of the agreements with its quote. The following clause is added as an addendum to FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (JAN 2006) Quoters: VAAR 852.214-73   Bid Samples (SEPT 1993). Any bid sample(s) furnished must be in the quantities specified in the solicitation and plainly marked with the complete lettering/numbering and description of the related bid item(s); the number of the Invitation for Bids (Request For Quotation); and the name of the bidder submitting the bid sample(s).   Cases or packages containing any bid sample(s) must be plainly marked "Bid Sample(s)" and all charges pertaining to the preparation and transportation of bid sample(s) must be prepaid by the bidder.   Bid sample(s) must be received at the location specified in the solicitation by the time and date for receipt of bids.  .  FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation -Commercial Items (JAN 1999) is incorporated by reference and (a) of the clause is changed to read: The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose quote, conforming to the request for quotation, is the most advantageous (best value) quote, price and other factors considered. The evaluation factors are: technical capability, past performance, and price. Technical capability is more important than past performance.  Technical capability and past performance when combined are significantly more important than price. The Government intends to award four contracts - one each to HUB Zone small business, service disabled veteran small business, a small disadvantaged business (8(a)), and a small business. The Government shall make only one award to any quoter.  Each quoter may submit only one quotation which may be considered in each award category that the quoter specifies (HUBZone small business concern, small disadvantaged business (8(a)), Service disabled veteran small business, and small business) for which it is eligible to compete in the RFQ. Evaluation and award shall be done sequentially. HUBZone small business concern, small disadvantaged business (8(a)), Service disabled veteran small business, and small business categories shall be evaluated in that order. There shall be only one award per category, with the exception of small business which may have more than one award if an award was not made in the HubZone, 8(a), or Service disabled veteran categories.  For example, all HubZone firms not awarded a contract shall be evaluated for 8(a) award if otherwise eligible and the quoter has indicated a desire to be considered in that category. Quoters not receiving an 8(a) award and eligible and interested in the small service disabled veteran category shall be evaluated for award.  Those firms not receiving an award in any category shall be considered for award if eligible and expressing an interest in the small business category.  If an award was not made in one or more categories, an additional contract(s) may be awarded under the small business cat!  egory.   There shall not be more than four awards resulting from this RFQ. Once a firm receives an award in any one category, it may not be considered in any other category.  The interment flag is a critical requirement requiring more than one source of supply. The RFQ NAICS code is 314999. Each quoter may only receive a maximum of (1) one award.  Once a quoter's quote has received an award, that quote will no longer be considered under any additional categories. HUBZone Category/Award: (1) In accordance with [Federal Acquisition Regulation] FAR Part 19.13, any award resulting from this category will be made on a competitive basis to a qualified, eligible [Historically Underutilized Business Zone] HUBZone business concern, provided that at least two (2) competitive (technical and price) quotes are received from qualified HUBZone business concerns.  If only one (1) competitive quote is received from a qualified HUBZone business concern, then that quote may still be considered for award under this category. (2) If a minimum of one (1) competitive quote from an eligible HUBZone business concern is not received, the award of any contract resulting from this category will be made to a small business concern in accordance with FAR Part 19.5, provided that a minimum of one (1) competitive (technical and cost) quote is received from a qualified small business concern. (3) If a minimum of one (1) competitive quote from a qualified small business concern is not received, the award of any contract resulting from this category will be made on the basis of full and open competition from among all responsible business concerns submitting quotes. Section 8(a) Business Concern: (1) In accordance with [Federal Acquisition Regulation] FAR Part 19.8, any award resulting from this category will be made on a competitive basis to a qualified, eligible Section 8(a) business concern, provided that a minimum of two (2) competitive (technical and cost) quotes are received from eligible Section 8(a) business concerns.  If only one (1) competitive quote is received from a qualified Section 8(a) business concern, then that quote may still be considered for award under this category. In accordance with FAR 19.800(e), within the 8(a) category, priority for award shall be given to hub zone 8(a) firms.  (2) If a minimum of one (1) competitive quote from an eligible Section 8(a) business concern is not received, the award of any contract resulting from this category will be made to a small business in accordance with FAR Part 19.5, provided that a minimum of one (1) competitive (technical and cost) quote is received from a qualified small business concern. (3) If a minimum of one (1) competitive quote from a qualified small business concern is not received, the award of any contract resulting from this category will be made on the basis of full and open competition from among all responsible business concerns submitting quotes. Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Category/Award: (1) In accordance with [Federal Acquisition Regulation] FAR Part 19.14, any award resulting from this category will be made on a competitive basis to a qualified, eligible service disabled veteran owned small business concern, provided that a minimum of two (2) competitive (technical and cost) quotes are received from eligible service disabled veteran owned small business concerns.  If only one (1) competitive quote is received from a qualified service disabled veteran owned small business concern, then that quote may still be considered for award under this category.    (2) If a minimum of one (1) competitive quote from an eligible service disabled veteran owned small business concern is not received, the award of any contract resulting from this category will be made to a small business in accordance with FAR Part 19.5, provided that a minimum of one (1) competitive (technical and cost) quote is received from a qualified small business concern. (3) If a minimum of one (1) competitive quote from a qualified small business concern is not received, the award of any contract resulting from this category will be made on the basis of full and open competition from among all responsible business concerns submitting quotes. Small Businesses: (1) In accordance with [Federal Acquisition Regulation] FAR Part 19.5, any award resulting from this category will be made on a competitive basis to a qualified, eligible small business concern, provided that a minimum of two (2) competitive (technical and cost) quotes are received from eligible small business concerns.  If only one (1) competitive quote is received from a qualified small business concern, then that quote may still be considered for award under this category.  (2) If a minimum of one (1) competitive quote from a qualified small business concern is not received, the award of any contract resulting from this category will be made on the basis of full and open competition from among all responsible business concerns submitting quotes. Each Quoter may compete in one or more business categories for which it is eligible and for whch it declares it's desire to be considered, however, only one quotation shall be submitted and only one award made to any quoter to this RFQ.  In the event award cannot be made within the hub zone small business,  small disadvantaged business (8(a)), or service disabled veteran small business categories, an attempt will be made to award to a small business.  Within the 8(a) category, priority for award shall be given to HubZone 8(a) firms.   Award will be made to the responsible quoter submitting the quotation which provides the best value to the Government price and other factors considered.  The quoter's bid sample (if not currently manufacturing and supplying the interment flag to the Veteran's Administration) must conform to the modified specification cited in the RFQ in order to be considered technically capable. The Government will make an award to the responsible quoter(s) that provides the best overall value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Quotes shall be evaluated using the following non-price factors: technical capability and past performance. Technical capability is more important than past performance.  Technical capability and past performance when combined are significantly more important than price.  Technical capability is assessed using the tested bid sample (unless the quoter is a current supplier with a history of providing acceptable items - i.e. interment flags to the DVA); the description of the means by which the quoter ensures timely delivery to the DVA and obtains the necessary material or services from its suppliers to produce the interment flag; and its conformance to the applicable laws and regulations including the non-manufacturer rule and Public Law 105-261 Section 1073.  Past performance shall be evaluated. In conducting the past performance assessment, the Government may use data obtained from other sources as well as from the quote.  The evaluation will examine the quoter's actual performance on supplying similar flags and items and the relevance to the DVA interment flag procurement. The Government may contact some or all references provided by the quoter.  Past performance information will be obtained through one or more of the following: Government past performance databases; references supplied by the quoter; and other sources of past performance information known to the Government, including commercial sources. Past performance will assess the quoter's performance history with i!  ts custo mers for the same or substantially the same government/commercial item (flags) manufactured from the same material and of substantially the same quality.  If the Contracting Officer determines that a small business' past performance and/or technical capability is not satisfactory, the matter shall be referred to the Small Business Administration for a Certificate of Competency determination, in accordance with the procedures contained in FAR Subpart 19.6 and 15 U.S.C. 637(b)(7).]  The price evaluation shall be performed to determine if the prices proposed are fair and reasonable. Quotes with materially unbalanced pricing may be rejected by the contracting officer.   Quotes are due March 9, 2006, 3:00 p.m. to: Dept of Veteran's Affairs (049A3F), 810 Vermont, NW, Washington, DC  20240-0001, Attn: Chris Burroughs.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR SENIOR STRESS ANALYST FOR GLOBAL PRECIPITATION MEASUREMENT PROJECT.  Companies shall acknowledge all  amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to address questions. The questions and answers are as follows: Q: 1. Does this solicitation require full time on-site support?  If not, how many on-site hours per week are required? A: 1. The approximate number of hours for on-site support is 746 total.  All hours worked are required to be on-site.   Face-to-face interaction is required with designers and junior engineers, especially in the mentoring component of the task. Q: 2. Can multiple engineers work on this project?  Designate one engineer as a lead engineer with a supporting staff. A: 2. No, one senior-level, on-site engineer is required. Q: 3. The period of performance is stated as approximately 7 months (or 30 weeks).  Should we base our estimate upon a 40 hour week for this duration?   A: 3. Estimate should be based on 746 hours over a 7 month period.  Obviously, the dates have slipped, but the overall requirement is the same in preparation for our PDR. Q: 4. Regarding information on past performance, how much detail is required for your evaluation?  A specific company has completed over 40 projects associated with space flight hardware.  Is a brief description of the most relevant projects sufficient? A: 4. Brief descriptions are sufficient.  If more information is required, we will request it. Q: 5. Can portions of the work be performed off-site (contractor’s facilities)? A: 5. No, the contractor must be located onsite.  One of the key aspects of this position is mentoring of junior analysts, which requires face-to-face contact on almost a daily basis.	One junior analyst in particular has barely two years of experience and we want to help this analyst gain necessary skills as quickly as possible. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) by FEBRUARY 21,2006.  NO EXCEPTIONS!!! Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.	These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>The following are questions and answers concerning the solicitation.  No changes are made to the solicitation at this time.

Question 1.  What are the payment terms?    The reason I am asking this question is because we currently have a contract for 27 vehicles that is being funded by the U.S State Department, and for which we have received a down payment of 50%.  The balance will be paid to us upon delivery in country.   [We don't] have to receive a deposit to fulfill a contract; however, we can bid a lower cost if the deposit is available for qualified contractors.
Answer:  Payment will be made in arrears.  No advance payments or down payments are allowed.  Payment terms are included in FAR 52.212-4.

Question 2.  From our past experience, in supplying these type of vehicles thru direct sales or FMS contracts with TACOM, the end-users have always wanted the equipment that comes standard with the vehicles as they are supplied to the U.S. Government.  Would it be acceptable to bid the base vehicle and list options separately?
Answer:  Options may be listed separately, as long as the unit price and total price are clear.

Question 3.  The solicitation reads “Preference for Privately Owned U.S. Flag Commercial Vessels”?  Does this mean non-U.S. Flag vessels are acceptable?   If we can use any flag carrier, we would be able to obtain a more competitive freight rate.
Answer:  The rules are covered in FAR clause 52.247-64.  The FAR may be found at www.acqnet.gov.
