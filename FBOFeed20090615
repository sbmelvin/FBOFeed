<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SAUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT:
The Bureau of Reclamation is seeking experienced researchers or scientists to implement the existing Reclamation numerical model, SRH-2D, to run efficiently on a multi-core desktop PC and be applicable to practical river flows.
An overview and statement of work follow, along with the mandatory requirements for this solicitation.  Please contact Bill Holbert, Contract Specialist for the Bureau of Reclamation, at 303-445-2448 or wholbert@usbr.gov if you can meet these mandatory requirements 100%.  
Parallelization of a Two-Dimensional Hydraulic Model to Run on Multi-Core PCsA.   OVERVIEW
The goal of this effort is to develop a parallelization methodology and then implement an existing two-dimensional (2D) depth-averaged hydraulic flow model (SRH-2D) to run efficiently on multi-core desktop personal computers with Linux and Window based operating systems. At present, a desktop computer is equipped with quad-core processors with reasonable costs. More processors are being packaged into a single desktop system. However, most existing 2D hydraulic models do not take advantage of the multi-processor feature of the PCs though they have been routinely applied to river projects at Reclamation. A single processor is used to run the model at present and application often is limited to a reach less than 10 miles. There is a strong need at Reclamation to apply the 2D model to longer river reach (e.g. 100 miles). Reclamation would like to resort to parallel computing, on the multi-core PCs, to achieve the goal. B.  OBJECTIVE OF REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS
The objective of this RFP is listed below:
Reclamation seeks experienced researchers or scientists to implement the existing Reclamation numerical model, SRH-2D, to run efficiently on a multi-core desktop PC and be applicable to practical river flows.
SRH-2D is a two-dimensional (2D) depth-averaged hydraulic flow model which is specifically designed to simulation open channel flows. A few unique features which may impact the parallelization effort are listed below:
"	It is a finite-volume based model with sequential flow solver;"	It is an implicit solver which resorts to a liner equation matrix solver (conjugate gradient, CG, type of solvers are used); therefore, an efficient parallel solver of the linear equation using the CG method is critical; and "	It uses an unstructured mesh with mixed triangular and quadrilateral cells. Therefore, a domain decomposition strategy is needed which is applicable to complex flow domains; and"	It is written with FORTRAN 90.
Mandatory qualifications of the principal investigator (PI) for achieving the project objective are listed below:
"	The PI must have an extensive experience in the numerical model development either in the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) area or in the computational hydraulics (CH) area so that SRH-2D source code is familiar to him or her;"	The PI must have prior experience in implementing an implicit fluid flow  solver to run on multi-core desktop PCs. Experience in the development of the parallel version of CG (Conjugate Gradient) type linear equation solver, i.e. parallelization of an implicit model, is a must qualification; and"	The PI should be fluent in FORTRAN 90.
Those who do not meet the above qualifications will not be considered. 

C.  STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) 
The first year of this project has a committed fund of $50,000; and the first year work scope includes the following four tasks:
1.  Task 1: Development of the Parallelization StrategyA general strategy is to be laid out first with regard to the parallelization of SRH-2D, such as what methods are selected and why. The strategy includes the domain decomposition method suitable for the unstructured mesh, the selection of the parallel language (MPI or OPEN-MP), operating system (Linux or Window), required software and hardwire needed, etc.
2. Task 2: Parallelization of SRH-2D ModelThis task focuses on the development of a parallel version of SRH-2D in FORTRAN 90. The source code of SRH-2D written in FORTRAN 90 will be available. A number of parallel issues are considered in this task including: a profile analysis to list the most time consuming routines (procedures), parallel linear equation solver with CG type solver or equivalent, domain decomposition issue, etc.
3. Task 3: Test and Demonstration of Parallelization Performance   A sample case related to a real river flow will be provided to the PI by Reclamation to test, measure, and demonstrate the success of the parallelization effort. Results on 2-, 4-, and 8-nodes are anticipated. A successful parallelization of SRH-2D will be measured by two factors: (a)  the model gives the correct results in comparison with the serial version of the model; and (b) the speed-up obtained on the multi-core PC. 
4. Task 4: Documentation, Deliverables, and AssistanceA final report and the parallel version of SRH-2D will be the deliverables at the end of the first year effort. This task also includes an installation assistance by the PI so that the parallel SRH-2D may be run on Reclamation multi-core PCs. 
The proposer has to decide whether the first find limit ($50,000) is enough to accomplish the above four tasks. Higher funding request will not be considered.
The second and third year work is contingent on the success of the first year results and is not guaranteed. The estimated available fund is about $25,000 per year and the work scope is listed below:
5. Task 5: Model Improvement and Refinement (Second Year Option)The second year task is to focus on rewriting SRH-2D model to make it more efficient for parallel computing. It may be achieved by a number of possible ways, but it envisioned change is the development of new solution algorithm. A final report will be delivered documenting the changes made to SRH-2D and the improvements in computing speed achieved.
6. Task 6: Parallelization of Sediment Transport ModuleThe third year task focuses on the parallelization of the sediment transport module, in addition to the flow model completed in the first year. A final report and the parallel version of the sediment transport module integrated into SRH-2D will be the deliverables.

<DESC><p>The Department of Education intends to make a sole source award to the National Academy of Science, located in Washington, DC, to conduct External Evaluation of National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR) grant processes and summative reviews of its grantees.</p>
<p>NIDRR grantees include major research universities, medical rehabilitation facilities, and technology research corporations. NIDRR sponsors research in three major domains that are relevant to the lives in individuals with disabilities: Health &amp; Function, Participation &amp; Community Living, and Employment. Within each of these domains, NIDRR sponsors research to address a diversity of research questions and development goals. To address these questions and goals, NIDRR-sponsored researchers utilize a wide variety of methodological approaches, including (but not limited to) rehabilitation engineering, secondary data analyses, survey data collection and analysis (longitudinal and cross sectional), qualitative analysis, meta-analysis, single-subject designs, and randomized clinical trials.</p>
<p>The proposed external evaluation has two phases which include,&nbsp;a process evaluation and a summative review of grantee outcomes.</p>
<p>&bull; The process evaluation is intended to: <br />o Make explicit the process used by NIDRR to develop its funding priorities and conduct peer reviews of applications; and <br />o Document how selected grantees manage NIDRR grants to ensure the quality of research and development products.</p>
<p>&bull; The summative review of grantee outcomes is intended to:<br />o Provide data for GPRA measures and the PART process; <br />o Provide a better understanding of the products developed by NIDRR grantees; <br />o Provide a quality review of the final outcomes; and<br />o Inform future research priorities.</p>
<p>The process evaluation will be conducted through interviews with key NIDRR and grantee staff. The summative review of grantee outcomes will be conducted through web-conferences with a random sample of grantees that are in the final year of their grant.</p>
<p>NAS&nbsp;will develop an evaluation plan, a sampling strategy, and the review questions for the process evaluation and the criteria for the summative reviews. Upon completion,&nbsp;NAS will submit an evaluation report presenting the findings from both the process evaluation and summative review.</p>
<p>The authority permitting other than full and open competition is 6.302-1. The Department will afford qualified and interested parties an opportunity to submit capablity statements outlining experience directly relevant to this requirement. The Government will consider information received within 30 days of this synopsis.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Laboratory of Translational Genetics intends to procure on a sole source basis the TaqMan Human microRNA Array A &amp; B with Applied Biosystems, 850 Lincoln Centre Drive, Foster City, CA 94404.<br /> <br />This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-(b)(1).  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 325413 and the business size standard is 500.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.</p>
<p>The overall goal of our laboratory is to develop new approaches to the study of the genetic basis of cancer and its outcomes. Specifically, we will investigate the genetic basis of strong association signals identified in candidate gene association studies, loci identified by linkage analyses in high-risk families, or genome-wide association studies (GWAS), particularly the loci identified by the ongoing Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) program.  This research utilizes molecular biology immunological, genetic and biochemical technologies.  The contractor shall provide 50 Taqman MicroRNA Assay Array Cards.</p>
<p>Salient Characteristics required of the TaqMan Human microRNA Array A &amp; B are:</p>
<p>1.	Reaction vessel uses microfluidic technology in a 384-well plate format.<br />2.	The reaction vessel has 8 sample loading ports and must use centrifugation to distribute the samples into each of the 48 wells serviced by each port.<br />3.	The reaction vessel is compatible with the Applied Biosystems 7900HT Sequence Detection System (a real-time PCR instrument).<br />4.	The reaction vessel is pre-loaded with pre-designed 5'-nuclease assays using TaqMan&reg; probes.</p>
<p><br />Applied Biosystems is the only known source for the TaqMan MicroRNA Assay Array <br />Cards.  Use of a different platform would result in a decrease of sensitivity and<br />specificity.  Further, alternate platforms would require procurement of additional costly<br />equipment.</p>
<p>Applied Biosystems technology is the only real time quantitative PCR method authorized to use microRNA TaqMan for:<br />a.	   High specificity (single base pair discrimination of mature miRNA); <br />b.	Sensitivity (single copy of target)<br />c.	   Linear Dynamic Range (7-9 logs of linear dynamic range)<br />d.	Ease of use: Easily implementable on existing 7900HT, with only 2 steps that take approximately 3-10 minutes total hands on time average per sample when operating in high throughput (15-30 minutes per sample hands on time in low throughput vs hours with microarrays)<br />e.	  Low sample input: Ability to assess single cells or low cell population (Non-biased assessment of single cells with the TaqMan Array). Ability to do Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM), FFPE (Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded) tissues, and every other tissue with minimally 1 cell and no limitation on abundent sample.<br />f.	  Highly parallel miRNA profiling/detection</p>

<SUBJECT>Request for Information (RFI) - Privately Operated Commercially Remote Sensing Satellites
<SOLNBR>RFI-9-00000
<RESPDATE>081409
<CONTACT>Robin L. Prather, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-713-3478 x175, Fax 301-713-4155, Email robin.prather@noaa.gov
<DESC><p>This RFI is published for research purposes only. It seeks to obtain information from business concerns, including 8(a) or small business concerns of the U.S. space industry on all types (Electro-Optical, Synthetic Aperture Radar, Hyperspectral, LIDAR, etc.) of privately-operated commercially remote sensing satellites. The Government will not award a contract based on the responses to this notice, but wants to obtain information or capabilities for planning purposes. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.
<p>Under the authority of The Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has been delegated the responsibility for licensing privately-operated U.S. remote sensing satellites. National Security Presidential Directive 27 issued in 2003 states that "U.S. companies are encouraged to build and operate commercial remote sensing space systems whose operational capabilities, products, and services are superior to any current or planned foreign commercial systems."</p>
<p>NOAA is engaging its government partners in a series of Interagency discussions on the most pragmatic approach to future licensing decisions. These discussions would be facilitated by inputs on the subject from U.S. industry, including those companies capable of developing remote sensing satellite and ground hardware as well as current, or future licensed commercial data providers.</p>
<p>Given that appropriate protections must remain in place to mitigate national security and foreign policy concerns, the Interagency has asked what government/industry initiatives might best support a business case for privately-operated commercially remote sensing systems. The U.S. industry can inform and educate the Interagency on the business challenges in this arena by addressing the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Is industry fully aware of the current licensing conditions that have been drafted for privately-operated systems? If so, would eliminating or modifying any of these conditions provide sufficient incentive to warrant proceeding with a system?</p>
<p>2. It is widely recognized that there is substantial government involvement in all the foreign "commercial" satellite systems. Barring direct subsidies, what form of U.S. government involvement (e.g., pre-launch data buys, service level agreements, access to technology, etc.) would provide sufficient incentives for a U.S. provider to operate a system?</p>
<p>3. Given the current state of the commercial marketplace for data, products and services, what attributes of a system might be exploitable by a U.S. market entrant in the next 5 years? Would or should these attributes be of interest to U.S. civil, military and/or intelligence agencies? Do these particular attributes have genuine commercial applications?</p>
<p>4. Does industry have suggestions for protecting national security that does not place the U.S. commercial remote sensing industry at a competitive disadvantage with respect to foreign competitors?</p>
<p>Responses should not exceed 20 pages. Please include a soft copy and include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, phone/fax/email, and business size and status (e.g., small business, 8(a) small disadvantaged business, women owned small business, etc.). Any questions regarding this announcement must be submitted in writing. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.</p>
<p>NOAA's Commercial Remote Sensing Regulatory Affairs Office (CRSRAO) is dedicated to maintaining an environment for licensing private remote sensing operators such that the goals articulated in NSPD-27 can be realized. If your response to this RFI requires special protection for company proprietary information, please indicate this clearly in your response. Please submit responses by 5:00 p.m. EST Friday, August 14, 2009 to:</p>
<p>Robin Prather<br />Robin.Prather@noaa.gov<br />1315 East-West Highway<br />SSMC3 Room 10100<br />Silver Spring, MD 20910</p>

<DESC><p>The Department of Commerce's (DOC) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has issued this Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for a Ground Segment Antenna System to support the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites R series (GOES-R) Program. This DRAFT RFP is not a solicitation, but is published as a planning instrument and as a means of soliciting industry comments for use in developing the final RFP which will be released at a future date.</p>
<p>NOAA's primary environmental mission is to provide weather forecasts and warnings for the United States, its territories, adjacent waters and ocean area, for the protection of life and property and the enhancement of the national economy. Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) allow for constant observations of the Earth's environment from geostationary orbit. These observations provide data for environmental phenomena affecting ecosystems, climate forecasts, weather and water, and supporting the safe and efficient operation of the Nation's transportation and commerce systems for the National economy.</p>
<p><br />The NOAA National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) procurement of the next-generation series of GOES (GOES-R) will replace the current GOES I and N-series satellites. The GOES R-series satellites are required to sustain capabilities through 2027. Due to lifetime probability predictions for the current GOES I and N-series, a GOES-R launch is required in the 2015 timeframe to maintain mission data continuity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />The Ground Antenna System is being procured in a contract separate from the GOES-R Satellite and Ground Segment contracts. The Ground Antenna System includes the design, fabrication, and test of six (6) new antenna stations and the upgrade of four (4) antenna stations. The antenna stations will be installed at three different sites: Wallops, Virginia (three new antenna stations); Suitland, Maryland (four antenna station upgrades); and a Remote Backup site in the vicinity of Fairmont, West Virginia (three new antenna stations). The new antenna stations will require operability with the GOES-R satellites and be backward- compatible with the current GOES I and N-series satellites.</p>
<p><br />The Government intends to acquire the Ground Segment Antenna System products and services through full and open competition conducted under FAR Part 15.&nbsp; The Government envisions the award of a single contract.</p>
<p><br />All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the Government. A site tour of the NOAA Satellite Operations Facility (NSOF) in Suitland is anticipated on or about June 22, 2009. A site tour of the Wallops Command and Data Acquisition Station (WCDAS) is anticipated on or about July 9, 2009. The anticipated release date of the Final RFP is on or about August&nbsp;2009.&nbsp; The anticipated award date is April 2010.&nbsp;</p>

Project Description:

This is an Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) opportunity at the Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division Memphis Detachment’s William B. Morgan Large Cavitation Channel (LCC) in Memphis, TN.  The project property is located on President’s Island at the Port of Memphis, about five miles from downtown Memphis, and is a part of a larger site, which is used as a Navy testing facility for model testing of all types of ship, submarine, and torpedo propellers and hulls.

The Navy is interested in leasing a total of 48.0 acres, consisting of approximately 172,000 square feet of warehouse space, an office building of approximately 17,550 square feet and approximately 37.4 acres of vacant land.  (The entire warehouse is approximately 461, 218 square feet with a ceiling height ranging from 35 feet to 108 feet.)  The 172,000 square feet of warehouse space available for the EUL will need to be separated from the rest of the building.  Use(s) of the warehouse space will have to be compatible with the LCC testing mission and requirements.

Competitive Process:
The Government intends to award the EUL using a two-phased, best value source selection process.  Specific source selection procedures, submission requirements, evaluation criteria and the obligations and responsibilities of the successful offeror are identified in Request for Qualifications (RFQ) LO-10226.  

Among other things, the successful offeror shall:

-	Develop a successful, long-term, mutually beneficial business relationship with the Navy while maintaining positive relations with local government authorities and the adjacent communities;
-	Design and develop the available real estate in a manner that is compatible with adjacent Government uses;
-	Execute, operate, and manage the development consistent with best commercial practices. 

The successful offeror shall provide the Navy in-kind consideration not less than the fair market value of the offeror’s leasehold interest in the real property.  No Government appropriated funds will be obligated by the EUL.

RFQ LO-10226:  
The RFQ is issued as an attachment to this Announcement.  The RFQ is also available on the Navy’s Enhanced Use Lease website at http://www.navyeul.com/projects/large_cavitation_channel/docs.php.  While the Navy intends to enter into a Lease with an Offeror selected through the process set forth in the RFQ, the Navy is under no obligation to do so.  The Navy reserves the right to cancel this RFQ at any time or to reject any and all submissions prepared in response to the RFQ.  The RFQ does not commit the Government to contract for services, or to pay any costs incurred in preparation of any submission in response to the RFQ.  

All questions, clarification requests and general information requests regarding the RFQ must be submitted, in writing, to Ms. Tammy Sadler, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Atlantic, 6506 Hampton Boulevard, Norfolk, VA  23508, tammy.sadler@navy.mil or (757) 322-4927.

<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory intends to negotiate a contract on the basis of other than Full and Open Competition IAW10 USC 2304 (c)(1), only one responsible source.  NRL will negotiate with L-3 Communications Wescam, 649 North Service Road, Burlington, Ontario Canada L7P 5B9 for integration of customized EOM sensor assembly into existing NRL-owned WESCAM Ball Turret System, obtaining technical guidelines from WESCAM to allow compatibility between NRL-generated technology with their product, testing as well as procurement of additional systems.  The systems will be used in NRL OSD’s Airborne Reconnaissance Program.  The following demonstrates the proposed contractor’s unique qualifications or nature of the required use of the authority cited previous:  

From a technical standpoint, the Wescam mounts have the pointing accuracy needed to match the requirements of NRL-developed payloads. They can be configured with a larger internal volume needed to contain these payloads than can be provided by other potential vendors due to a proprietary internal axis configuration (“Virtual Cardan”).  The track record and reliability of these turrets under extreme and harsh conditions is unique in the industry.  Because of this, they are by far the most widely used stabilized systems in both commercial, law-enforcement and DOD applications.

Because of a combination of physical size, performance, Wescam engineering and manufacturing capabilities and adaptability, the Naval Research Laboratory has developed a significant set of capabilities specifically designed for use with Wescam stabilized platforms.  This involves over ten million dollars and tens of man-years of in-house and contractor development, both software and hardware, that is compatible only with the Wescam mounts.  In addition, these mounts are used extensively in operational DOD systems as systems of record making them the most cost-effective and efficient path to deployment.  

To our knowledge, no other ball turret system exists that could be used to integrate with the NRL components without a large expenditure of time, effort, and money to perform the NRE and integration tasks that are already completed for current WESCAM MX ball turret systems.  NRL’s systems have been developed based upon complex interfaces to Wescam’s proprietary software and hardware.

The response to this notice of intent to negotiate with L-3 Communications Wescam should be submitted no later than 45 days from date of synopsis.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) intends to award a purchase order for one base year and two option years to Alaska Ecoscience, 2332 Cordes Way, Fairbanks, AK  99709 for the conduct of field work, data analysis, and the writing of field reports and publications.  The study is on the causes and consequences of coastal erosion in Western Alaska: implications for wetlands and migratory birds.  Work to be conducted on the outer Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska, near the monitoring sites in the drainages of the middle and lower sections of the Kashunuk (6123'04N x 16529'03W), Tutakoke (6114'50N x 16536'05W) and Manokinak (6113'34N x 16503'36W) Rivers.  Landscape monitoring and research to be integrated with spatially stratified habitat monitoring stations originally established by Torre Jorgenson of Alaska Ecoscience in 1994-1996.  Findings related to plant communities will be compared to the information collected in 1994-1996 (Jorgenson 200, Jorgenson and Ely 2001).  Work will also entail performing initial supervised classification of recently acquired IKONOS imagery.  Only entities familiar with the existing landscape plots can perform this effort because the exact sampling sites are difficult to locate and prior experience is required to minimize sampling error.  Previous experience at the same remote locations is required due to vagaries of photo interpretation of tundra habitats combined with the subtle temporal changes in habitat signatures. Environment is remote and harsh with access restricted to boat or aircraft.  Familiarity with this geographic region is key due to the potential risks of the field work and the great distances between villages.  Other interested concerns having the ability to provide the required services may submit a capability statement to the Contract Specialist no later than the closing date of this announcement at 13:00 hours California Pacific Daylight Time.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  All responses must be in writing to the Contract Specialist by email to jstevenson@usgs.gov  NAICS 541710.  Contact J Stevenson (916) 278-9344.  This notice is for informational purposes only.  This is not a request for competitive proposals.  The Government intends to award this requirement in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b) (1).

<SOLNBR>W912HN-09-R-0059
<CONTACT>Jennifer L. Murphy, Phone 912-652-6147, Email jennifer.l.murphy@usace.army.mil
<DESC><p>GC09-6, GA/SC GENERAL CONSTRUCTION MATOC</p>
<p>Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC), for Design/Build or Construction type task orders. Task orders issued under this MATOC can require performance of work anywhere within the South Atlantic Division Area of Operations (North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi). Projects will typically be located on military installations within Georgia and South Carolina; however, performance of work is not solely restricted to such. A project requiring use of civil funds or otherwise termed as "civil construction" is not authorized under this contract.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being offered as a small business set aside. The life of the basic contract is for a base period of three (3) years with two (2) one-year option periods or $499M; whichever occurs first. The pool size (number of contracts that may be awarded) shall not exceed six (6) contractors. The pool of contractors which successfully receive an award will share the total contract capacity of $499M. The government will use a two-phase design build evaluation process. The order limitation of task orders, to include the seed task order that will be used for evaluation purposes and award of the initial contract, shall range between $1M and $40M. Task orders issued under this MATOC will be firm-fixed price. The initial seed task order and follow on task orders may include options.</p>
<p>Description of work: Task orders placed under this MATOC may be either of a design-build nature or that of a design-bid-build (construction only) nature. Work may include, but is not limited to, repairs, renovations, alterations, and/or additions to existing buildings such as administrative, recreational, educational, religious, medical, and training type facilities as well as their corresponding support facilities, or infrastructure such as roads, parking, drainage systems, utility systems, and force protection. Work under this MATOC may also include the design and the construction of various types of facilities including but not limited to, administrative, recreational, educational, religious, medical, and training type as well as their corresponding support facilities. Generally, however, task orders anticipated to be issued under this MATOC will be primarily for new, vertical construction and associated site work.</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria: As this is a solicitation for a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC), a seed task order will be provided to those offerors invited to participate in Phase II for purposes of evaluation and in rendering the best value decision. Only that offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value of those offerors selected to be in the MATOC pool, if any, will also be awarded the seed task order. All other successful offerors, if any, will be awarded a contract with a minimum guarantee of $2,500. The evaluation factors and their relative importance for both Phase I and Phase II of this solicitation and evaluation process are as follows:</p>
<p>Phase I: Factor 1-1 CORPORATE RELEVANT SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE, Factor 1-2 PAST PERFORMANCE, and Factor 1-3 TECHNICAL APPROACH NARRATIVE. Factor 1-1 is more important than factors 1-2 and 1-3. Factor 1-2: is equal in importance to Factor 1-3. Factors 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, together are equal in importance to Factor 2-1.</p>
<p>Phase II: Factor 2-1, Building Function and Aesthetics. Factor 2-2, Quality of Building Systems. Factor 2-3, Site Design. Factor 2-4, Sustainable Design. Factor 2-5 PROPOSED CONTRACT DURATION AND SUMMARY SCHEDULE. Factor 2-6 SMALL AND SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS UTILIZATION. Factors 2-1: Equal in importance to all Phase 1 factors combined, slightly more important than Factor 2-2 and more important than Factors 2-3, 2-4, 2-5 and significantly more important than Factor 2-6. Factor 2-2: is more important than Factors 2-3, 2-4, 2-5 and significantly more important than Factor 2-6. Factor 2-3: is slightly more important than Factors 2-4 and 2-5 and more important then Factor 2-6. Factor 2-4: is slightly more important than Factor 2-5 and more important then Factor 2-6. FACTOR 2-5: is more important than Factor 2-6. FACTOR 2-6: is least important.</p>
<p>Price: All non-cost factors, when combined, are significantly more important than Price.</p>
<p>Award will be made to those Offerors whose technical submittal and price proposal contain the combination of the criteria requested that offers the best value to the Government. Proposals shall include sufficient detailed information to allow complete evaluation. The Government reserves the right to reject any and all offers. Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of proof of acceptability rests with the Offeror.</p>

<DESC><p>Mauritius: Feasibility Study on the CEB Transmission Grid and Transformer Network Monitoring System
<p>POC: John Kusnierek, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009. PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Chairman, Tender Committee; Central Electricity Board; Head Office; Royal Road; Curepipe, Mauritius; Phone +230 601 1100; Fax: +230 675 7958.</p>
<p>CEB Transmission Grid and Transformer Network Monitoring System. The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the CEB Transmission Grid and Transformer Network Monitoring System Project.</p>
<p>The Central Electricity Board (CEB) is a parastatal body established under the Ministry of Public Utilities (MPU) to carry out the development of electricity generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in Mauritius. CEB produces around 60% of the country's total power requirements, the remaining 40% being purchased from the bagasse - fueled generators of the island's sugar estates. CEB is now seeking independent power producers to help meet the country's growing demand, and are currently placing a strong emphasis on upgrading their transmission infrastructure and transformer network. With an annual production capacity of 2.35 billion kWh, annual consumption of 2.07 billion kWh, and economic growth rate of 5.4%, the Mauritian power grid is already operating at the edge of its capacity and can expect steady growth in demand as the nation's economy continues to grow. Thus, the CEB is seeking more efficient ways to identify weaknesses and power loss in their transmission system as they work to expand the country's generation capacity.</p>
<p>This system will also allow the Grantee to define modes of operation for the various operating states of the electrical network. These modes are used to adapt the grid's operation to address current conditions, i.e. normal operation, high load operations, and localized outages, as occur during the area's frequent cyclones. The Grantee is seeking a system that will collect data from the multiple substations around the island, integrated systems components, devices and disparate resources, and continuously monitor the grid's operational state compared to established model parameters.</p>
<p>In addition to making recommendations concerning the implementation of a software monitoring system, the Study shall evaluate the current condition of the transmission network with emphasis on substation transformers. This analysis shall provide a basis for planning equipment replacement and upgrades needed to maintain efficient grid operation and expansion to meet growing demands for access to additional power.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $ 325,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp. Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 13:30 local time, August 26, 2009 at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<CONTACT>Liz Hammond, Contract Specialist , Phone 4107867440, Email elizabeth.hammond@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC><p><br />Examination Engagement for Review of Medicare Advantage Organizations and Prescription Drug Plans' Financial Information
<p>THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.</p>
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of companies (small, and/or disadvantaged) that are qualified to support CMS in the examination engagements for the review of the Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs) and Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs).</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>From the beginning of the Medicare program in 1965, Medicare has recognized the unique nature of Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) and HMO-like entities and has provided for alternative payment methodologies appropriate for such organizations. The original Medicare amendments to the Social Security Act included the authority for prepaid plans to receive payments for physician services on a basis other than individual charges. Even before the enactment of the federal HMO Act in 1973, the 1972 amendments to the Social Security Act provided authority to contract with HMOs on a risk-sharing basis and on a cost basis.</p>
<p>In 1996, Section 202 of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) added section 1893, to the Social Security Act. Section 1893 established the Medicare Integrity Program (MIP). MIP was established to strengthen CMS's ability to deter waste, fraud and abuse in the Medicare program. It provides for separate and stable long term funding for MIP activities. MIP expands CMS's contracting authority so the agency can more aggressively carry out program safeguard functions.</p>
<p>The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) established the Medicare+Choice (M+C) program, allowing additional types of managed care organizations to secure Medicare contracts. A major intent of the BBA was to replace the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) with new managed care options (i.e. M+C plans, etc.) for beneficiaries. It allowed for new beneficiary options in addition to the well established types of HMO options operating under TEFRA contracts. <br />&emsp;<br />The recently-enacted Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) has expanded the role of private entities in providing benefits to Medicare beneficiaries. First, the law adds a new section to the Social Security Act, 1860D ("Part D") that offers prescription benefits beginning in 2006 through Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs). Secondly, the statute allows for payments to Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs) "local plans" formerly M+C plans, and creates a new type of private plan, "Regional" MA plans or Regional Preferred Provider Organizations (RPPOs).</p>
<p>CMS's Office of Financial Management (OFM) has overall responsibility for the fiscal integrity of all Agency programs which includes the mandated one-third financial audit requirement. OFM will conduct annual audits of the financial records of at least one third of the MAOs and PDPs as required by Sections 1857(d)(1) and 1860D-12 of the Social Security Act.</p>
<p>Description of work:</p>
<p>The main objectives of the examinations are to provide assurance that Medicare Advantage and Prescription Drug payments were proper and organizations' self reported information used to determine payment amounts were valid and correct. The audit contractor shall document the results of the examination, extrapolate the value of appropriate exceptions to the entire population and propose payment adjustments.</p>
<p>The examination engagements shall be made in accordance with the Uniform Examination Program (UEP) for the Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAO) and Prescription Drug Plans (PDP) which, includes:</p>
<p>&bull; Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB)</p>
<p>&bull; Generally Accepted Accounting Procedures (GAAP)</p>
<p>&bull; Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS)</p>
<p>&bull; Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS).</p>
<p>&bull; American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)</p>
<p>&bull; General Accounting Office Government Auditing Standards <br />(2007 revision, Yellow Book)</p>
<p>&bull; Social Security Act (the Act) Titles XVIII and XIX and; the Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) governing the MAO program including, standards and processes for imposing the enforcement provisions.</p>

<p>The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) was passed in September 1982 in which Congress mandated the provision of managed care plan options to Medicare beneficiaries. The statute allowed Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in HMOs reimbursed on a cost basis (also known as MCOs) or "risk-contracting" HMOs. HMOs reimbursed on a cost basis are reimbursed for "reasonable cost" incurred for Medicare covered services rendered, related administration on those medical services, plan administration, and a defined special administration. The special administration is reimbursed 100%.</p>
<p>In 1996, Section 202 of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) added section 1893, to the Social Security Act. Section 1893 established the Medicare Integrity Program (MIP). MIP was established to strengthen CMS's ability to deter waste, fraud and abuse in the Medicare program.

<p>Description of work:</p>
<p>The objective of the agreed-upon procedure review is to determine whether reimbursable costs claimed by the managed care organization are reasonable, allowable, and allocable in accordance with applicable Medicare laws and regulations.</p>
<p>In addition, the contractor shall evaluate the MCO's Medical Review programs and make recommendations for improvement. The review includes, but is not limited to, the review of the MCO procedures and internal controls over duplicate payments and situations when Medicare is a Secondary Payer (MSP).

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Nuclear Safety, Quality Assurance and Environment (HS-20), intends to award a sole source contract to Doxcelerate Corporation of New Mexico to renew an existing software license and maintenance agreement for the DOE RevCom Technical Standards Program.  Doxcelerate Corporation is the owner and developer of the software and has proprietary rights to the software.  This activity supports the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 which requires reducing the number of paper-driven processes.  The North American Industry Classification Systems Code for this requirement is 541511.  The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) (ii).  This is a notice of intent and not a request for competitive proposals.  No solicitation is available for this requirement.  Interested parties should submit a capability statement and pricing informatio n for the requirement within 15 calendar days of publication of this notice, to be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. This is NOT a solicitation for proposal, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of 8a Small Business firms, HUBZone Small Business firms and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business firms; (2) whether they are 8a Small Businesses, HUBZONE Small Businesses, or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered an 8a Small Business, HUBZONE Small Business, or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business should not submit a response to this notice. 

BACKGROUND:

The Office of Research Integrity (ORI) promotes integrity in biomedical and behavioral research supported by the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) at about 4,000 institutions worldwide. ORI monitors institutional investigations of research misconduct and facilitates the responsible conduct of research (RCR) through educational, preventive, and regulatory activities.

In accordance with its directive to foster integrity in PHS funded research, the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) is continuing the Research Integrity & Education Program and Assurance Program. The importance of instruction in the responsible conduct of research (RCR) was first formally recognized in an Institute of Medicine Report in 1989 and quickly translated into policy through an NIH/ADAMHA Training Grant Requirement. Since that time, research institutions have adopted a wide range of approaches to RCR instruction, from campus information campaigns to seminars, lectures, courses, and, most recently, web- based programs. While it is understood that research institutions have a responsibility to assure that their researchers are provided appropriate instruction in RCR, experimenting with innovative approaches assessing the efficacy of different ways of offering instruction adds burdens to institutes at a time when research dollars are stretched. ORI’s Research Integrity and Education Program is designed to relieve some of these burdens by providing continuing funds to foster national efforts to develop effective curriculum modules, resources, and assessment tools that can be used by a broad number of institutes.

In FY08, ORI engaged the creation of a Virtual Experience Immersive Learning Simulation (VEILSTM) focusing on research misconduct.  The final product will be a computer-based program in which users view video snippets and make decisions for characters in the video.  Based on the decision-making of the user, the video will proceed to a corresponding storyline.  Four “playable” characters will be available in the end-product; a graduate student, a post-doc, a principal investigator, and a research integrity officer. 

An ORI contractor is currently completing the research and development of the script for the VEILS on research misconduct.

PURPOSE AND PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:

The purpose of the contract will be to provide services that will take the completed VEILS script to production. The services include: Script Review; Talent Audition; Rehearsal; Identifying Film Settings; Performing all video capturing for the final product; Voice-Over Recording; Video Editing; Collate video, voiceover, text screens and additional elements into a four playable-character interactive movie contextual adventure; Integrate the video into VEILS which is patented by WILL Interactive, Inc.; Create a DVD-version of the VEILS; Beta test the prototype with ORI-assigned subject matter experts; Debug and revise the product based on subject matter expert review; Provide a web-based version of VEILS that is compatible with the ORI server for web distribution; Create 7,000 DVD copies of the VEILS; and mail approximately 6,000 DVD copies to research institutes.
	
DELIVERABLES:

Deliverables that will be required during contract performance: (1) Detailed project plan based on the kickoff meeting as well as a kickoff meeting report; (2) Weekly email reports; (3) Profiles of potential talent for casting; (4) Final list of talent; (5) Alpha Version Prototype; (6) Beta Version Prototype; (7) Final Version; (8) Seven Thousand (7,000) VEILS DVDs; and (9) Final Report.

ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:

The anticipated period of performance is twelve months from date of award. The anticipated start date is September 30, 2009.

<CONTACT>Tammy Lee Bair, Contract Specialist, Email tammy.bair@socom.mil - Craig Bowers, Contracting Officer, Email bowersc@socom.mil
<DESC><p>The USSOCOM is requesting information from appropriate companies or parties currently capable of developing and fielding a submarine-launched, free-flooding, Shallow Water Combat Submersible (SWCS) vehicle that will provide Special Operation Forces (SOF) continued operational capability to conduct SOF shallow water undersea operations similar to those currently performed on the MK 8 MOD 1 SEAL Delivery Vehicle (SDV).&nbsp; The SWCS must address a wide range of operational challenges including the growing ability of hostile nations to detect, identify and target SOF conducting undersea tasks.&nbsp; Broad industry participation is desired but USSOCOM is keenly interested in designs that are currently in production or capable of rapidly entering into production.&nbsp; Delivery date of first production unit is planned in 2015.&nbsp; To complete the study and consider programming initiatives in the fiscal year 2010 Program Objective Memorandum (POM), USSOCOM requires current industry sources and capabilities information.</p>
<p>1. PURPOSE:&nbsp; This notice is part of Government Market Research, a process for obtaining the latest information on the &lsquo;art of the possible' from industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities.&nbsp; All company proprietary information contained in the response shall be separately marked.&nbsp; Any proprietary information contained in response to this request will be properly protected from unauthorized disclosure.&nbsp; The government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one firm to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition so as to not inadvertently restrict competition.</p>
<p>2. OBJECTIVES:&nbsp; The objectives of this Request for Information (RFI) are to identify responsible sources and interested parties who have proven solutions that can meet or exceed SWCS requirements.&nbsp; PMS NSW is interested in identifying sources that have the capability of designing and producing a manned underwater submersible including long term on-site Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) provided by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and a logistics manager in Oahu, Hawaii.&nbsp; The plan is to produce one engineering model and 10 production units.&nbsp; For the purpose of this RFI, the term "proven" means solutions at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) "6" or higher, preferably TRL "7" or higher that has been validated in their relevant or operational environment.&nbsp; Examples would be testing in a high fidelity laboratory which emulates the undersea environment or actual system prototype testing in a surface or subsurface environment.</p>
<p>3. BACKGROUND: The MK 8 MOD 1 SEAL Delivery Vehicle (SDV) is approaching the end of its service life.&nbsp; The system was originally designed around a standard 1553 data bus, making upgrades and replacements no longer cost effective due to obsolescence. &nbsp;In some cases, increased capability may be available but the lack of an open architecture prevents cost effective upgrade of the systems.&nbsp; The SWCS is the next generation SDV and is an ACAT III program at Milestone A with a Milestone B determination scheduled for third quarter FY10. &nbsp;The SWCS will require development of an IBS with an open architecture, a power and signal distribution system capable of integrating various electronic systems and sensors, and the capability to display operational data to the vehicle pilot and navigator.&nbsp; Increased crew and cargo capacities and endurance are required. In order to meet these requirements, new technologies which provide increased Hull Mechanical and Electrical (HM&amp;E) efficiencies are required.</p>
<p>4. OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS: The new SWCS will perform clandestine transport of SOF personnel and equipment in a wet environment into littoral waters and harbors.&nbsp; The SWCS must address a wide range of operational challenges including the growing ability of hostile nations to detect, identify and target SOF conducting undersea tasks.&nbsp; Thus, the SWCS shall have a modular open architecture design conducive to accommodating upgrades to processors and sensors.&nbsp; Operating in a free-flooding "wet" vehicle, the SWCS passengers and crew transit for extended durations (i.e. up to 12 hours) in a wet, variant temperature environment while breathing from SCUBA gear.&nbsp; Thus hardware and software selected must feature interfaces that are mission centric to ensure required operator actions are simple and minimized.</p>
<p>5. REQUIREMENTS: &nbsp;Following general, unclassified system requirements are applicable:</p>
<p><br />A) Launch and Recovery:<br />The SWCS will be capable of launch and recovery from surface vessels and from submerged host platforms. &nbsp;The submerged launch and recovery platform is the Dry Deck Shelter (DDS) which is mounted external to a submarine host platform aft of the sail.<br />B) External Boundaries:<br />The SWCS must be loaded, manned, and maintained while enclosed in the DDS.&nbsp; The total available volume inside the DDS is 8 feet diameter by 22 feet long from the bubble window operator station to the apex of the elliptical outer door.<br />C) Internal Crew and Cargo Volume:<br />The SWCS will be fully operable with a crew of two, and it will provide useable space for additional passengers and cargo. &nbsp;Dedicated crew/passenger cargo volume shall be maximized for transport of SOF personnel and equipment.<br />D) Breathing Air System Capacity:<br />The crew and passengers will wear closed-circuit Underwater Breathing Apparatus (UBA) for primary life support.&nbsp; The SWCS will have an auxiliary open-circuit breathing system capable of sustaining 6 divers for 1.25 hrs at 25 FSW and 8.75 hrs at 15 FSW before recharging.<br />E) Vehicle Signatures<br />All signatures, including acoustic, magnetic, infrared, and visual, shall be minimized. <br />F) Ballast and Trim<br />The SWCS shall have the capability to adjust ballast and trim to accommodate 400 lbs of payload to achieve neutral buoyancy and level trim.<br />G) Speed and Range<br />The SWCS will be designed to maximize cruise speed and transit range via hydrodynamic optimization, motor and propeller selection, and battery design.<br />H) Deep Submergence Systems Requirements<br />In order to be taken aboard the DDS, the SWCS must comply with Carry-On requirements for submarines. <br />I) Vehicle Control<br />The SWCS shall be designed to permit a single diver to operate all subsystems associated with piloting, ballasting and trimming, and otherwise controlling the motions and behavior of the vehicle from one diver station. <br />J) Automatic Vehicle Control<br />Automatic pilot and automatic ballast and trim functions are desired.<br />K) Transportability<br />The SWCS hull design must be durable enough to be lifted out of the water or on land for transport <br />L) NET-Ready: <br />100% of interfaces, services, policy-enforcement controls, and data correctness, availability and processing requirements designated as enterprise-level or critical in the Joint integrated architecture. <br />M) Force Protection/Survivability:<br />SWCS shall have the ability to detect threats equal to or better than the MK8 MOD 1 SDV technologies. <br />N) Navigation Accuracy: <br />The navigation system will allow safe and accurate navigation, to include an integrated precision navigation system such as a Doppler navigation system augmented by Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) Compliant GPS. <br />O) Diver-to-Diver, Diver-to-SWCS, and SWCS-to-Host Communications: <br />Secure LPI/LPD Tethered underwater communications systems linking Diver-to-Diver, Diver-to SWCS, and SWCS-to-Host. <br />P) Performance &amp; Mission Availability: <br />10 twelve-hour missions without a critical failure with 0.90 reliability over 10 days of use in a 30-day period.<br />Q) Sensor Mast: <br />SWCS will include a sensor mast with an open-architecture, allowing the plug-n-play integration of various imaging sensors. <br />R) Docking System:<br />Rendezvous system shall support manual docking to Host.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Institute of Standards and Technology intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)with Progress Software Corporation,14 Oak Park Drive, Bedford, MA 01730-1485,to provide Progress Software’s ObjectStore database engine, to integrate existing and planned components of NIST, MET’s Enterprise Information Systems-CIMS. MEP has developed CIMS using the Java Enterprise Edition standard employing an object-oriented database management system and application development techniques. The system uses MEP’s application server of choice BEA Systems Weblogic Server.  This approach required making the application server totally independent from the database, which resulted in the need for an in-memory persistent cache. Only ObjectStore provides both complete integration with Weblogic Application Server and support for in-memory persistent caching. Without ObjectStore, MEP will not be able to maintain CIMS. This is priority software only available with Progress Software.  
A fixed price purchase order will be issued on or about June 24, 2008, and the period of performance shall be July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2009.

The workshop is in response to a Staff Requirements Memorandum that directs NRC staff to promptly conduct a public workshop to receive stakeholder input on the limited rulemaking planned to address regulation of depleted uranium.  

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as implemented by Subpart 6.302-1 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), which provides for limiting competition in those situations where the supplies or services are available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy NRC's requirements

In accordance with the above-referenced memorandum, the NRC would like to promptly host a two-day workshop in Rockville, Maryland, in September of 2009 for approximately 200 people. However, several factors preclude the scheduling of the two-day workshop during any other time period than September 1, 2009, through September 3, 2009.  As a result of this limited time period, NRC staff was required to contact off-site venues for the workshop to determine their availability.  One additional site was found to be available; however, due to the level of senior staff who will participate in this workshop, the close proximity of the North Bethesda Marriott is crucial.  The North Bethesda Marriott is only .1 miles from Headquarters and does not require that NRC staff use Metrorail farecards and expend additional time for Metrorail travel because other hotels are not easily accessible by the NRC shuttle.  Senior level management and Commissioner level staff need to be able to return to the NRC should emergency arise.  The stakeholders at the workshop will greatly benefit from being able to interact with such high levels at the NRC where NRC staff may remain unencumbered by their daily activities. Therefore, the more readily available access to the North Bethesda Marriott from NRC outweighs the time and cost associated with commuting to and from other potentially available hotels.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 721110. This notice of intent is neither a request for proposal nor a solicitation of offers. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to the notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities and any other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the NRC’s needs. Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the above address not later than 9 calendar days from the date this announcement appears in the Federal Business Opportunities. Telephonic responses and responses providing insufficient information for evaluation by the NRC will not be considered.

<DESC>On a SOLE-SOURCE basis, the Bureau of Transportation Research (BTS), within the Research and Special Programs Administration (RITA), within the U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT), plans to issue a SOLE-SOURCE contract or delivery order or purchase order to DLT Solutions, Inc. (DLT), to pay for software maintenance by DLT.  The maintenance covers technical support and updates for the Toad for Oracle (Toad) software, which is part of the RITA Enterprise Architecture.  The maintenance is renewed on an annual basis.  The estimated cost for this procurement (covering Federal Fiscal Year 2009) is $7,825.48.   RITA’s Office of Information Technology currently manages the Toad software licenses for RITA and BTS.  This software is used to perform data management and data analysis on databases maintained by RITA.  Some of these are high visibility databases for programs such as airline data, the Census of Ferries, and others.  Without support, maintenance, and product upgrades, the capability of key BTS and RITA projects to sustain production through various data management and analysis needs that Toad provides would be severely handicapped and in many cases would delay entire projects and / or programs.  DLT acts as the coordinator for Toad Maintenance for Federal customers.  DLT has been the sole GSA vendor for this product since February 10, 2009.  Quest Software, Inc. is the sole manufacturer of such Toad for Oracle software, and Quest has designated DLT as the sole Federal provider of maintenance for Quest’s Toad for Oracle software.  Therefore, DLT is believed to be the only available source for providing the needed software maintenance.  

The software items to be maintained by DLT under this procurement are as follows:

1.  TOAD FOR ORACLE PER SEAT MAINTENANCE RENEWAL, 12/31/07 – 12/31/09

2.  TOAD for Oracle Standard Edition Per Seat Maintenance Renewal Pack, 12/15/08 – 12/31/09.  ALL RENEWAL MAINTENANCE GOOD THROUGH 12/31/09 (DLT 3191342, QQ 1-51E0LZ)

HOWEVER, any company or organization other than DLT, which believes that it is capable of providing such software maintenance services to RITA / BTS at the high level of quality and efficiency that is indispensable to RITA / BTS, may e-mail, to Mr. James Mowery, a Statement of Qualifications, which must be received by Mr. Mowery at james.mowery@dot.gov  not later than 4:15 PM Eastern Daylight Time July 2, 2009.  HOWEVER, any company or organization that is contemplating the submission of such a Statement of Qualifications should bear in mind that the company or organization would not ultimately be able to defeat DLT in a competitive procurement for the needed software maintenance services without later proving (in a full-blown proposal) that the company or organization is the best buy for RITA / BTS, taking into consideration not only technical factors and quality factors but also pricing factors and past performance factors.

As such, the target audience is telemetry and wired/wireless network vendors/manufacturers. The purpose of this event is to increase awareness of contracting opportunities in support of the iNET Project.<BR><BR>Recognizing the inability of current telemetry technology to meet emergent needs within the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB), the Department of Defense (DoD) Test Resource Management Center (TRMC), via the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (http://www.acq.osd.mil/trmc/jipp/cteip/index.htm), launched the iNET Project. The iNET Project has taken a systems engineering approach to create an architecture and a set of standards to enhance traditional aeronautical telemetry via networking. <BR><BR>iNET Industry Days will focus on the planned Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) scheduled for release in the fall of 2009.  The Government anticipates there will be a total of $7M to $10M funding for more than 10 individual efforts. The overall objective of this planned BAA is to:<BR><BR>" Prototype and/or simulate components compliant with the emerging iNET standards. Initial versions of the standards will be publically available prior to the BAA release.<BR>" Reduce risk for a planned Request for Proposal (RFP) to deploy iNET at multiple MRTFB sites. It is anticipated that a draft RFP will be released in the fall of 2010.<BR><BR>Registration for this event is free. However, registration is limited to three (3) representatives from any organization. Those planning to attend must register by emailing full name and organization affiliation to the primary POC listed above. The deadline for registration is July 8th, 2009. Additionally, on the second day a limited number of 20-minute time slots are available for individual meetings (no more than three [3] organization representatives) with the iNET Project leadership. These meetings will provide participants the opportunity to further clarify understanding of iNET and its related standards.  Offerors are expressly prohibited from using the individual meetings to showcase their organization, products, or services (no sales pitches). To reserve one of these slots, contact the Primary POC listed above. Requests for individual meetings will be accommodated on a first-come-first-served basis and MUST be made via email. <BR><BR>Participation in Industry Days is NOT a requirement for future participation in any iNET BAA actions. <BR><BR>Please address any questions to the above listed point of contact.

Price<BR><BR>Technical and past performance, when combined, is significantly more important than  price.  <BR>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive simplified best value source selection in which competing offerors past performance history will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important to price considerations.  By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or subfactors.  All technically acceptable offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records.  Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable and therefore removed from further consideration.  Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<BR>A.	Technical Acceptability.  Initially, the government technical evaluation team shall evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis on each of the three technical aspects described below.  Failure in any one technical area shall constitute an overall rating of Unacceptable.  The Government shall assign an overall rating of Acceptable or Unacceptable as defined as follows:<BR><BR>Acceptable:  A proposal that passes all of the Governments requirements supported by technical elements. <BR>Unacceptable:  A proposal that fails any of the Governments supported by technical elements.                                                                                                          <BR>The proposals shall be evaluated against the following:<BR>Offerors must demonstrate acceptable technical approach to meeting 100% of the SOW requirements throughout contract period.  In order to receive a Pass rating that is technically acceptable, the offeror must clearly convey all of the following:<BR>(a)	A staffing and management approach that adequately addresses required labor required to perform catering services at the annual EUCOM event.<BR>(b)	A schedule that clearly shows all critical times associated with set up, sustainment, and break down of the event.  At a minimum the schedule shall detail when the cater will first arrive on the scene, when set up is to be completed, when full food and beverage services shall be operational, when breakdown and cleanup shall begin, and when the contractor shall vacate the premises.<BR>(c)	A menu that meets the minimum requirements as called for in the Statement of Work (food/beverage types and quantities).<BR><BR>Note:  Any vendor listed on the www.epls.gov (Excluded Parties Listing) is prohibited from receiving Government Awards..<BR>B.	Price Evaluation.  Next, the government shall rank all technically Acceptable offers by price.  An offerors proposed prices will be determined by looking at the overall proposed price of CLIN 0001.  The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price.<BR>C.	Past Performance Confidence Assessment.  Finally, the Government shall evaluate past performance on all offerors based on (1) the past and present efforts provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources.  <BR>D.	Relevant performance includes performance of efforts involving catering services that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.  Experience specifically gained by providing services on military installations for mixed military and civilian dignitaries shall be viewed more favorably than other catering service submittals.  The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offerors ability to perform the effort described in this RFP, based on the offerors demonstrated present and past performance. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment of Excellent, Good, Adequate, Marginal, Poor, or Unknown as defined in the Army Source Selection Manual Figure 5-5.  Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offerors performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating Unknown Confidence, meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.  Definitions are as follows:<BR><BR>Excellent:  Essentially no doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their performance record.  Risk Level: Very Low<BR>Good:  Little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their performance record.  Risk Level: Low<BR>Adequate:  Some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their performance record.  Risk Level: Moderate<BR>Marginal:  Significant doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their performance record.  Risk Level: High<BR>Poor:  It is extremely doubtful that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their performance record.  Risk Level: Very High<BR>Unknown:  The offeror has little/no relevant past performance upon which to base a meaningful performance risk prediction.  Risk Level: Unknown<BR>E.	In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this RFP.<BR>F.	If the lowest priced evaluated technically acceptable offer is judged to have an Excellent Confidence performance confidence assessment, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point.  Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.<BR>G.	The government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of Good or lower.  In that event, the Contracting Officer shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.<BR>H.	Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the RFP.  Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond.  Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system.  Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.	<BR>I.	The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors.  The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.<BR>Any proposal that does not meet all of the solicitation requirements will be rejected as nonresponsive and is un-awardable. <BR>The following FAR clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition: 52.252-1 -- Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference, 52.212-1  Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items, 52.212-2  Evaluation  Commercial Items, 52.212-3  Offerors Representations and CertificationsCommercial Items, DFARS 252.212-7000 Offeror Representations and CertificationsCommercial Items.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation document will not be issued.

This solicitation is a request for proposal (RFP). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-33.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 517210 Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except satellite), with a small business size standard of 1,500 employees.

The General Services Administration, Federal Acquisition Services, is seeking to purchase enhanced cellular service to multiple floors of Fritz G Lanham federal office building, 819 Taylor St., Fort Worth, TX. 76102.

All interested companies shall provide a technical/price proposal for the following:

2.0 Statement of Work:

The scope of this project is to design and install a micro-cell system to meet the functional requirements within the time constraints as required within this document.

The Contractor shall provide, install, test and certify an in-building Active Wireless Distributed Antenna system.  

The installed system shall enable AT&T 2G and 3G cellular services functionality on floors 1, 2, 3, and 4, totaling approximately 260,000 sq. ft. of required coverage area.  

The contractor designed system shall, with the assistance of AT&T personnel, connect to an AT&T provided RF source consisting of an Ericsson 2308 2G BTS and an Ericsson 3418 3G BTS.  This system shall be connected to multiple (5ea) T1 links which are to be provided by and configured by AT&T.  

The Contractor shall provide all ancillary equipment, cabling, fiber-optic cable, connections, terminations, personnel and technical expertise needed to ensure a fully functional micro-cell installation.     

The Contractor shall provide and install a wall mounted rack on existing backboard for the mounting of the contractor supplied Distributed Antenna System.  This mount shall be in wire closet 5-6 located on the 5th floor.  AT&T will provide connectivity to that closet for connection to the RF equipment, which will be installed in room 5A21.  
 
All cabling installed above the lowered ceilings shall be plenum rated.  Installed cabling shall be supported above the lowered ceilings by means of “bat-wing” or functionally similar devices ensuring cable does not rest on ceiling tiles or cross support structures.

All electronic and information technology (EIT) procured through this Statement of Work and any resulting contract must meet the applicable accessibility standards at 36CFR 1194, unless an agency exception to this requirement exists.  36 CFR 1194 implements Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and is viewable at http://www.section508.gov/.

Solicitation Number:  FDA1057307

Response Date: 30 June 2009

DESCRIPTION:

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES 13.5.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-32.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 611710 for full and open competition.  

1.	TITLE – 

Development of Information Management Processes, Balanced Scorecard and Performance Metrics for Public-Private Partnerships at FDA

2. BACKGROUND –

FDA’s mission to protect and promote public health is as grand as its jurisdiction.   To maintain the trust and the confidence of the public we serve—extending beyond regulatory roles—FDA must rise to the challenges of bridging scientific gaps—and be seen as an engaged partner rather than a barrier.  As the development path for all products under FDA’s watch has become increasingly inefficient and costly, non-traditional models of collaboration that leverage expertise and resources must be developed to tackle scientific problems and inform FDA’s regulatory decisions.  The current climate of scarce resources and high demands for cheaper, safer and more effective products creates an imperative need for strategic partnerships with FDA’s stakeholders.   Therefore, FDA will need to fortify and expand the scope of existing partnerships, develop novel business models and become more pro-active if it is to deliver on its responsibilities as leaders under the Department of Health and Human Services—thereby reinforcing FDA’s status as the gold standard regulatory authority.  FDA must pioneer new paths as it anticipates innovative technologies and new challenges.  

The Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Program Team within the Office of the Commissioner (OC), FDA is constituted operating under the Congressional mandate: Subchapter E of chapter V of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360bbb et seq.) and amended by: Legislation Authorizing public-private partnerships (PPP) at FDA under FDAAA, SEC. 566.  This PPP Program is dedicated to the mission of FDA through the creation and maintenance of partnerships among FDA and other agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services, academia, regulated industry, patient advocacy groups, professional organizations, and other similar interested stakeholders.  The PPP Program Team consists of highly trained scientific and administrative staff, located within the Immediate Office of the Commissioner, FDA and directed by the Senior Scientific Advisor, under the leadership of the Deputy Commissioner and Chief Scientist.

PPPs facilitate collaboration among FDA and stakeholders—working along aligned missions and under mutually beneficial goals—to address important cross-cutting scientific and public health needs, in a pre-competitive atmosphere.  Outcomes from these collaborations are transferred to the public domain for the benefit of all stakeholders.  As transparency and operational effectiveness are key elements of all activities at Federal agencies, this FDA PPP program incorporates inclusivity and critical public health needs.   Each area of focus must have performance metrics and meaningful outcomes that demonstrate a return on the taxpayer’s investments. PPPs represent a different mechanism of leveraging both public and private expertise and resources to bridge scientific gaps and address public health issues.  As such, many of the traditional performance metrics and outcome measures cannot fully quantify the results of creative programs—many of which are unprecedented in scope, timelines and deliverables—and new methods to capture information and measure progress are needed.  

Therefore, FDA seeks, under its Office of Scientific and Medical programs and its public health mission, to grant an award to for the development of performance metrics, a balanced scorecard and information management processes to sustain these PPPs and to facilitate meaningful reporting on the outcomes thereof.

 3. OBJECTIVES – State the objective(s) or desired results.  

PPP mechanisms create an environment where multiple stakeholders can assemble and pool resources and expertise in order to solve a common problem.

<p><strong>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p>This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualification for the required work. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) has a Compact with the Government of Benin. Among other things, the Compact provides funding for expansion and improvement of existing port facilities in the city of Cotonou and other physical and procedural improvements within the context of a program called Access to Markets. Now that a Compact (a binding agreement between governments) has been signed between the Government of the United States and the Government of Benin, MCC needs to retain the services to assist it in overseeing implementation of the Access to Markets Program (see attached Statement of Work for background and detailed description of work to be performed.) MCC intends to award a two-year Time and Materials Contract with an aggregate ceiling price. The period of performance shall be a Base Year period of twelve (12) months, with a one (1) year option period. North American Industrial Classification System code is 541330, which has a size standard of $4,500,000. This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size. If a large business is selected for the contract, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract. The current MCC subcontracting goals are 30% to Small Businesses, 5% to Woman Owned Small Business, 5% to Small Disadvantaged Business, 3% to Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, and 3% to HUBZone Small Business. This plan is not required with this submittal, but will be required with the price proposal of the firm selected for negotiations. The successful firm shall be precluded (FAR 9.5) from participating in follow on work and services (e.g., design, construction, and supervision) to be procured by MCA-Benin or designated Implementing Entities using funds advanced under the Compact with MCC. To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the DOD Central Contractor Registration (CCR).

<p>(I) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.5. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>

<p>(III) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32.</p>
<p>(IV) This solicitation is total small business set aside. The associated NAICS code is 331111. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial item(s)/services:</p>
<p>CLIN NO. 0001 - AISI-SAE 4340 Steel Bars, Quantity estimated at 7,000 lbs., in accordance with the following specifications.</p>
<p>CLIN NO. 0002 - 16 Ni CrMo13 Steel Bar - Quantity estimated at 250 to 300 lbs., in accordance with the following specifications.</p>
<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:</p>
<p>Specifications for CLIN NO. 0001 AISI-SAE 4340 Steel Bars<br />Introduction:<br />The Materials Reliability Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requires AISI-SAE 4340 steel bars, which NIST will use to produce precisely machined and heat treated Charpy V-notch specimens. These specimens shall be sold by NIST as standard reference materials to certify the performance of Charpy V-notch impact machines. The steel must be of the highest quality possible to ensure uniform impact properties and long term stability (resistance to aging) of the reference material. The American Society for Testing Materials specification E23 describes this test and these specimens.</p>
<p>Compositional and melting requirements:<br />NIST require AISI 4340 steel bars, from a single heat to minimize compositional and micro&not;structural variation. Because steel plants produce steel in different heat sizes (inherent to their facilities), NIST will allow some flexibility by bracketing the quantity of the steel to be purchased and setting a maximum of $100,000.00 for the purchase of CLIN No. 0001.</p>
<p>The steel shall be produced using a double-vacuum-melting procedure (vacuum-induction-melt vacuum-arc-remelt, VIM-VAR). The steel shall meet the compositional requirements of AISI-SAE alloy 4340. The steel must also meet the stricter requirements of AMS 6414, which describes steel production by a vacuum-melting procedure. In addition, we desire the phosphorus, sulfur, vanadium, niobium, titanium, and copper contents of the steel to be low. The maximum concentrations (in mass %) allowed for these elements shall be: (1) P = 0.010, (2) S = 0.010, (3) V = 0.030, (4) Nb = 0.005, (5) Ti = 0.003, and (6) Cu = 0.35. Maximum concentrations for nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen are not specified, however, NIST requires that these elements (and inclusions) are at levels typically found for VIM-VAR 4340 steel.</p>
<p>The composition shall be certified using standard analytical procedures (such as optical emission spectroscopy or x-ray fluorescence), and the equipment is calibrated by standards traceable to NIST. The composition shall be measured at the top and bottom of the remelted ingot. These two measurements shall be included in the documentation with the order, meet our compositional requirements, and meet the limits on residuals given above. Deviations between the two measurements (in mass percent between the top and bottom of VAR ingot) cannot exceed 0.030 for C, Si, and Mo; 0.10 for Mn; 0.030 for Cr; 0.050 for Ni; 0.003 for P; and 0.001 for S.</p>
<p>Product Form:<br />The ingots shall be forged, rolled to billet, conditioned, then hot rolled to bar. The bar shall be finished to 0.50 inch square bar (+0.15 inch, -0.00 inch) and straighten. The corner radius of the finished bars cannot exceed 0.03 inches. The microstructure shall be uniform through the thickness, with a maximum acceptable grain size of ASTM number 7. In other attributes (decarburization, segregation, surface condition, etc.), the steel must be suitable for use as 10 mm square Charpy V-notch specimens.</p>
<p>The 0.50 inch bar shall be fully annealed to a hardness of RB-95 max. The suggested cycle is as follows: (1) heat to 1550 &ordm;F and hold for 6 hours, (2) furnace cool to 1200 &ordm;F and hold 12 hours, and (3) furnace cool to 800 &ordm;F and air cool to room temperature. NIST will accept alternate heat-treating schedules by mutual agreement. The goal is to produce bars with a minimum of large carbides in the structure, the most uniform carbide pre&not;cipitation possible, and a uniform hardness. The bar is required to be machine straightened (for twist and bow), and shipped in lengths of no more than 6 feet.</p>
<p>The bar shall be packaged in bundles identified with reference to the ingot position from which it was processed. This identification is used to limit the material used for a given lot to a single ingot location, which reduces micro-structural inhomogeneities between bars. The bundles must weigh less than 4000 lb, which is the capacity of the NIST fork lift truck.</p>
<p>Specifications for CLIN NO. 0002: NIST 16NiCrMo13 Steel Purchase<br />Introduction:<br />The materials Reliability Division of NIST requires AISI-SAE 4340 steel bars, which we will use to produce precisely machined and heat treated Charpy V-notch specimens. These specimens shall be evaluated by NIST for use as a standard reference material to certify the performance of Charpy V-notch impact machines. The steel must be of the highest quality possible to ensure uniform impact properties and long term stability (resistance to aging) of the reference material The American Society for Testing Materials specification E23 describes this test and these specimens.</p>
<p>Compositional and melting requirements:<br />We require 16NiCrMo13 steel bars, from a single heat to minimize compositional and microstructure variation. Because steel plants produce steel in different heat sizes (inherent to their facilities), we allow some flexibility in our contract by bracketing the quantity of the steel to be purchased.</p>
<p>The steel shall be produced using a vacuum-induction-melt (VIM) to produce a 6 inch diameter electrode, which is then electro slag re-melted (ESR) to an 8 inch diameter ingot. The goal here is to achieve deep desulfurization and refinement of non-metallic inclusions, a homogenous distribution of non-metallic inclusions, a fine-uniform grain structure, and low macrosegregation.</p>
<p>The steel shall meet the compositional requirements of AFNOR NFA35565(94). In addition, we desire the phosphorus, vanadium, titanium, and boron levels to be low. The maximum concentrations (in mass %) allowed for these elements shall be: (1) P =0.02, (2) V = 0.02, (3) Ti = 0.01, and B = 0.005. Maximum concentrations for nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen are not specified, however, we require that these elements (and inclusions) are at low levels typically found for VIM-ESR steel. Reasonable modifications can be requested for the compositional requirements.</p>
<p>SEE ATTACHED TABLE -ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>The composition shall be certified using standard analytical procedures (such as optical emission spectroscopy or x-ray fluorescence), and the equipment is calibrated by standards traceable to NIST. The composition shall be measured at the top and bottom of the re-melted ingot. These two measurements shall be included in the documentation with the order, meet our compositional requirements, and meet the limits on residuals given above. Deviations between the two measurements (in mass percent between the top and bottom of VAR ingot) cannot exceed 0.030 for C, Si, and Mo; 0.10 for Mn; 0.030 for Cr; 0.050 for Ni; 0.003'for P; and 0.001 for S.</p>
<p>Product form:<br />The ingots shall be forged, rolled to billet, conditioned, then hot rolled to bar. The bar shall be finished to 0.50 inch square bar (+0.15 inch, -0.00 inch) and straighten. The corner radius of the finished bars cannot exceed 0.03 inches. The microstructure shall be uniform through the thickness, with a maximum acceptable grain size of ASTM number 7. In other attributes (decarburization, segregation, surface condition, etc.), the steel must be suitable for use as 10 mm square Charpy V-notch specimens.</p>
<p>The 0.50 inch bar shall be fully annealed to achieve a uniform hardness and microstructure. The goal here is to produce bars with a minimum of large precipitates in the structure, the most uniform microstructure possible, and a uniform hardness. The bar is required to be machine straightened (for twist and bow), and shipped in lengths of no more than 6 feet. The bar shall be packaged in bundles identified with reference to the ingot position from which it was processed. This identification is used to limit the material used for a given lot to a single ingot location, which reduces microstructural inhomogeneities between bars. The bundles must weigh less than 4000 lb, which is the capacity of our fork lift truck.</p>
<p>(VII) Required delivery 120 days ARO. Place of delivery is 325 Broadway, Bldg. 22, Boulder, CO 80305-3328. Delivery shall be FOB Destination.</p>

Additionally, the goal of the CFTD is the transfer of training previously conducted in the aircraft to a ground based flight training system in order to relieve the training burden on the CH-53E aircraft thus extending the service life. Recently the MCAS Miramar Weapons Systems Trainer (WST) was modified to increase visual and flight control fidelity establishing this trainer as the government baseline for the CFTD’s.

The CFTD’s will be used to train USMC CH-53E pilots in skills essential for performing various flight tasks including, but not limited to, Assault Support, Combat Operations, and Transport Missions. Specific training tasks will include, but not limited to, Familiarization, Instruments, Navigation, Formation Flying, Confined Area Landings (CAL), External Loads, Terrain Flight (TERF), Defensive Measures, Aerial Refueling (AR) and Core Skill Check.

The CFTD's shall be compatible with existing and future USMC common software baselines to the maximum extent possible. The CFTD’s will be delivered with appropriate Information Assurance (IA) controls, and a certified “Authority to Operate” (ATO) accreditation. Additional requirements will include hardware and software documentation, engineering drawings, initial provisioning of spares to support a 95% readiness rate, initial operation and maintainer instructional training, and integrated logistics support and documentation for eventual independent operation and maintenance.

This award will be made to a contractor in the NAWC-TSD Training Systems Contract (TSC) II Lot I Multiple Award Contract (MAC).  A list of participating prime contractors is attached for subcontracing purposes.

Statement of Work

Safety Impacts of New Traffic Management Techniques

Background

Over the past 15 years, a variety of new traffic management techniques have been introduced, including managed traffic lanes—High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes, High Occupancy Toll (HOT) lanes, Truck-only-Toll (TOT) lanes—congestion pricing, and other demand management and active traffic management strategies.  Although these techniques hold promise for relieving congestion, it is important to understand the safety implications of adopting such strategies.

The extent of experience with some of these procedures is sufficiently limited that analysis of historical data may not produce reliable results.  A recent study (attached) conducted for the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) concluded that traffic simulation models could be used to analyze the likely safety impacts of these new traffic management techniques.  Techniques for simulating traffic conflicts have been developed, including the Federal Highway Administration’s (FHWA) Surrogate Safety Assessment Methodology (SSAM).  Applying simulation methods to new traffic management techniques should be valuable in gaining insight into the effect on safety.

Objective

This objective of this study is to determine the safety impact of deploying advanced traffic management strategies and to recommend approaches that can be taken in designing these strategies that minimize safety risks.  Recent FHWA research on safety impacts using surrogate measures has focused on conflict analysis as the best indicator of safety performance in lieu of crashes.  The conflict analysis seems to be a better analysis for assessing the safety performance of new and innovative traffic management strategies as these strategies have no crash histories to draw from.

Scope and Project Description

Currently, State and local agencies consider only the traffic performance impacts that these strategies have on the roadway system without the consideration of safety.  This study will identify the safety benefits and impacts of the various advanced traffic management strategies that are deployed.  The FHWA SSAM project resulted in a safety analysis software tool that provides frequency of various types of conflicts (i.e., crossing, lane-changing, and rear end) and severity indicators (i.e., time-to-collision, post-encroachment time, speed differential, etc.) by processing vehicle trajectories from micro-simulation models.  
The proposal should convey the proposing team’s current understanding of the various advanced traffic management strategies and the appropriate traffic analysis tools that can be used to evaluate these strategies, both from a traffic performance perspective as well as from a safety perspective.  At a minimum, the team should describe how this understanding will be validated. The proposed validation may consist of an assessment of the analytical tools that exist and how these tools have been used to evaluate the advanced traffic management strategies that are in place.  It may consist of historical data that demonstrate the traffic and safety performance of these strategies and how they affect the highway system.       

The proposal should also identify the primary target audience and describe why the results from this effort will benefit this audience as well as explain how this effort will be distinguished from other available information, guidance and other documents that are available from other sources.  This study would use advanced traffic simulation models, supplemented--where possible--with historical data, to analyze the safety impacts of changes in traffic flow resulting from congestion pricing and changes in weaving movements resulting from dedicated traffic lanes, and reductions in truck-car lane sharing due to truck-only lanes.  The study would include not only the period or location in which the technique is in effect but its safety impact on the highway outside the time period or spatial location of the restriction.

This study will identify the state of the practice and the state of the art in traffic and safety performance measures and will develop guidance in utilizing the range of data available from traffic analysis tools in a manner which the operating agencies, decision maker or seasoned professional would not have otherwise gained through a raw interpretation of individual performance measures.

Supervision

The work will be reviewed and approved by a Government Oversight Panel, that will meet with the contractor at the beginning of the contract, after the approach is finalized and after the draft final report is completed.  Approval by the panel is required at each of these stages.

Technical Approach

Task 1 – Project Management  

The contractor will schedule a kickoff meeting with the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) and the Government Oversight Panel to be held within two weeks of the contract award date.  The Proposed Project Plan (plan submitted in proposal) will be reviewed, and the scope, tasks, and deliverables will be refined during this meeting. The contractor will submit the kickoff meeting minutes along with the contractor’s plan for resolving issues from the meeting  to DOT, which will review it and provide comments to the Contractor, who will incorporate these comments in a revised, Project Plan to be submitted four weeks after contract award.

Task 2 – Review and Summarize Literature  

The Contractor will conduct a literature review to identify the state of the practice and the state of the art in utilizing the range of data available from traffic analysis tools and simulation in a manner which the operating agencies would not have otherwise gained through a raw interpretation of individual performance measures.  This will include the various advanced traffic management strategies and their performance measures from both a traffic performance as well as a safety performance, an assessment of the various analytical tools that have been used and can be used for evaluating these strategies from traffic and safety performance, and available guidance for deploying these strategies both from a traffic performance and safety performance perspective.  

A draft task report will be provided to DOT for review and comments no later than eight weeks after contract award. 

Task 3 – Finalize Project Plan  

Based on the literature review, the Contractor will finalize the approach that the offeror proposes for evaluating the safety impacts of advanced traffic management strategies using analytical methods and simulation tools as well as any historical information for the various traffic management strategies given in the Objective.  

With regard to the traffic management strategies of managed lanes, the contractor is expected to consider the following effects of these lanes on the safety of a highway for:

a.	for demarcated and (b) physically separated lanes, 
b.	within the section of highway containing dedicated lanes and in the area in which traffic merges,
c.	various levels of traffic and various types of vehicles (distinguishing single-unit from combination trucks)
d.	separation of types of vehicles,
e.	weaving of vehicles 
f.	distance between interchanges, and
g.	alteration of routes by travelers.

With regard to the traffic management strategies of congestion pricing, the contractor is expected to consider the effect of these strategies on the safety of a highway:

a. during that time during which peak pricing is in effect, 
b.  prior to and following that period, 
c.  the alteration of temporal patterns of travel, 
d.  lanes that are priced exclusively for trucks and those that allow mixed traffic use, and
e.  diversion of travelers onto non-priced facilities. 


Contractor will submit a finalized project plan no later than three and a half months after contract award. 

Task 4 – Conduct Analysis 

The Contractor will carry out the analysis that will enable a comparison of the safety impacts of the various advanced traffic management strategies, listed under Task 3, and derive conclusions which indicate the safety implications of adopting these strategies  Specifically, the Contractor shall consider currently available simulation models that have the capability to evaluate the advanced traffic management strategies, discussed previously, and can provide the appropriate information that can be used by safety models to come up with safety performance measures.  The simulation models to be considered shall be as a minimum of those commonly used: CORSIM, VISSIM, Paramics, Integration, AIMSUN and TransModeler.  The Safety model SSAM should also be considered as a minimum but other safety models may also be considered.

Task 5 – Develop Guidance and Prepare a Report

Based on Tasks 1 though 4, the Contractor shall develop guidance that can be used to evaluate the safety aspects of various traffic management techniques.  The guidance should provide quantifiable safety benefits and impacts of the various advanced traffic management strategies and an approach or methodology for conducting similar studies.  Consideration and guidance should be given on the development of a method to balance traffic performance and safety performance that agencies can use to deploy these strategies.

Traffic operations and safety analyses can generate a great deal of numerical output.  Any one of the numerical outputs can be important to the analyst depending upon the purpose and scope of the analysis and the alternatives being evaluated.  There is, of course, a significant difference in how different analysis tools compute these outputs.  

The guidance would offer advice on:
•	Selecting traffic and safety performance measures that address benefits and impacts of advanced traffic management strategies
•	Setting up consistent study assumptions and parameters and selecting measures of effectiveness (MOEs) that are as directly comparable as possible.
•	How to prepare each type of analysis in a manner that allows the MOEs of different tools to compliment one another, while avoiding confusing or contradictory results.
•	How to combine traffic analysis tools with safety analysis tools in a manner that allows for safety benefits and impacts
•	How to evaluate and select the most effective and efficient advance management strategy form a traffic performance and a safety performance perspective

The contractor shall prepare a draft final report that shall cover all aspects of the project for submission to DOT.

The Department will make corrections to the report after which the Contractor shall prepare for and deliver to DOT a final report. 


Deliverables

1.	Contractor shall submit reports, at the time expressed as months after contract award, to the Contracting Officer and the COTR as follows:
a.	At the end of Task 1: Refined Project Plan (1 month).
Revised Project Plan (1.5 months)
b.	At the end of Task 2, (2 months)
c.	At the end of Task 3   (3.5 months)
d.	At the end of Task 5, Draft Final Report: (10 months).
e.	After review of the draft final report by the Government, not to exceed 30 days, Final Report, within 12 months after award of contract.


2.	Contractor shall also submit monthly letter progress reports to the Contracting Officer and the COTR describing the activities of the previous month and showing both normatively and graphically the level of funds expended and the planned expenditure of funds over the remaining time of the contract, next steps, problems, and recommended actions.

3.	The final report must meet the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.  The Act requires that all electronic products prepared for the Federal Government be accessible to persons with disabilities, including those with vision, hearing, cognitive, and mobility impairments.

Additional FAR and DFARS clauses required by the regulations will be included.
Local DMC clauses, 52.0100-4028 (Contract Contact Information)(DMC) (JUN 2005) and 52.0100-4094 (Marking Instructions for All Items to Include Drop Ship and Direct Shipment) (JUN 2004), will be included. 


Invoicing Instructions - Mandatory:  

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are to be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Department of Defense, has determined that Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil is the preferred electronic method to be used.  However, if your available computer hardware or computer configuration is incompatible with WAWF, the Web Invoicing System (WinS) at https://ecweb.dfas.mil may be used or any other mutually agreed to electronic method may be used in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause.

Vendors must register in the WAWF system at https://wawf.eb.mil.  If you have questions during the registration process, you can call the WAWF help desk at (866) 618-5988.

The WAWF system provides for submission of invoices in several different forms.  It is recommended that an “Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo)” be used when the contract/order is for supplies and an “Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only)” be used when the contract/order is for services.   Using these types of WAWF documents automatically generates an e-mail notification to the receiver that their acceptance is required for the document to be processed for payment.    

Due to the fact that our office processes contracts/orders for various receivers from other agencies, we cannot at this time guarantee that the Deliver To code in block 15 of the Standard Form 1449 is registered and active in WAWF.  If the code is not active in the WAWF system, you will be unable to use either the “Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo)” or the “Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only)” option in WAWF.  In this case, you will need to enter your invoice using the “Invoice” option.  This will generate a stand-alone invoice not associated with a receiving report.  The receiving office will then be required to separately submit their receiving report to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for processing.

Use of the WAWF electronic invoicing system can decrease the time required to process an invoice.  It also allows for tracking invoices and acceptance on-line without further correspondence.

<DESC>Announcement Details
This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) #DTPH56-09-BAA-000002 seeks proposals on an individual project or a consolidated Research and Development (R&D) program addressing the pipeline safety research described below.

A. Background
As a safety regulator, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) plays a critical role in overseeing the safety of our nation’s pipeline infrastructure.  PHMSA’s approach includes significant coordination and collaboration with a variety of pipeline operators and trade organizations, such as the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America (INGAA) and the American Petroleum Institute (API).  These efforts support effective policies, which maximize public safety along with corporate and national interests.

Understanding the integrity of pipelines relies on a number of factors within a rigorous program for integrity management.  PHMSA has a long history in dealing with anomaly assessments and repair requirements, germane to integrity management, and has co-sponsored much of the research utilized in their development and in their refinement.  

Recent investigations and research are generating questions about anomaly assessments and if criteria are being consistently applied, to provide adequate safety margins.  Tool tolerances, corrosion growth rates, and external stresses are just some of the variables in determining remaining pipeline strength that have opened new dialog between PHMSA and the pipeline industry.  

These concerns drove PHMSA and Pipeline Research Council International (PRCI) to commission a research investigating the performance of methods used to predict the failure pressure of corroded pipes.  Methods investigated were American Association of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) B31G and Modified B31G, RSTRENG, LPC-1, SHELL92, and PCORRC.  Additional information and research findings are available at: Project No. 171, Project No. 172, Project No. 173, Project No. 174, and Project No. 175.

The results of this research were shared with the pipeline industry at an October 22, 2008 public workshop.  PHMSA and INGAA co-sponsored and facilitated the public workshop on Assessment and Repair of Anomalies in Pipelines, at the Gaylord National Hotel in National Harbor (Oxon Hill), Maryland.  Approximately 175 attendees representing Federal and State regulators, industry, researchers, manufacturers, vendors, and the public from both the United States and Canada attended the workshop.  More information, perspectives, and presentations are available at http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/meetings/MtgHome.mtg?mtg=55.

PHMSA and the pipeline industry recognize that there are gaps in the data for some grades of pipe, in particular high strength pipe with deep (>50% through wall) defects, and very long shallow defects.  Further research is necessary to create a more comprehensive understanding of our anomaly assessment methods.  A path forward and strategy were developed to address the remaining gaps identified at the October workshop, and this BAA is a step along this path. PHMSA will formalize an oversight committee which will include, but it is not limited to, members of industry-based natural gas or hazardous liquids pipeline research funding organizations (i.e. PRCI, INGAA, AGA, and API).  PHMSA envisions this oversight committee will monitor this research, and provide comments to PHMSA regarding the work scope and critical tasks awarded to the selected offeror.

B. Objective
To secure a recipient that can safely conduct full scale hydrostatic burst testing on a variety of steel pipeline grades and sizes, and can collect and analyze the necessary test data for comparison with related research findings.  

C. Goals
The main goal of this project is to gather line pipe burst data to evaluate the level of applicability, safety, and reliability of available models for predicting the failure pressure of corroded pipe (i.e. ASME B31G; Modified ASME B31G; R-STRENG; LPC-1; Shell 92; PCORRC).  Project results should be compatible with data compiled in a recently completed, related research project.  The project should fill in gaps in available test data that have been identified for higher strength line pipe (X-65, X-70, and X-80).  Consideration of higher strengths, &#8805;X100, will be held until the work on grades through X80 are completed and the oversight committee reviews all data and results.  Pipe sizes must reflect specifications, quality, and dimensions that are specified in major planned, or recently completed, pipeline construction projects.

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation—Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
Request for Quotations (RFQ) will be evaluated against the requirements listed in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, and the ALC drawings.

Quotes may be submitted on company letterhead stationary and must include the following information: Solicitation Number, Nomenclature, Part Number, Unit Price, Extended Price, Payment Terms and discount offered for prompt payment. 

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government in technical factors, and price considered.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offerors are listed in order of importance.  When combined, non-price factors are more important than price. 

1)	Technical Conformance to Specifications
2)	Past Performance
3)	Price

Technical Conformance 

The technical evaluation will include examination of the product literature and technical features for conformance with the requirements of the drawings. Evaluation of products will be on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer.  The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating obtaining any information not identified in the offer. An offer that does not provide sufficient information which describes their capacity to meet the RFQ’s technical evaluation criteria can result in failure of this evaluation factor. 

Past Performance

Offers shall provide at least two (2) references for recent and relevant contracts for the manufacturing of safety belts.  Reference information must include contract numbers, points of contract names with telephone numbers and other relevant information.  For this factor the Government will evaluate information obtained from past performance information that the Government obtains about the offeror from these contacts or other sources.  Failure to address this requirement can result in failure of this evaluation factor.

Price

Proposals should identify any price reductions offered, or quantity discounts. All responsible sources may submit offers for quantities listed or quantity price breaks which shall be considered by the agency.

Warranties
 
Offerors are required to offer the Government at least the same warranty terms, including offers of extended warranties, offered to the general public in customary commercial practice.

(2) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.   Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies— 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. 
(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<DESC>Vendor's Question

1.What is the closing date of this RFQ?

Closing Date is June 19, 2009 at 5:00pm EST



2.	In the section where it says the Government reserves the right to copy and distribute to anyone transcripts purchased from the Contractor, do you mean anyone within the Government or do you mean that you will provide free copies of our transcripts to opposing counsel?


No, opposing counsel will be required to order and pay at their expense.

3.	In the past, delivery due dates have been calculated in working days, not calendar days.  Are you using those as interchangeable or do you wish to count the weekends?

Working days.

4.	In an effort to keep costs down, sometimes transcripts are needed on a three-day turnaround, which is considerably less than a 24-hour turnaround.  That option is not in the contract.  Would you like us to include rates for that option as well?   

Yes, include three-day turnaround.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer a question posed by a potential offeror.

Question:  "...one question that I do have would be on dust loading or particulate loading in the flue gas.  Would we need to worry about filtration at the duct due to high dust loading?”

Answer:  The generation of particulate matter in natural gas combustion should be minimal.  There is very little dust within the surrounding environment that would be present in the exhaust.

All other terms and conditions of the original solicitation (including closing date and time) are unchanged and remain in full effect.

<DESC><p>This purpose of this amendment is to correct and clarify the following, to attached quotation format and extend the response date as follows:
<p>COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION<br />AISI-SAE 4340 Steel Bars and NIST 16NiCrMo13 Steel</p>
<p>(I) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.5. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>(II) This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). Submit written quotes on RFQ Number RA1341-09-RQ-0435DR.</p>
<p>(III) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32.</p>
<p>(IV) This solicitation is total small business set aside. The associated NAICS code is 331111. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial item(s)/services:</p>
<p>CLIN NO. 0001 - AISI-SAE 4340 Steel Bars, Quantity estimated at 7,000 lbs., in accordance with the following specifications.</p>
<p>CLIN NO. 0002 - 16 Ni CrMo13 Steel Bar - Quantity estimated at 250 to 300 lbs., in accordance with the following specifications.</p>
<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:</p>
<p>Specifications for CLIN NO. 0001 AISI-SAE 4340 Steel Bars<br />Introduction:<br />The Materials Reliability Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requires AISI-SAE 4340 steel bars, which NIST will use to produce precisely machined and heat treated Charpy V-notch specimens. These specimens shall be sold by NIST as standard reference materials to certify the performance of Charpy V-notch impact machines. The steel must be of the highest quality possible to ensure uniform impact properties and long term stability (resistance to aging) of the reference material. The American Society for Testing Materials specification E23 describes this test and these specimens.</p>
<p>Compositional and melting requirements:<br />NIST require AISI 4340 steel bars, from a single heat to minimize compositional and micro&not;structural variation. Because steel plants produce steel in different heat sizes (inherent to their facilities), NIST will allow some flexibility by bracketing the quantity of the steel to be purchased and setting a maximum of $100,000.00 for the purchase of CLIN No. 0001.</p>
<p>The steel shall be produced using a double-vacuum-melting procedure (vacuum-induction-melt vacuum-arc-remelt, VIM-VAR). The steel shall meet the compositional requirements of AISI-SAE alloy 4340. The steel must also meet the stricter requirements of AMS 6414, which describes steel production by a vacuum-melting procedure. In addition, we desire the phosphorus, sulfur, vanadium, niobium, titanium, and copper contents of the steel to be low. The maximum concentrations (in mass %) allowed for these elements shall be: (1) P = 0.010, (2) S = 0.010, (3) V = 0.030, (4) Nb = 0.005, (5) Ti = 0.003, and (6) Cu = 0.35. Maximum concentrations for nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen are not specified, however, NIST requires that these elements (and inclusions) are at levels typically found for VIM-VAR 4340 steel.</p>
<p>The composition shall be certified using standard analytical procedures (such as optical emission spectroscopy or x-ray fluorescence), and the equipment is calibrated by standards traceable to NIST. The composition shall be measured at the top and bottom of the remelted ingot. These two measurements shall be included in the documentation with the order, meet our compositional requirements, and meet the limits on residuals given above. Deviations between the two measurements (in mass percent between the top and bottom of VAR ingot) cannot exceed 0.030 for C, Si, and Mo; 0.10 for Mn; 0.030 for Cr; 0.050 for Ni; 0.003 for P; and 0.001 for S.</p>
<p>Product Form:<br />The ingots shall be forged, rolled to billet, conditioned, then hot rolled to bar. The bar shall be finished to 0.50 inch square bar (+0.15 inch, -0.00 inch) and straighten. The corner radius of the finished bars cannot exceed 0.03 inches. The microstructure shall be uniform through the thickness, with a maximum acceptable grain size of ASTM number 7. In other attributes (decarburization, segregation, surface condition, etc.), the steel must be suitable for use as 10 mm square Charpy V-notch specimens.</p>
<p>The 0.50 inch bar shall be fully annealed to a hardness of RB-95 max. The suggested cycle is as follows: (1) heat to 1550 &ordm;F and hold for 6 hours, (2) furnace cool to 1200 &ordm;F and hold 12 hours, and (3) furnace cool to 800 &ordm;F and air cool to room temperature. NIST will accept alternate heat-treating schedules by mutual agreement. The goal is to produce bars with a minimum of large carbides in the structure, the most uniform carbide pre&not;cipitation possible, and a uniform hardness. The bar is required to be machine straightened (for twist and bow), and shipped in lengths of no more than 6 feet.</p>
<p>The bar shall be packaged in bundles identified with reference to the ingot position from which it was processed. This identification is used to limit the material used for a given lot to a single ingot location, which reduces micro-structural inhomogeneities between bars. The bundles must weigh less than 4000 lb, which is the capacity of the NIST fork lift truck.</p>
<p>Specifications for CLIN NO. 0002: NIST 16NiCrMo13 Steel Purchase<br />Introduction:<br />The materials Reliability Division of NIST requires steel bars, which we will use to produce precisely machined and heat treated Charpy V-notch specimens. These specimens shall be evaluated by NIST for use as a standard reference material to certify the performance of Charpy V-notch impact machines. The steel must be of the highest quality possible to ensure uniform impact properties and long term stability (resistance to aging) of the reference material The American Society for Testing Materials specification E23 describes this test and these specimens.</p>
<p>Compositional and melting requirements:<br />We require 16NiCrMo13 steel bars, from a single heat to minimize compositional and microstructure variation. Because steel plants produce steel in different heat sizes (inherent to their facilities), we allow some flexibility in our contract by bracketing the quantity of the steel to be purchased.</p>
<p>The steel shall be produced using a vacuum-induction-melt (VIM) to produce a 6 inch diameter electrode, which is then electro slag re-melted (ESR) to an 8 inch diameter ingot. The goal here is to achieve deep desulfurization and refinement of non-metallic inclusions, a homogenous distribution of non-metallic inclusions, a fine-uniform grain structure, and low macrosegregation.</p>
<p>The steel shall meet the compositional requirements <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>given in the attached table, which are from the</em></span> of AFNOR NFA35565(94). In addition, we desire the phosphorus, vanadium, titanium, and boron levels to be low. The maximum concentrations (in mass %) allowed for these elements shall be: (1) P =0.02, (2) V = 0.02, (3) Ti = 0.01, and B = 0.005. Maximum concentrations for nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen are not specified, however, we require that these elements (and inclusions) are at low levels typically found for VIM-ESR steel. Reasonable modifications can be requested for the compositional requirements.</p>

<DESC><p><br />Examination Engagement for Review of Medicare Advantage Organizations and Prescription Drug Plans' Financial Information
<p>THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.</p>
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of companies (small, and/or disadvantaged) that are qualified to support CMS in the examination engagements for the review of the Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs) and Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs).</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>From the beginning of the Medicare program in 1965, Medicare has recognized the unique nature of Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) and HMO-like entities and has provided for alternative payment methodologies appropriate for such organizations. The original Medicare amendments to the Social Security Act included the authority for prepaid plans to receive payments for physician services on a basis other than individual charges. Even before the enactment of the federal HMO Act in 1973, the 1972 amendments to the Social Security Act provided authority to contract with HMOs on a risk-sharing basis and on a cost basis.</p>
<p>In 1996, Section 202 of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) added section 1893, to the Social Security Act. Section 1893 established the Medicare Integrity Program (MIP). MIP was established to strengthen CMS's ability to deter waste, fraud and abuse in the Medicare program. It provides for separate and stable long term funding for MIP activities. MIP expands CMS's contracting authority so the agency can more aggressively carry out program safeguard functions.</p>
<p>The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) established the Medicare+Choice (M+C) program, allowing additional types of managed care organizations to secure Medicare contracts. A major intent of the BBA was to replace the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) with new managed care options (i.e. M+C plans, etc.) for beneficiaries. It allowed for new beneficiary options in addition to the well established types of HMO options operating under TEFRA contracts. <br />&emsp;<br />The recently-enacted Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) has expanded the role of private entities in providing benefits to Medicare beneficiaries. First, the law adds a new section to the Social Security Act, 1860D ("Part D") that offers prescription benefits beginning in 2006 through Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs). Secondly, the statute allows for payments to Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs) "local plans" formerly M+C plans, and creates a new type of private plan, "Regional" MA plans or Regional Preferred Provider Organizations (RPPOs).</p>
<p>CMS's Office of Financial Management (OFM) has overall responsibility for the fiscal integrity of all Agency programs which includes the mandated one-third financial audit requirement. OFM will conduct annual audits of the financial records of at least one third of the MAOs and PDPs as required by Sections 1857(d)(1) and 1860D-12 of the Social Security Act.</p>
<p>Description of work:</p>
<p>The main objectives of the examinations are to provide assurance that Medicare Advantage and Prescription Drug payments were proper and organizations' self reported information used to determine payment amounts were valid and correct. The audit contractor shall document the results of the examination, extrapolate the value of appropriate exceptions to the entire population and propose payment adjustments.</p>
<p>The examination engagements shall be made in accordance with the Uniform Examination Program (UEP) for the Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAO) and Prescription Drug Plans (PDP) which, includes:</p>

<p>
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of companies (small, and/or disadvantaged) that are qualified to support CMS in the examination engagements for the review of the Managed Care Organizations (MCOs).</p>

<p>The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) was passed in September 1982 in which Congress mandated the provision of managed care plan options to Medicare beneficiaries. The statute allowed Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in HMOs reimbursed on a cost basis (also known as MCOs) or "risk-contracting" HMOs. HMOs reimbursed on a cost basis are reimbursed for "reasonable cost" incurred for Medicare covered services rendered, related administration on those medical services, plan administration, and a defined special administration. The special administration is reimbursed 100%.</p>
<p>In 1996, Section 202 of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) added section 1893, to the Social Security Act. Section 1893 established the Medicare Integrity Program (MIP). MIP was established to strengthen CMS's ability to deter waste, fraud and abuse in the Medicare program. It provides for separate and stable long term funding for MIP activities. MIP expands CMS's contracting authority so the agency can more aggressively carry out program safeguard functions.</p>

OFM will conduct periodic audits of cost-based managed care organizations in accordance with Section 1876 of the Social Security Act and based on criteria established by CMS.</p>
<p>Description of work:</p>
<p>The objective of the agreed-upon procedure review is to determine whether reimbursable costs claimed by the managed care organization are reasonable, allowable, and allocable in accordance with applicable Medicare laws and regulations.</p>
<p>In addition, the contractor shall evaluate the MCO's Medical Review programs and make recommendations for improvement. The review includes, but is not limited to, the review of the MCO procedures and internal controls over duplicate payments and situations when Medicare is a Secondary Payer (MSP). In addition, the contractor shall evaluate the accuracy and allowability of Medical Coding (CPT codes) and related Relative Value Units (RVUs) (if applicable) to ensure fair apportionment and the accuracy of the claimed medical services costs. <br />&emsp;<br />Requirements for Submitting RFI Responses to CMS:</p>

A critical success factor in creating a sustainable decision framework for IT investment management is having a comprehensive ITG process and Information Technology Governance Repository (ITGR). These provide the strategic view and the informational basis for leadership, governance, and management of the organizational direction to facilitate a robust, repeatable and measurable decision making process for capital investments.

<DESC><p>This is a Sources Sought Notice for the Department of Defense Criminal Investigation Task Force (CITF) to provide investigative case management support. BACKGROUND The Criminal Investigation Task Force (CITF) has sole responsibility for conducting the investigation of alleged or suspected war crimes, acts of terrorism, and other related offenses committed by non-U.S. citizens against the United States or U.S. personnel. A number of these investigations involve individuals who had actively participated in the planning and execution of attacks against our homeland. The CITF is responsible for and is currently involved in providing legal documentation (as the holder of official government record of investigation), as demanded by U.S. court order for habeas and discovery requests to support prosecution of identified terrorists by military tribunal or US federal courts. As with any criminal investigation, as it transitions to trial and prosecution of an offender, the integrity of testimonial, documentary and physical evidence is critical to the judiciary process.</p>

The SIR evaluation process may involve face-to-face negotiations with one or more offerors. All offerors that are eliminated from the competition will be notified in writing.
Written responses to this SIR are due by close of business on June 10, 12:00 p.m. PDT.  The solicitation and any subsequent amendments are available only on-line at http://faaco.faa.gov/

Once technical proposals are received the FAA will evaluate a single tier of technical proposals according to the order of precedence specified below.  At least two qualified offerors in a given tier are required in order to be considered for selection to Phase II Request for Offers (RFO).  If no selection can be made at the first tier, the evaluation will proceed to the next tier.  The tiered order of precedence for considering offers is (from first to last):

The Forest Service intends to issue a solicitation for this project utilizing FAR Part 13 procedures for simplified acquisition.  This acquisition is 100 percent set-aside for HUBZone Small Business concerns.  Offerors will be evaluated on price, experience, and past performance. A single contract will be awarded to the offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, is the best value to the government.  The Government estimate for this project is between $25,000 an d$100,000.

Payment Protection will be required for this project and Davis-Bacon wage rates will apply to any resulting contract.  The proposed contract-type is firm-fixed price.  This solicitation will be available on or about June 12, 2009.

<DESC>**This modifies the previous notice to update the due date to 19 June 2009 @ 2:00 PM (CDT)**This is a Notice of Intent, not a Request for Proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. The Jack C. Montgomery VA Medical Center (JCMVAMC) intends to negotiate and award on a noncompetitive basis to Mobile Medical International Corporation (MMIC) for design of site, site prep, installation, lease of two (2) Mobile Surgical Units (MSU) and prompt de-mobilization with site reparation.  These units will be leased for an estimated period of 12-18 months.  This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy the minimum agency requirements. The NAICS code is 621493.  To date our market research indicates MMIC is the only company we are aware of who has obtained documented certification from the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Service, and earned accreditation from the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC).  MMIC's MSU meets and/or exceeds the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JACHO) requirements for a mobile surgical environment.  However, in the interest of allowing for open competition, if a firm believes it can meet the requirements of this notice, it must furnish the following: (a) company name, DUNS number, Tax ID Number (b) address (c) point of contact (d) phone, fax, and email (e) the respondent must provide a capability statement that addresses the organizations qualifications and ability to meet the requirements stated above (f) demonstrate in writing previous work that has met or exceeded the above said requirements within the last 5 years, provide a brief description of the scope of the project and how it relates to this project.  Supporting evidence and documentation must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements. Information must be sent to the Jack C. Montgomery VA Medical Center, Contracting Officer 90C, 1011 Honor Heights Dr, Muskogee, OK 74401, or via email at Jared.Cariker@va.gov, or via fax at (918) 684-9672. Responses received will be evaluated.  However, a determination by the government not to compete this proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. If no responses are received by 2:00 PM (CDT) June 19, 2009, the JCMVAMC will proceed with the sole source negotiations with MMIC.

<DESC><p>RECOVERY - PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE FOR DESIGN EXCELLENCE FOR DESIGN-BUILD FOR THE RENOVATION OF BYRON G. ROGERS FEDERAL OFFICE BUILDING, DENVER, COLORADO. PROJECT: RECOVERY. GSA Design Excellence Solicitation for Design-Build Modernization of the Byron G. Rogers Federal Office Building, Denver, Colorado. GSA will be using funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 for this project. BUILDING TYPE: Federal Office Building CLIENT AGENCY: General Services Administration - Region 8 Offices SIZE: 494,156 gsf PARKING SPACES: 168 BUDGET: Estimated Construction Cost is between $100,000,000 and $125,000,000 GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Integrated Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. This high performance green building project will continue the legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation through the preservation and modernization of a historic federal building. In accord with this tradition, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program commissions our nation&rsquo;s most talented architects, engineers, landscape architects, and interior designers to prepare our historic federal buildings for the next 50 &ndash; 100 years of service. GSA Design Excellence projects demonstrate the merit of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs, aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give public expression to our democratic values. As required by law, all Federal facilities must meet Federal energy and water conservation goals and security requirements outlined in the Guiding Principles for Sustainable New Construction and Major Renovations of Executive Order 13423; achieve fossil fuel reductions, renewable energy and water conservation goals of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007; conform with the Interagency Security Council (ISC) and GSA design standards for secure facilities; conform to GSA&rsquo;s P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings); and comply with the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). All GSA projects must achieve a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver rating with specific credits required. Projects in or affecting historic properties must comply with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and the Secretary of the Interior&rsquo;s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. This facility must be designed in metric units. This project will be delivered through the Design-Build delivery method. PROJECT DESCRIPTION The project consists of a major modernization upgrade project for the Byron G. Rogers Federal Office Building (FB) and a window replacement project for the adjacent Byron G. Rogers U.S. Courthouse. This work is performed under the direction of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), Rocky Mountain Region, Public Buildings Service (PBS). The FB occupies a prominent position in the Federal District of downtown Denver. It is an existing multi-tenant professional office building with 18 stories and a basement. The FB contains 494,156 gross square feet (GSF), 437,551 rentable square feet (RSF), and 329,433 usable square feet (USF). The current FB tenants will be relocated prior to the start of the modernization project. Agencies to be located in the federal building will be the Commission on Civil Rights, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, Social Security Administration, and the General Services Administration. The courthouse is a multi-tenant office and court building. It is five stories high with a basement and subbasement connected to the FB by a two story section. This section contains building services, a loading dock, and a two lane ramp to the parking garage. The courthouse houses six major tenants including United States District Court, Court Administrative Support Center, Probation and Pre-Trial Services, U.S. 10th Circuit Library, 10th Circuit Mediation and the United States Marshals Service. The building is approximately 248,000 GSF including two levels of underground parking spaces within the basement and sub-basement. A comprehensive modernization project for the courthouse was completed in 2005. The courthouse will remain occupied while the windows are replaced. The federal building and courthouse are located at 1961 Stout Street, Denver, Colorado, 80294. Both buildings are long-term GSA-held assets situated in a prime location near downtown with public transportation within the central business district, in the Federal District of downtown Denver, with a stable tenant base and a high reinvestment need. Project goals and objectives for the federal building are to provide a pleasant, secure, and safe environment for the staff and visitors consistent with guidelines for Federal facilities and specifically the GSA PBS P-100; satisfy current and projected special-use needs, and allow for future expansion of these requirements; design facilities compatible with the tenants&rsquo; existing character and local context, and present a positive image of U.S. Government facilities; use the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System, which is the nationally accepted benchmark for the design, construction, and operation of high-performance green buildings. GSA requires all new construction, renovation, and modernization projects to be certified through the LEED program; owing to the historic significance of the building, all work will follow the Secretary of the Interior&rsquo;s Standards and Illustrated Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings, Revised 1992 (36 CFR 67); upgrade the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems; upgrade the mechanical piping, heating, and hot water systems; upgrade the electrical system and install new telecommunications infrastructure; modernize all elevators; remove all asbestos containing materials (ACMs); implement GSA&rsquo;s workplace procedures and achieve measurable effectiveness results; identify design strategies that work to optimize the project&rsquo;s access to energy from seasonal solar, natural lighting, and wind to reduce undesirable loads and maximize desirable loads to meet desired energy targets for the facility; upgrade by replacing all public and private restrooms, plumbing systems, and fixtures; upgrade building security; replace underground water and waste water service lines. Project goals and objectives for the courthouse are to improve energy efficiency of building by installing high-efficiency windows; upgrade building security and safety by replacing windows. SCOPE OF WORK Design Stage services and Construction Stage work are to be performed by the DB Contractor. Design Stage services include providing Design Concept and Design Development Phase services. Construction Stage work includes preparing construction documents and performing construction in conformance with the project requirements. The scope of services for the Design Stage will require at a minimum: Professional architectural, engineering, interior design, landscape architecture, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, construction documents. The scope of services for the Construction Stage will require at a minimum: preparation of construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), building information and modeling (BIM), CPM scheduling, scope management, value engineering, maintaining construction records, utilizing an electronic project management system in order to manage project documents, monitoring construction costs, commissioning, post-construction contract services (PCCS), abatement, demolition, construction, and other required supplemental services if so requested by the Government. The Design-Build contractor shall have a full understanding of the project, its contract documents, and the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration. Most importantly, the Design-Build contractor shall have complete responsibility for design and construction of the facility, including timely delivery within the project budget. PROCUREMENT STRATEGY The General Services Administration intends to award a firm-fixed price Design-Build Contract based on the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3 and the GSA Design Excellence Program. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) is designed to select a &ldquo;short list&rdquo; of the most highly qualified Offerors who will be requested to submit Phase Two proposals (the short list will NOT be published in FedBizOpps). All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal. The contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. The most highly rated Offerors will be selected to participate in Phase Two (analogous to Request for Proposals (RFP)). In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement. In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include phase-two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304 Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions. The RFQ will be issued electronically after 06/29/2009 on the internet at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. Opportunities for other than Large Businesses: This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12, an Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, must submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable. In this procurement, GSA intends to promote contractors&rsquo; and subcontractors&rsquo; use of registered Apprenticeship Programs.

<SOLNBR>09CR32-NoSolicitation
<RESPDATE>061909
<ARCHDATE>06152010
<CONTACT>LISA D. HAYES PURCHASING AGENT 3032369327     Lisa D Hayes/ORS/USGS/DOI@USGS;

<a href="mailto:EC_helpdesk@NBC.GOV">Point of Contact above, or if none listed, contact the IDEAS EC HELP DESK for assistance</a>
<DESC>The reason for the amendment to this announcement is to correct the response date from:  May 12, 2009 to June 19, 2009.
The US Geological Survey, Rocky Mountain Geographic Science Center (RMGSC) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with NatureServe, 1101 Wilson Blvd., 15th Fl., Arlington, VA  22209-2211 to provide a development of a Terrestrial African Ecosystems Classification with Map-Enabling Attribution as follows:
a) A list and descriptions of vegetation/environment assemblages at the following hierarchical layers: Class, Subclass, Formation, Divisions, and Macrogroup, produced by experts in pre-workshop consultations and a four day ecosystem classification development workshop in Nairobi. 
b) For Macrogroup level ecosystems, a spreadsheet showing most probable attributions of land cover, isobioclimate region, ecological division (Divisions in the hierarchy above),landform class, surficial lithology, and topographic position (lowlands vs. uplands) for each identified macrogroup-Ievel ecosystem. These attributions will subsequently be used as rulesets for aggregating and labeling previously mapped physically distinct areas into ecosystems.
The RMGSC currently supports a USGS effort to map terrestrial ecosystems in Africa as part of a partnership with the US Agency for International Development (US AID) and NASA. The final step in this process requires the classification and labeling of the actual ecosystems, however a continentally comprehensive classification (list and descriptions) of African ecosystems does not yet exist. Therefore in order to complete this effort the need exists to execute and manage a process to develop an ecosystems classification to be used as the framework for completing the African ecosystem map. 
Since the current effort in Africa is only part of a larger global effort taking place under the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) intergovernmental protocol, it is crucial that the classification developed for Africa corresponds with existing classifications. In fact the classification system developed for Africa must employ the same conceptual and organizational logic and hierarchical layers as in NatureServe's classification of ecological system for Latin America and the Caribbbean (Josse et aI., 2003), and NatureServe's ecological classification system for the United States (Comer et aI., 2003). Since these other classifications were developed by NatureServe, development of the African classification by anyone other than NatureServe would involve a significant loss in previously gained experience and effort. 
Firms who feel that they can furnish the required product described above are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Those firms believing they can provide similar products must provide supporting evidence that they can furnish the product identified above in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  The Government will consider all responses received within 5 days of the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by e-mail at ldhayes@usgs.gov.

<DESC><p>GC09-1, NC GENERAL CONSTRUCTION MATOC<br /><br />Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC), for Design/Build or Construction type task orders. Task orders issued under this MATOC are anticipated to require performance of work predominantly in North Carolina. However, this does not preclude issuance of task orders which may require performance of work at other military locations, so long as these sites are located within the South Atlantic Division Area of Operations (North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi). A project requiring use of civil funds or otherwise termed as civil construction is not authorized under this contract.<br /><br />This acquisition is being offered for unrestricted competition. The life of the basic contract is for a base period of three (3) years with two (2) one-year option periods or $499M; whichever occurs first. The pool size (number of contracts that may be awarded) shall not exceed six (6) contractors. The pool of contractors which successfully receive an award will share the total contract capacity of $499M. The Government will use a best value Performance Price Trade-off (PPT) evaluation process in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.101-1. The order limitation of task orders, to include the seed task order that will be used for evaluation purposes and award of the initial contracts, shall range between $5M and $100M. Task orders issued under this MATOC will be firm-fixed price. The initial seed task order may include options. <br /><br />Description of work: Task orders placed under this MATOC may be either of a design-build nature or that of a design-bid-build (construction only) nature. Work may include, but is not limited to, repairs, renovations, alterations, and/or additions to existing buildings such as administrative, recreational, educational, religious, medical, and training type facilities as well as their corresponding support facilities, or infrastructure such as roads, parking, drainage systems, utility systems, and force protection. Work under this MATOC may also include the design and the construction of various types of facilities including but not limited to, administrative, recreational, educational, religious, medical, and training type as well as their corresponding support facilities. Generally, however, task orders anticipated to be issued under this MATOC will be primarily for new, vertical construction and associated site work. <br /><br />The scope of the seed task order, which will be the first task order awarded, involves the construction of a new Intermediate School (IS) to serve 725 students, grades 5 and 6. The school will be reinforced concrete and/or steel framing and will include general-purpose classrooms, art classroom, music classroom, computer labs, gymnasium, multipurpose room with stage and kitchen, specialists rooms, information center, administrative offices, teacher workrooms, and supply/storage rooms. The school will incorporate advanced communication systems to support technology program requirements, as well as general communications. The project scope will also include utilities, parking, bus loading/unloading area, playground, sports facilities, signage, fencing, landscaping, and security lighting. Handicapped access will be provided. Options may also be included in the seed task order. <br /><br />Evaluation Criteria: As this is a solicitation for a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC), a seed task order will be provided for purposes of evaluation and in rendering the best value decision. Only that offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value of those offerors selected to be in the MATOC pool, if any, will also be awarded the seed task order. All other successful offerors, if any, will be awarded a contract with a minimum guarantee of $2,500. The evaluation factors and their relative importance of this solicitation and evaluation process are as follows: <br /><br />Factor 1 CORPORATE RELEVANT SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE, Factor 2 PAST PERFORMANCE, and Factor 3 TECHNICAL APPROACH NARRATIVE. Factor 4 PROPOSED CONTRACT DURATION AND SUMMARY SCHEDULE. <br />Factor 1 is more important than factors 2 and 3 and significantly more important than factor 4. Factor 2 is equal in importance to Factor 3 and more important than Factor 4. Factor 3 is equal in importance to Factor 2 and more important than Factor 4. <br /><br />Price: All non-cost factors, when combined, are significantly more important than Price.<br /><br />Award will be made to those Offerors whose technical submittal and price proposal contain the combination of the criteria requested that offers the best value to the Government. Proposals shall include sufficient detailed information to allow complete evaluation. The Government reserves the right to reject any and all offers. Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of proof of acceptability rests with the Offeror.<br /><br />This solicitation will be issued in electronic format only.

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER DTFH61-02-C-00001.

A modification was issued to contract DTFH61-02-C-00001 for ARRA related information technology support services for the Federal Highway Administration.  A cost reimbursement modification was issued to the contract.  The use of a fixed-price modification is impractical because the nature of the work involves information technology support services which cannot be adequately defined to a level permitting a fixed-price modification.  The requirement was not competed because a contract for general information technology support services for the Federal Highway Administration is already in place.

<DESC>Department of the Treasury, Financial Management Service (FMS) has awarded purchase order TFMS-HQ-09-P-0067, for the delivery of 38 printing plates. The plates will be used on 50 year old F.L. Smith custom check wrapping machines. The printing plates are used to stamp a message on all check envelopes to be delivered for fiscal year 2009 Stimulus Economic Recover payments.  This was a sole source award to ParaGraphics.  The plates had to be in house, and tested promptly to ensure FMS could meet a check disbursement date of 5/13/2009.  Specifications for the plates are exacting, and no other vendor could provide proven, tested printing plates for the wrapper machines within required timeframes.  ParaGraphics plates have been successfully tested previously, and could be produced in the time frame to meet this requirement. Competing this acquisition would have required extensive testing, which could not be accomplished and give the agency adequate time to meet the check disbursement deadline.

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>The modification will require the contractor to:  1)  Upgrade three (3) campgrounds  to 50 amp electrical service and upgrade 11 primitive campsites to utility hookup sites;  2) Increase routine grounds, buildings, and facilities maintenance to include grass mowing, cleaning services, refuse removal, and minor repairs to accommodate the anticipated summer increase in campers;   3)  Perform maintenance on 10 existing toilet buildings; 4)  Prepare site for a  pre-fab toilet building to be located below the dam near a high use fishing area; 5)  Plan, layout and construct in-park water service connections for two (2) parks to adjacent public water sources; 6)  Use existing plans to construct a new gatehouse, park attendant site, and landscape adjacent grounds at the entrance to Amity Campground; 7)  Convert  six (6) existing vault toilets to waterborne facilities; and 8)  Replace shingle roofing with metal roofing on seven (7) picnic shelters.<BR><BR>Additional rationale for issuing modification to existing contract:  1) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared.  The extent of the work and the resources needed can not be fully determined prior to starting the work, because conditions are different at each area.  2)  The contractor is responsible for the complete inspection, maintenance, and repair of all project buildings and structures in 31 recreation areas, three operations areas, and the Project Management Office.  3)  The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during installation.  4)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and during inspections without a detailed scope of work and thus minimizes the time the facilities are closed and the impact on public access to camping and recreation during the busiest season of the year.

<p>1. Purchase Request or Requesition Number and estimated amount<br />F1H2EF 9055 A001 $10,000.00</p>
<p>2. Brief Description of supplies or Services required and the intended use.<br />Telephone technical support for troubleshooting and maintenance from Sierra Nevada Coprporation for the Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) Special Category One (SCAT-1) system supporting Global Hawk operations.</p>
<p>3. Unique Characteristics that limit availability to only one source, with the reason that no other supplies or services can be used.<br />As the Original-Equipment-Manufacturer, Sierra Nevada Corporation has no requirement to provide information or instruction to third-party suppliers.</p>
<p>4. Reason that the suggested source is the only source which can provide the supplies or services.<br />Sierra Nevada Corporation is the sole-source Original-Equipment-Manufacturer of the Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) Special Category One (SCAT-1) system used for Global Hawk operations. Specific survey requirements involve interfacing directly with the Global Hawk DGPS. This includes utilizing the antenna systems already in place. As the manujfacturer of the DGPS, Sierra Nevada Corporation is uniquely qualified to know the specific accureacuy and tolerance requirements for the specified survey as well as how to operate their proprietary software for the Differential Global Positioning System in order to install survey data and to verify proper operation of the equipment after the parameters are loaded into th system. In order for this to become an open acquisition, other participants would need to contract with Sierra Nevada Corporation in order to determine the specific requirements of the survey as they pertrain to the performance of the Global Hawk DGPS. They would also need to be instructed in how to install these survey elements into the DGPS and be able to verify proper system operation. As the manufacturer of this equipment, Sierra Nevada Corporation has no requirement to provide information or instruction to third-party suppliers.</p>
<p>5. Description of market research conducted and the results or a stateemt why market research was not conducted.<br />Market research was not conducted because no other DGPS contractor has access to the corporate proprietary information required to provide these services.</p>
<p>6. Explain why an adequate purchase description or other information suitable to solicit by full and open competition has not been developed or is not available.<br />An adequate purchase description suitable to solicit full and open competition has not been developed because of Corporate Proprietary information.</p>
<p>7. Provide a statement of actions, if any, that the Government may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition.<br />None.</p>
<p>8. Provide a list of any sources that expressed an interest in this requirement.<br />None.</p>
