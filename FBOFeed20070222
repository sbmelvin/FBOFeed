<CONTACT>Paul Griffin Contract Specialist 9077863818     paul_griffin@fws.gov;
<DESC>The US Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 7 Alaska, an agency within the US Department of the Interior intends to negoatiate and award a sole source procurement to the State of Alaska Department of Natural Resources, Office of Natural History and Archaeology, to perform work related to the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 within and on several National Wildlife Refuges throughout Alaska.  This procurement shall include a sole source Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract award and shall include the following: Background: With the passage of the National Historic Preservation Act in 1966 federal agencies became responsible for inventorying, evaluating and managing cultural properties on their lands.  As a result of the Act the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was required to establish a preservation program for administering the Act (NHPA Section 110(a)(2).  The same Act established a nationwide network of State Historic Preservation Offices to assist in historic preservation activities and to advise and assist the federal programs (NHPA Section 101(b)(1)).   Section 101(a)(6)(A) allows the Secretary of the Interior to "enter into direct contracts or cooperative agreements with a State Historic Preservation Officer for any State authorizing such Officer to assist the Secretary in carrying out one or more of the following responsibilities within that State- (i)	Identification and preservation of historic properties (ii)	Determination of the eligibility of properties for listing on the National Register. (iii)	Preparation of nominations for inclusion on the National Register. (iv)	Maintenance of historical and archaeological data bases. (v)	Evaluation of eligibility for Federal preservation incentives. Work Description:  Individual projects will be described in more detail as the need arises but the Fish and Wildlife Service will in general develop small, specific project scopes of work within each delivery order placed against the awarded IDIQ contract to inventory for cultural resources on refuge lands, evaluate identified properties for their eligibility to the National register and prepare nominations for listing sites on the National register.   Specific tasks may include:  a) Identify and preserve historic properties.  For this activity the SHPO Office would conduct pedestrian surveys of the study area, dig shovel or trowel test pits as necessary, prepare site maps of discovered remains and thoroughly document in writing and with photographs and cultural resources found.  The information 	gathered would be of sufficient detail to evaluate the property for National Register eligibility. b) Determine the eligibility of properties for listing on the National Register.  This 	would involve analysis of the physical remains, as well as conducting archival 	and historical research to determine the importance and historic context for each property.  Each property would be evaluated using the eligibility criteria spelled out in 36 CFR 60. c) Prepare nominations for including historic properties on the National Register.  This would involve compiling all historic and cultural records and physical evidence and preparing a formal National Register nomination for selected 	properties.  They would also submit the nominations and shepherd them through the review process.   d) Maintain historical and archaeological data bases.  The State of Alaska maintains a statewide database of known sites.  We could provide support to the office to update database information for National Wildlife Refuges and to facilitate on-line access by this agency. Products: The products developed and delivered will depend on the nature of the task.  Typically they will include the following: a) Identify and preserve historic properties.  The product would include a report of the field investigation, detailing the methodology used in data collection and analysis.  This shall include a discussion of surveying and sampling procedures, the types of data collected, artifact and feature retrieval procedures, recording techniques, classificatory scheme, method of chronological determination, and any special analytical techniques.  Survey area will be described including detailed locational information, acreage of project area, and geographic description.  The results will include a brief evaluation of previous archaeological and historical studies of the region, including dates, extent, and adequacy of past work as it reflects on the interpretation of what might be found in the study area.  All discovered historic properties will be described in detail including nature, physical remains, maps, photographs etc.  An Alaska Heritage Resources Survey form will be submitted to the SHPO and entered on the state database.   b) Determine the eligibility of properties for listing on the National Register.  The product would be a report describing the property and a detailed analysis of the historic context (Eligibility Criteria) and historic integrity of the property (as spelled out in 36 CFR 60).  There would be a definite conclusion as to whether or not the property was eligible for the National Register. c) Prepare nominations for including historic properties on the National Register.  The product here would be the completed National Register documentation and a site being listed on the National Register d) Maintain historical and archaeological data bases.  The product would be updated  and complete listing of known sites on National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and the Government does not intend to evaluate any proposals or offers received.  Award shall be made approximately 45 days following publication of this notice and an announcement shall be posted once any resultant award is made  See Numbered Note 22.

It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed. See Note(s) 22.  KC-135 ATS Synopsis NAICS Code:  336413 Pre-Solicitation Synopsis This notification replaces a Synopsis originally published at the OO-ALC/PK public website 12 Sep 2005, which was issued under the restrictions of the Training Systems Acquisition II (TSA II) ID/IQ Multiple Award Ordering Contract (MAC).  That notice is replaced with the following: The KC-135 Aircrew Training System (ATS) Acquisition Team is planning to solicit a proposal and award, on a sole source basis, a Firm-Fixed Price extension to the existing contract, F33657-91-C-0072, to Flight Safety Services Corporation (FSSC).  This contract is currently scheduled to expire in Sep 2007.  This award means the current incumbent contractor will continue the broadly scoped Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) support encompassed by the existing contract.  The extension will be awarded as soon as is practical and will include one additional base-year with two additional one-year options (total 3 added years). This action effectively postpones re-competition for a follow-on CLS Contract until the FY2010 timeframe.  This proposed action necessitates seeking authority under a Sole Source Justification as per FAR Part 6.302-1. Current CLS activities being performed by FSSC includes daily operation and maintenance of 19 OFTs, 2 Boom Operator Part Task Trainers (BOPTTs) and numerous other trainers required for academic and hands on training required for KC-135 Aircrew Training. CLS also includes daily operation of the Training System Support Center (TSSC) and instruction for KC-135 Aircrews. Global Air Traffic Management (GATM) is being integrated into all OFT's allowing training to be conducted in both Block 30 and Block 40 configurations.  Courseware and software is being upgraded to include new and revised lessons for aircrew students. The KC-135 ATS program faces a confluence of events in the next four years that compel bold proactive management to ensure vital and flexible training continues at peak production levels required by the user without any loss of training or negative impact to the final phase of the GATM modification integration.  USAF KC-135 aircrew training requirements have driven formal training to peak production rates.  Production rates will continue at peak levels through at least the end of FY08 as projected by the lead (AMC) and seven user commands. Under the existing CLS contract, FSSC is responsible for maintaining current student pilot production and GATM hardware and software integration to support the Block 40.  FSSC is responsible for the GATM courseware development and integration into the ATS.   No other company can perform CLS and sustain the current pilot production requirement while performing the transition to Block 40 without some loss in student production.  Currently, with FSSC responsible for both the transition of GATM and performing CLS, they are able to effectively manage both efforts without impacting student production or critical GATM implementation.  If a new contractor is selected to perform CLS during this three year period when GATM courseware is being developed by FSSC it would most likely result in mission failure for the KC-135 ATS. Services under the extension to the contract would encompass the same broadly scoped comprehensive baseline Operations and Maintenance (OM&S) Support engendered in the current contract, as well as, the following potential upgrades/additional requirements:   - Standup and integration of the new Boom Operator Weapons System Trainer (BOWST) into the training system  - Integration of Distributive Mission Operations (DMO) kits and capability for local training into all 19 Operational Flight Trainers (OFTs) - Integration of Visual Threat Recognition and Training (VTRAT) capability into the ATS - De-commissioning of the single E-model WST at Scott AFB, Illinois - Possible relocations of five of the 20 major KC-135 simulators, training assets, and instructor training teams during this timeframe   FSSC is the only source which can continue support under this extension, sustaining vital levels of student production while accomplishing delivery and integration of the final phase of the GATM effort, (development and delivery of GATM courseware into the Altus formal school house).  Delivery and integration of the final phase of the GATM effort will result in a stable ATS baseline with data for interested bidders to review in preparing proposals for re-competition in the FY2010 timeframe.  It is anticipated the data will be available by May 2009, at which time a Request for Proposal (RFP) for re-competition will be released by the government. Under this plan, an atmosphere conducive to expanded competition with manageable risk will be accessible. The Air Force program team seeks comments and information we may be unaware of in regards to this plan.  Responses are required no later than 13 Mar 07. Comments and questions should be directed to the following e-mail address: Lance.hardman@hill.af.mil

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse is soliciting proposals from qualified individuals or organizations having the capability to act as a centralized repository for compounds from domestic and international investigators, commercial sources, and pharmaceutical companies.  The contract shall involve the receipt, purchase, storage and analysis of compounds from various sources, and the shipment of these compounds to domestic and international test sites, as well as maintenance of an extensive inventory and tracking system. The major goal of this project is to provide NIDA with a holding site which has the capability to inventory, analyze and store compounds, prepared under both non-GMP and GMP conditions, in amounts ranging from milligram quantities to several kilograms.  Because some compounds may be scheduled under the Controlled Substances Act, proper DEA registration and adequate security is required. All studies must be carried out under pertinent FDA regulations, such as current Good Clinical Practice (cGCP) and current Good Laboratory Practice (cGLP) regulations. To handle substances under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, DEA Research Registration for Schedules II to V will be required.  NIDA may also require a DEA registration for Schedule I controlled substances. The pertinent FDA's guidelines/guidance shall be followed.  It is estimated that a five year incrementally funded completion type contract with additional option quantities will be awarded. RFP No.  N01DA-7-8873 will be available electronically on or about October 23, 2006.  You can access the RFP through the FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov or through the NIDA website at the following address: http://www.nida.nih.gov/RFP/RFPList.html. The electronic RFP contains all information needed to submit a proposal. No printed version of the solicitation document or source list is available. NIDA will consider proposals submitted by any responsible offeror. Proposals will be due on or about December 7, 2006. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.

<DESC>This is a synopsis under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) for Commercial Items Acquisition in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6 and 13.  Solicitation No. N62473-07-R-1522, REFUSE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL SERVICES AT VARIOUS NAVAL FACILITIES LOCATED IN POINT MUGU, CA TO INCLUDE CAMARILLO HOUSING, LAGUNA PEAK, AND SAN NICHOLAS ISLAND (SNI), is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) and will be a single award Firm-Fixed Price and Indefinite Quantity contract.  The performance period will include a base year and four 12-month option periods.  This solicitation is UNRESTRICTED.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 562111 and the size standard is $11.5 million dollars.  This solicitation incorporates Far 52.212-1, 52.212-2, 52.212-3, 52.212-4 and 52.212-5, which are attached to the solicitation.  The following factors will be used to evaluate offers:  Factor # 1 Key Personnel, Vehicles & Equipment, and Reporting.   Provide a resume of Project Manager and Quality Control Manager to be assigned to the contract.  Key Personnel shall have a minimum five years experience and have a High School Diploma or GED equivalent.  Vehicles & Equipment:  Describe in sufficient detail, vehicles and equipment to meet the work requirements identified in the performance work statement (e.g., leased or owned, how many, age, and status).  Explain how offeror will maintain equipment and containers in a clean, sanitary condition, and minimize odors.  Reporting:  Provide the process the offeror will use to ensure refuse and recyclable materials will be segregated weighed and documented in accordance with the performance work statement.  Factor # 2 Past Performance Provide a list of up to 5 contracts similar in size and complexity to the solicited contract that were completed during the past 3 years and a list of all such similar contracts currently in process.  Provide the information on Exhibit A for each contract.  Evaluation of past performance will often be subjective.  The evaluation of past performance will include the contractor?s history of reasonable and cooperative behavior, commitment to customer satisfaction, record of conforming to applicable law and industry standards (i.e., Service Contract Act Wage Determinations); quality of workmanship, record of recommending and/or implementing innovative approaches and/or technologies; record of controlling costs; safety performance record, and adherence to schedules.  The Government reserves the right to contact any other sources of information that may have knowledge or information on an offeror?s relevant past performance history.  Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any offeror?s proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may not be competitive when compared to proposals of other offerors.  Factor # 3  Price The price proposal for the base and all option periods will be evaluated to determine the reasonableness, realism, and completeness of the offeror's proposal.  One or more of the following techniques will be used to ensure a fair and reasonable price: 1.  Comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation.  2.  Comparison of proposed prices with the independent Government estimate.  3.  Comparison of proposed prices with available historical information.  4.  Comparison of proposed prices with resources proposed.  A price that is found to be either unreasonably high or unrealistically low in relation to the proposed work may be indicative of an inherent lack of understanding of the solicitation requirements and may result in the overall proposal being considered unacceptable.  Relative Importance of the Evaluation Factors: Past Performance is more important than Key Personnel.  Technical factors, when combined, are more important than cost or price.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and represents the best value to the Government, price and non-price factors considered.  THIS RFP WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD FREE OF CHARGE VIA THE INTERNET WORLD WIDE WEB AT http://esol.navfac.navy.mil ON OR AROUND 4 MARCH 2007 AND CAN BE FOUND UNDER SOLICIATION/CONTRACT N62473-07-R-1522.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SSC San Diego), hereby submits Broad Agency Announcement N66001-07-X-2021. Proposals are due no later than 15:00 Pacific Time on 27 March 2008; however, those proposals which are received by  15:00 Pacific Time on 31 March 2007 will have a greatest chance of being funded. Proposals must be submitted electronically to the SPAWAR e-Commerce Central website at https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil. Click on SSC San Diego and then Open BAA. Additional submission instructions are available at the website under Submitting a Proposal? Broad Agency Announcement for Deployable Systems: The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SSC San Diego), in support of the Program Executive Officer for Littoral and Mine Warfare, PMS 420 and PMS 485, is soliciting innovative research and development proposals of multiple mechanical/ocean engineering concepts for automated deployment, recovery and operation of hydrophone and acoustic source arrays deployed from small craft (e.g., 11 m), suspended from buoys, located on the littoral ocean bottom, and deployed from non-dedicated surface ships.  Of additional interest are concepts supporting the networking of such platform systems to provide robust anti-submarine warfare (ASW); command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR); and global domain awareness.  While various military ships can be considered, Surveillance Towed Array (SURTASS) Ships or the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) or small craft launched from LCS are of most interest to the Navy. The areas of interest include: (1) compact, low frequency acoustic source arrays; (2) deployment and retrieval mechanisms; (3) innovative packaging; (4)compact, lightweight power electronics (amplifiers, energy storage); (5) power systems for the lightweight towed arrays; (6) various material storage and handling systems; (7) associated control systems, and software/networking concepts to support distributed C4ISR sensors and global domain awareness; and (8) adaptations of small craft design which may better support such sensor systems. SSC San Diego, in support of the Program Executive Officer for Littoral and Mine Warfare, PMS 420, PMS 485 and the Office of Naval Research, is similarly soliciting innovative research and development proposals to explore use of a small surface craft or buoys to deploy and operate undersea acoustic sensors. The challenges presented by undersea threats provide the impetus for the development of deployable and off-board acoustic surveillance systems which are networked, distributed, and multistatic-capable, such as Advanced Deployable System (ADS), Fixed Distributed System (FDS), and Deployable Autonomous Distributed Systems (DADS).  The very low noise levels associated with modern submarines are a significant challenge for passive systems and a natural augmentation of such systems is the addition of an acoustic source.  In addition to working with the deployed systems, the active signals from such sources could also be received and processed by surface ships with towed arrays.  In this context an active system has the potential for significant improvement in coverage against a quiet target over a purely passive system. An additional benefit for acoustic sources deployed from small craft, unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) or buoys is that this eliminates the vulnerability associated with operating an acoustic source from a large vessel (beaconing). Operations involving a group of  small craft pose several challenges including: (1) dynamics of a small craft from the standpoints of deployment and recovery of a low frequency active array; (2) shock and vibration effects associated with high speed transit of small craft; (3) energy storage and management; (4) high efficiency, high power density amplifiers and transducers; (5) power plant sizing to maximize mission performance; and (6) networking and processing to exploit information provided by distributed sensors and information systems. This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated by FAR 6.102(d)(2) and 35.016. Awards may take the form of procurement contracts, grants, cooperative agreements or other transaction agreements, as appropriate.  Awards will only be made for basic research, applied research, or development that is not related to the development of a specific system. Awards will not be made for commercial or non-developmental items.  Award decisions will be based on a competitive selection of proposals resulting from a peer and/or scientific review.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  The Government may also only select specific tasks within a proposal for award.  No additional request for proposal (RFP), solicitation or other announcement of this opportunity will be made.  It is estimated that three awards may be made as a result of this announcement with approximate ceiling amounts of $1,000,000 each.  Proposals are sought now for award and work efforts in FY07 and FY08. Contractors are invited to submit cost and technical proposals for one or more of the above areas.  Proposals are due no later than 15:00 Pacific Daylight Saving Time on 27 March 2008; however, those proposals which are received by 15:00 Pacific Daylight Saving Time on 31 March 2007 will have the greatest chance of being funded.  Proposals must be submitted electronically to the SPAWAR e-Commerce Central website at https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil. Click on "SSC San Diego" and then "Open BAA."  Additional submission instructions are available at the website under "Submitting a Proposal?" The cost proposal shall be prepared in accordance with the two documents at the website titled "Cost Proposal Instructions" and "Cost Proposal Sample Spreadsheet."  There is no page limitation for the cost proposal The technical proposal shall not exceed twenty (20) pages in length, single- sided on 8 ½ by 11-inch paper.  The technical proposal shall be structured to address the following items, in the stated order: (1) BAA topic area addressed by proposal; (2) summary of key elements within proposal; (3) ability of proposed work to satisfy BAA goals; (4) detailed explanation of proposed work, technical approach, critical issues, etc.; (5) schedule and milestones; (6) explanation of all deliverables, with identification of any data, information or software deliverables that would be provided to the Government with other than unlimited rights; (7) self-evaluation of proposal against the BAA evaluation factors; and (8) explanation of how the proposed effort satisfies the definition (s) of basic research, applied research, or development that is not related to the development of a specific system; the definitions are available at the website.  SSC San Diego will reject proposals that do not conform to instructions. The proposals will be evaluated using the following criteria, which are of equal importance: (1) potential contribution to the mission of the SURTASS and/or LCS programs to increase program responsiveness, efficiency and effectiveness; (2) overall scientific and technical merit, validity of approach, and probability of successfully demonstrating the proposed technology; (3) realism of the proposed cost and availability of funds; (4) potential for economical integration (positive return on investment) into existing and future Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) operations; and (5) interest by NAVSEA components in fielding successful concepts. All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research for exclusive competition among these entities.  SSC San Diego provides no funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs. Information and material submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned.  Questions of a contractual or technical nature should be directed to Ms. Sylvia Evans, SSC San Diego Code 225, via e-mail: sylvia.evans@navy.mil or telephone (619) 553-3292.

<DESC>The National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) to conduct a second phase of repository activity for animal models of Type 1 Diabetes and its complications. 

After consideration of corporate capability statements of firms interested in providing these services it has been determined that to begin anew with a different source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government, as well as unacceptable delays and loss of consistency in data describing disease incidence and severity. 

To the best of our knowledge Jackson Labs is the only responsible source that can satisfy the Agency?s requirement because (1) Jackson Labs houses and maintains the archives of critical previously collected animal strains and data, (2) has extensive experience necessary to conduct activities proposed for the current contract; and (3) no other source can supply the services that will satisfy agency requirements for the follow-on work for this effort. 

Development of the original repository, the Type 1 Diabetes Repository at Jackson Labs (T1DR; http://www.jax.org/t1dr/index.html) was initiated in 2001 and supported by NIDDK through a supplement to an existing NCRR resource, the Induced Mutant Repository (IMR). Strain importation and associated studies and data collection were begun in 2001. To date, the T1DR has imported and archived nearly 150 strains important for diabetes research, and distributed over 500 mice to 100 independent investigators.  In addition, disease incidence studies have been performed on nearly 20 of the imported recombinant strains within the context of Jackson Labs vivarium conditions. This ability to measure the impact of genetic changes on Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) within the context of the common and consistent environment provided within the Jackson Labs vivarium was a necessary and critical component of T1DR research activity in the prior project phase that must be maintained to provide consistency of results in Phase II. Finally, the ability of Jackson Laboratories to distribute T1DR-archived strains to investigators in most cases without the need for additional quarantine procedures beyond what is required for receipt of commercially available JAX strains is necessary to expedite and maximize the efficiency of research.   

For cost and efficiency purposes, NIDDK plans to continue the second phase of the T1DR using a single contractor (Jackson Laboratories). The contractor will continue activities to help identify mouse strains of unique value to T1D research, will import and archive these strains, will verify disease incidence and severity in a subset of the imported strains under controlled housing conditions, and will facilitate limited distribution of mice to the scientific community. In addition, the contractor will provide strain development support services for the NIDDK-funded Animal Models of Diabetic Complications Consortium. This activity will require production, housing, phenotyping, archiving, and distribution of mouse strains important for advancing research in diabetic complications. 

Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.302-1, The Jackson Laboratories is the only source capable of performing this requirement due to their unique vivarium conditions and distribution capabilities, and prerequisite knowledge, experience and existing data generated through work performed under the prior supplement provided by NIDDK to the NCRR Induced Mutant Resource grant.

Although it is our intentions to make award to Jackson Laboratories, all interested parties may submit a response to the Request for Proposal (RFP) which shall be released on or about October 10, 2006. Responses will be due no later than November 9, 2006.

<DESC>The goal of this research opportunity is to develop and transition affordable, high performance, solid state Radio Frequency (RF) electronics for future Naval Radar and Electronic Warfare systems that will provide a decisive edge to the warfighter.  The program encompasses RF research, design, modeling, fabrication, and testing of devices, integrated circuits, and multi-chip assemblies that span digital, analog and microwave technologies.  Toward that end, ONR invests in electronics science and technology initiatives which will provide the present Navy and Next Generation Navy with electronics technology to meet these needs.  Such future generation systems include a range of Radar and Electronic Warfare / Electronic Attack functions and require active electronically scanned arrays (AESA?s) operating at microwave frequencies. The emphasis of this topic is affordability with an objective of 40% reduction of the life cycle cost of current and next generation radars and electronic warfare systems.

<DESC>The goal of electronic warfare is to control the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum by exploiting, disrupting, or denying enemy use of the spectrum while ensuring its use by friendly forces. To that end, ONR's Electronic Warfare Discovery and Invention (D&I) program invests in science and technology (S&T) initiatives that will provide naval forces (including Navy and Marine Corps) with improved threat warning systems, electronic support measures (ESM), decoys, and electronic attack (EA) countermeasures as well as communication and navigation countermeasures. 

ONR 312 Electronic Warfare (EW) seeks white papers for efforts that shall develop and demonstrate technologies for the next generation components and systems in Electronic Warfare. White papers should address technology developments in one or more of the following areas.

a.	Electro-Optical/Infrared Sensor Electronic Field of Regard, Field-of-View (FOV) and Magnification

The Office of Naval Research (ONR-312) seeks innovative technology development proposals for small, light-weight electro-optic and infrared sensors and/or technology for dynamically allocatable field of view (FOV)/magnification.  The thrust is to develop sensor technology enabling low cost persistent surveillance and targeting.  It should be suitable ultimately for small payload, 5 pounds typically, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). The sensor technology should not be mechanical gimbals or mechanical pan-tilt-zoom. The sensors should be optronically/electronically pointable (ie. optically agile beam steering).  The technology should ultimately be capable of up to +/- 90 degrees pointing/steering and electronic magnification (3X to 12X) capable. Electronically addressed active optics should enable optical sensors that can steer quickly between lines of sight and change to multiple fields of view for reconnaissance applications. This includes wide FOV for surveillance, high resolution narrow FOV for target identification and tracking, and fast electronically addressable pointing for tracking of multiple targets. Attention/consideration should be given to knowing where the sensor FOV is directed so image registration and target geolocation can be determined. Passive visible and infrared imaging sensors/technology are of particular interest. 

b.	EO-IR Scene Simulation for Persistent Surveillance Development 

The objective is to develop a scene simulation capability, in the electro-optical and infrared spectral bands, to use for developing and evaluating automated scene/image understanding and autonomous sensor management algorithms.  The effort should be phased and incremental to develop initial capabilities in as timely a manner as possible.  Maximum possible use of DoD lab existing simulations/scene generators is encouraged.  For example, the NRL TEW 	Division IR signature and background generation software (IRcruise) and the NVESD Paint the Night software should be considered.  The aspect angles from overhead (UAV-based sensors) has not previously been a focus area.  The scenario/scene generation should ultimately be capable of generating maritime, littoral, urban and rural scenes.  Please see the full announcement for more information.

<SUBJECT>A -- DEVELOPMENT OF A THIRD GENERATION ANTHRAX VACCINE
<SOLNBR>RFP-NIH-NIAID-DMID-07-05

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious diseases.  The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), supports a comprehensive extramural research program focused on the prevention and control of diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents (with the exception of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus).  This includes basic research, such as studies of microbial biology and physiology; applied research, including the development of vaccines, therapeutics and medical diagnostics; as well as clinical studies to evaluate experimental drugs and vaccines.

Recent threats of the use of infectious agents as biological weapons have generated increased concern for the safety of the general American populace.  Bacillus anthracis (B. anthracis) is the etiologic agent of anthrax.  The ability to generate high titer anthrax spores using basic microbiological techniques combined with the ability of these agents to be disseminated by aerosolization, has made anthrax a primary bioterrorist and military threat.  With the deliberate exposure of citizens of the United States to B. anthracis spores in 2001, there is an urgent need to stockpile appropriate and effective medical countermeasures to protect all U.S. citizens from the morbidity and mortality associated with infection from these instruments of terror.  

The NIAID has a requirement for the advanced development and testing of anthrax vaccine candidates which build upon the second generation vaccine, resulting in properties desirable for a biodefense vaccine to be stored in the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS).  These properties include long-term stability (i.e., three years or longer) at room temperature, the ability to generate a protective immune response in one or two doses, and the ability to safely self-administer and/or rapidly inoculate into large numbers of people.  Anthrax vaccine candidates eligible for support under this solicitation shall possess any one or all of the characteristics listed above while maintaining a superior safety profile to the currently U.S. licensed anthrax vaccine.  Novel formulations/final vaccine presentation, new delivery platforms, adjuvants other than aluminum, and inclusion of antigens in addition to protective antigen (PA) may be components of candidate vaccines.

 
The project involves:  (1) manufacture and testing of anthrax vaccine candidates possessing any one or all of the characteristics listed above; (2) production of vaccine components and final product at pilot-lot scale; (3) characterization and testing including a stability program; (4) one or more pre-clinical safety studies required for the filing of an Investigational New Drug application (IND); and (5) non-clinical aerosol spore challenge studies using rabbit and non-human primate models. 

The Request for Proposal will include Mandatory Qualification Criteria that must be met at the time of receipt of the original proposal submission and they are as follows: Documentation must be provided to verify that the proposed anthrax vaccine candidate meets the following minimum development status criteria:  a) As purified Protective antigen, (PA) has been shown to be efficacious against B. anthracis spore challenge in animal models, the proposed vaccine must contain a PA component; b) The PA component may be proteinaceous or nucleotide-encoded; c) Should the final vaccine presentation/inoculation strategy include a novel device, a Premarket Approval Application (PMA) or a Premarket Notification Form 510K must be currently filed with the FDA, and documentation provided in the Technical Proposal; and d) Data and results from a proof-of-concept study of the vaccine candidate in an anthrax spore challenge animal model which has demonstrated vaccine efficacy must be provided in the Technical Proposal.  This may be in the form of a final study report or a peer-reviewed publication.

If a novel device for vaccine delivery is proposed, contract funds may be utilized to suitably formulate the candidate vaccine for the device; however, funds may not be used for developing a device.  This RFP will require that a Pre-market Approval Application (PMA) or a Premarket Notification Form 510K must be currently filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for such devices and documentation provided in the Technical Proposal. 

Potential offerors must also demonstrate and document the following in their technical proposal:  (1) the vaccine candidate development status relating to established Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) pilot-scale production of clinical grade material suitable for use in Phase 1/2 clinical trials; (2) justification that further development of the proposed candidate vaccine as it relates to the objectives of this RFP (improved safety profile, rapid and robust titers in no more than two doses, elimination of cold chain/long-term stability, and ease of delivery for use in an emergency event) is warranted, while maintaining an improved safety/reactogenicity profile over the current licensed vaccine and at least equivalent efficacy; (3) documentation that the candidate contains, in part, a PA component; (4) demonstration of the availability and adequacy of facilities for cGMP drug substance (DS) and cGMP final drug product (FDP) manufacturing at pilot-lot manufacturing scale. For this RFP, pilot-scale DS fermentation is defined as a minimum of 30 liter working volume and/or sufficient DS to fill 2,000 doses of FDP. FDP is defined as a minimum of 2,000 final doses per single lot run. Potential sources proposing methodology for DS production other than fermentation must provide documentation to indicate that current yield is of equivalent quantity as above requirements.  Pilot-lot scale processes must be readily transferable to large scale manufacture; (5) previous experience in developing and conducting non-clinical development plans to evaluate safety and efficacy of vaccine candidates that includes the conduct of all FDA required Investigational New Drug application (IND) enabling studies; and (6) previous experience in developing and executing clinical development plans to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of vaccine candidates.

It is anticipated that one or more cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a three-year period of performance beginning on or about June 08, 2007, In addition, the contract will contain two Options.  If executed, and will require the contractor to design and conduct a Phase 1 dose escalating clinical trial in healthy subjects ages 18 to 40 and up to two Phase 2 clinical trials in healthy subjects ages 18 to 55.  It is estimated that the provision of FTEs will be approximately as follows:  13 FTE for Base Year 1 & 2; Reduced to 7.55 FTEs for Base Year 3; 2.1 FTEs for Year 3--Option 1; 2.1 FTEs per year in Option 2 (Years 4-7).  The Option periods could increase the contract value and extend the contract by up to four years.   

Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government.   This RFP will be available electronically on/about June 19, 2006, and may be accessed through the NIAID Office of Acquisitions (OA) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract and on FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>THIS PROJECT IS ADVERTISED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS PURSUANT TO THE SMALL BUSINESS COMPETITIVE DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; THE NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE FOR THIS PROJECT IS 238220.  The Department of Veteran's Affairs (DVA) is contemplating the award of up to six  Multiple Award Contract (MAC) to Mechanical/Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Contractors having experience with design/build and performance-based contracts, and with past experience with Department of Defense (DoD) or other Government healthcare facilities, to perform as prime contractors on various mechanical and/or HVAC Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization (SRM) projects within the Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) locations.  Approximately 10 to 15% of projects may require performance in non-hostile OCONUS and/or foreign locations.  These projects are being procured by the DVA for the Air Force, or other potential DoD agencies, under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 8111.  In general, the MAC contracted efforts will consist of furnishing all labor, supervision, tools, materials, and equipment necessary to perform SRM services for DoD Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF) nationwide, possibly including Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico, and other US territories, as well as OCONUS foreign locations such as Japan, South Korea, Italy, and Great Britain.&#160;&#160;&#160;Anticipated requirements include one-time repair, renovation, and maintenance of mechanical and HVAC equipment within medical facilities to include preventive, predictive, demand, and emergency maintenance.&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition, task orders may include efforts classified as construction requirements incidental to SRM needs (such as installation/extension of utilities, minor reconfiguration of treatment areas to support new medical equipment, etc).&#160;&#160;&#160;Medical facilities may be of any configuration or state of repair depending on age and location.  Example systems and equipment include but are not limited to plumbing systems; HVAC heating boilers; HVAC water chillers; HVAC cooling towers; HVAC pumps; variable frequency&#160;motor controllers; HVAC air handling units; and digital HVAC controls.&#160;&#160;&#160; Contractors must be aware of the health and life safety issues that must be considered while performing these demanding tasks in an occupied hospitals and clinics with active inpatient, outpatient, and staff populations.&#160;&#160;&#160;Specific requirements, such as the stringent infection control measures in place at all medical treatment facilities, will be identified in the individual task orders, but potential offerors are advised that special requirements (to include requirements ranging from security to immunization requirements for individual workers) are typically required because the work will be performed in occupied medical treatment and/or medical research facilities.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Government contemplates awards of at least three Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts resulting from this solicitation which will include a base year and four one-year options.&#160;&#160;&#160;The total maximum value to be shared amongst all contracts awarded under&#160;this solicitation is estimated at $250,000,000.00 over five years. There is no guarantee that this maximum value will be distributed equally.  Awardees will share this total value through a competitive task order award process.  SPECIAL NOTE:  One MAC contractor will be issued an initial task order based on competitively evaluated award of a seed project included in the MAC solicitation.  This seed project within this MAC solicitation is a modernization effort at the 51st Medical Group Hospital located at Osan Air Base, South Korea.   This 101,215 Sq Ft facility was constructed in 1988.  This effort will entail the following tasks:  1 - Replacement of the existing legacy hybrid Electronic-Over-Pneumatic Building Automation Control with a New BACNet DDC Control System; 2 - Upgrade the CBR filtration system dampers and connect them to the new DDC BAS; 3 - Conversion of the fire dampers from Pneumatic to Electronic; 4 - Conversion of the Steam Boiler to Hot Water Production to a Direct Hot Water Boiler System; and 5 - Performance optimization of the HVAC System.  The estimated value of this seed project effort is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.  Project will require completion within 180 days after issuance of the notice to proceed.  Performance and payment bonds will be required on this task order in an undetermined percentage, and also in a majority of other task orders issued under this MAC award.  Offerors must possess the bonding capabilities and sufficient resources required by the scope of this contract in order to be favorably considered.  This requirement is being procured through the Denver Acquisition and Logistics Center, Lakewood, CO.  Solicitation documents should be available for download on or around 15 March 2007.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Contracting Officer for this anticipated contract is Ray Blomquist.&#160;&#160;&#160;Questions specific to this solicitation may be answered by sending an email request to ray.blomquist@va.gov.&#160; Alternate points of contact:  Marc Cypert (marc.cypert@va.gov) and Jay Hawkins (Jay.Hawkins@brooks.af.mil).  There is no cost for this solicitation.&#160;&#160;All responsible sources may submit an offer.&#160;&#160;Telephone and fax requests are discouraged.  The Government will try to respond to all questions, however, response may not be furnished to questions received late in the solicitation period (less than 10 days prior to the proposal due date).&#160;&#160;A pre-proposal conference is tentatively set to be held at Brooks City Base, San Antonio, Texas on March 22, 2007.   Exact time and location is pending and will be included in the solicitation and posted on this web site.  The purpose of the conference is to familiarize the Offerors with the scope of work, address questions concerning the basic contract awards and initial seed project, and familiarize offerors with the MAC and seed project Statement of Work and the Best Value evaluation and award process.  Attendance at the conference is strongly encouraged.  Notes from the pre-proposal conference will be prepared by the Government and placed on this website as an amendment or additional notice.  The VA cannot assume responsibility for any verbal or written assurances or representations concerning conditions made by any of its officers or agents prior to the execution of the contract, unless included by the Contracting Officer in the Request for Proposals, the specifications, or related documents.&#160;&#160;&#160;All potential offerors must be registered on Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to award.  This office is not responsible for providing you with notifications of any changes to this solicitation. The solicitation will be available only as a direct download and not be issued on CD-ROM.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The White Sands Missile Range Contracting Office plans to procure on a sole source basis Maintenance Service for Swiftlink Satellite Systems from Telecommunication Systems, Inc. (TCS) currently in use by the Rapid Equipping Force.  Because TCS has pr oprietary rights to the Swiftlink and because of the number of systems and additional components integrated into those systems by TCS, they are understandably familiar with the system.  In addition, because of the experience of this firm with their continu ed support to the systems, they can help mitigate the risk associated with procuring maintenance service from a supplier that may not fully understand the system.  This is not a request for proposals and no solicitation will be forthcoming.  Point of Conta ct is Amenda (Mindy) Franklin, mindy.franklin@us.army.mil or 301-833-5495.  Any interested parties must contact Amenda Franklin NLT 1400 EST  01 March 2007.

This infrastructure will provide the proper redundancy and end user support in the event of an emergency if needed.  The additional procurement of these servers will allow for the expansion and future growth of the ONE system at the Department of State.  This will give the Department the opportunity to continue the growing support of the ONE program. Nature and/or description of the action being approved. The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Information Resource Management, E-Mail Division (IRM/OPS/MSO/EML).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of HP Compaq Servers and associated Equipment.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency’s needs. IRM/OPS/MSO/EML has identified the HP Compaq Products as a key component of the Department’s OpenNet Everywhere (ONE) and a Blackberry Enterprise Server (BES) systems.  The equipment listed above is required to support the system expansion and future growth of the ONE and Blackberry programs.  The Mobile Computing infrastructure is a Compaq/Cisco environment. An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. The 41USC 253©(1), and FAR 6.302-1 area cited as the statutory authority. A demonstration that the proposed contractor’s unique qualification or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s ONE and Blackberry networking infrastructure.<BR><BR>CORRECTED PART # FOR LINE ITEM 003.<BR><BR>

D) Full Dell warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Consular Affairs Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST has identified the Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation as a key component for overseas Consular windows, interviewing booths and staff offices.  The Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation was selected for this purpose because of the results obtained by Creative Information Technology, Inc. to replace a like number of older PCs used overseas in Consular interviewing booths and staff offices. The Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation is only small form factor workstation that fully meets Consular needs, and was selected for the following reasons: 1) It is a specific all-in-one configuration that includes three separate components: the Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation, a 19-inch Dell flat panel monitor, and a stand.  It occupies less than 1/3 of the space used by conventional mini-tower PCs deployed by the Bureau of Consular Affairs and eliminates overcrowding common to interviewing booths and visa issuance desks.  Moreover, the Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation provides additional space with an opening underneath the monitor that can be used for keyboard storage or to corral small office supplies. This space can be significantly useful to users with limited workspace.   2) It is the only small form factor PC manufactured that combines the screen display, processor, and all other components in one compact unit, while still allowing the components to separate from each other.  This feature is useful when one piece of the all-in-one configuration is malfunctioning and must be replaced.      3) The Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation complies with CA’s baseline standard for desktop PCs and is fully compatible with the Consular HW and SW environments. The following Consular Affairs overseas applications were tested for functionality: ACRS, ACS, ACS+, ST, CST_PWD, INK, IVO, and NIV. 4) The Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation has BTX (balance technology extended) chassis, power supply, and motherboard that are designed for thermal efficiency providing improved reliability and quieter operation. Dell’s HyperCool thermal management technology uses variable speed fans that provide optimal cooling with less power and enables quieter operation. 5) The workstation is a modular unit and uses industry standard components, which will decrease the amount of time needed service this workstation. The Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation offers a 2.8 GHz Pentium 4 processor, with an Intel 945G Express chipset. The Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation comes equipped with an 80 gigabyte SATA drive, and 512 MB of RAM<BR><BR>The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation has undergone test and assessment, evaluation for overseas deployments and received final approval from the Department of State Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board.<BR><BR>AMENDED TO CHANGE THE RESPONSE DATE TO 02/26/07<BR><BR>

<DESC>CORRECTION:  This action was originally published in the FBO Presolicitation Notice dated 13 February 2007.  The following information is added:  In accordance with AFFARS 5301.91, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. Before consulting with an Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Bonnie Goetz, (315) 330-2008, bonnie.goetz@rl.af.mil, for resolution. AFFARS Clause 5352.201-9101 Ombudsman (AUG 2005) will be incorporated into the resultant contract. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the Ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official.  Further, the Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The Ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. Consulting an Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).   If resolution cannot be made by the Contracting Officer, concerned parties may contact the following AFRL Ombudsman:  Amy Smith, AFRL/PK, Building 15, Room 225, 1864 Fourth Street, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7132, (937) 255-3079.  Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the AFRL level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force Ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.  The Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.   Do not contact the Ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements.  Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.  All other information publicized in the original synopsis is correct.

<DESC>The Office of the Federal Detention Trustee (OFDT) has a requirement for a secured bed detention facility to house 1,000 detainees (male only) in the custody of the U.S Department of Justice, United States Marshals Services (USMS) and the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The successful offeror will provide a Contractor-owned and operated facility capable of housing up to 900 USMS detainees charged with federal offenses, detained while awaiting trial or sentencing, and 100 ICE detainees awaiting a hearing on their immigration status or deportation. The facility shall be located within 75 miles of the Lloyd D. George - U.S. Federal Courthouse, 333 Las Vegas Boulevard South, Suite 2058, Las Vegas, NV 89101.  The successful offeror will be required to provide all personnel, services, equipment, material, supplies (to include full medical services and all transportation services within 250 miles of the facility) required for management and operation of a secure detention facility. 

Offeror will be required to provide information to the Government to ensure compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4321, et seq., and the implementing regulations at 40 C.F.R. Part 1500. To qualify for participation in this procurement, all potential offerors shall submit the following information for each site for which the offeror plans to provide a proposal. Not later than April 30, 2007, the offeror shall submit a Phase I Survey conducted in accordance with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), E-1527-05, "Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessment: Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Process." The Phase I Survey shall include, as a "Non-Scope Consideration" under Chapter 12 of the Standard Practice, a delineation or identification of on-site wetlands, and an analysis of potential impacts to threaten or endangered species or species of special status. The identification of on-site wetlands should include and on-site reconnaissance level survey/report by a qualified wetlands specialist, the National Wetlands Inventory map for the project area, and an identification of hydric soils on the proposed property. The analysis of potential impacts to threatened and endangered species of special status should include a site reconnaissance report identifying potential habitat or presence of protected species (plant and animal) lists. Failure to submit the Phase I Survey by April 30, 2007 shall preclude that site from being considered for this procurement. The Government will only accept offers for which a Phase I Survey has been timely submitted. All other offers will be rejected.  All information submitted as a part of the Phase I Survey shall be considered non-proprietary and, at the discretion of the Government, be made public during the Scoping process under NEPA or at any other appropriate time. 

To be considered, the offeror submitting the proposal must clearly demonstrate at the time of proposal submission it has corporate experience operating secure detention facilities over a continuous three-year period as of the date the RFP was issued. Note, point ventures will be considered as long as one partner meets the corporate experience requirement. Multiple proposals from one offeror will not be accepted.  OFDT intends to award a firm-fixed price contract for an estimated term of 20 years (base period of five years and three (3) five year option years). The Government reserves its right to negotiate the terms of the contract. Interested parties are advised that Past Performance and Experience will be significant factors in the evaluation of offers and award selection shall be made on a Best Value basis.   Consideration will be given for new construction, expansion, renovation or use of an existing facility.

OFDT estimates issuing the solicitation on or about May 1, 2007.  All interested parties requiring further information should send an email to Lori.Ray@usdoj.gov.  Telephone calls will not be accepted.

You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled ?Register with FedTeDS? and then choosing the ?Vendor Registration Form? hyperlink.  At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information: Your Company's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from your Company's , CCR Point of Contact) Your Company's DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number),Your Telephone Number, Your E-Mail Address.

ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations.  With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  Potential offerors should refer to the solicitation package regarding instructions involving the use of ORCA.


Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and monitoring the Federal Business Opportunities website for amendment(s), if any, to the solicitation.

<DESC>This announcement is for the procurement of part-numbered items for which Hydraulic International (CAGE 56529) is, or has been, an approved source and/or has supplied the item in the past either directly or through dealers whether or not the NSNs are ultimately provided by Hydraulic International.

<DESC>This synopsis replaces the synopsis posted on October 15, 2004 due to a change in Contract Specialists/Contracting Officers. This solicitation modifies the list of potential tasks and the selection criteria and requires interested firms to submit their qualifications using only the SF 330. This applies to firms that have previously responded with their SF 254s and SF 255s as well as those that have not yet responded. Firms that previously responded with their SF 330s do not re-submit. The response date is open and will remain open indefinitely. Note: You will not be notified unless your firm has been selected to perform a task (see below).

In this synopsis, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AO) requests submission of SF 330s (only) by Architectural/Engineering firms desiring to be considered for government contracts not to exceed $100,000. The SF 330 information will be compiled and managed in a database by a permanent AO Architect/Engineer Selection Board. Please do not submit any information other than the SF 330 as it will be discarded. Only the SF 330 will be filed and stored, and only information in the SF 330 will be entered in the database and considered for potential tasks. No actual contract documentation or construction administration (or new building designs) will result as part of these broad-based Architectural/Engineering services tasks. Tasks will consist of providing limited assistance to the judiciary and the AO on individual projects, primarily as conducted for the judiciary by the General Services Administration (GSA). Tasks may include, but are not limited to, project-related program and design analysis and evaluation; small scale schematic design; furniture and interiors services; technical document reviews; value engineering services; architectural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and structural analysis and evaluation; historical preservation studies; courtroom technologies consultation; blast-resistant and security design criteria development; environmental (sick building) testing and analysis; and preparation of other studies and reports to support the judiciary. Potential tasks will be geographically located only throughout the 50 United States and the U.S. Territories. Travel may be, but is not always, required. In no prioritized order of importance, individual tasks will be awarded to firms based on a combination of the following criteria: (1) Past performance on contracts with the judiciary, other government entities, and private industry, in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with the U.S. Courts Design Guide and performance schedules; (2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required; (3) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services; (4) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time; and (5) Staffed location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality. In making the award determination for each task the AO Architect/Engineer Selection Board will rank the firms most qualified to perform the work and provide its list to the Contracting Officer (CO) who will review it, make the final selection list, attempt to negotiate a fair and reasonable price with the firm ranked first and, if successful, award to that firm. If unsuccessful, the CO will attempt to negotiate with the next firm on the list and so forth, until award is made or it is necessary to request an additional listing from the selection board. This process will continue until award is accomplished.

<SOLNBR>W81XWH-07-T-0048
<RESPDATE>030207
<ARCHDATE>05012007
<CONTACT>bmiller, 301-619-1078
<DESC>Solicitation # W81XWH-07-T-0048 Protective Patient Wrap Question / Answers A)	Is there any technical data that the government is particularly interested in receiving? Yes, any available material property characterization measurements (AATCC, ASTM&etc) such as burst strength, tear resistance, cut resistance, puncture resistance, etc. that would help define our performance expectations for the products. Also, a listing of  any current chemical protective use applications for the subject materials with all performance measures referenced to the standards they were tested with such as NFPA 1994, AVLAG TOP 8-2-501&etc. Also we would need the methods used to test the CO/O2 exchange and all data associated with this.  B)	How much assistance will the Army provide to the vendor of choice during development of a new Protective Patient Wrap (PPW)? This is not a currently funded development effort.  This RFI is to determine if there is any new fabric material that satisfies the requirements and that can be applied to our current design or if there is any COTS (commercial of the shelf) item out there that fits our need or may require just a minor modification to fit our need. C)  How can the vendor of choice state for certain that their materials and finished product will meet or exceed the stated Key Product Parameters (KPP) and desired Additional Attributes (ATT)? The Government will validate KPP & ATT performance through measurement and will initially accept in good faith the vendors opinion of a products potential. As the Government accumulates data and a materials potential recedes some products will drop from further consideration.  A Vendor can request reconsideration but they must provide at that time alternative measurement data to support their position.  D)	Is the Army willing to provide vendors with the source for the filter materials used to make the prototypes?  Yes, Contact information for the suppliers of the prototype item materials can be provided but the Government makes no commitment to later accept or use these prototype materials for the PPW.  The Governments expectation from the RFI is to see the full sp ectrum of potential material solutions. Also, to clarify, at this time a fabric suppliers only obligation is to their own business interests. Prior to a materials acceptance for production some licensing language will be considered.   E)	What is the timeframe for development of a new PPW if another vendor is chosen? The effort is not funded and so doesnt have a program plan with that level of detail.  The RFI should help define what can be done as an alternative material, product or help better defined our need for a new development program.   F)	Has the Army identified any design changes they would require for the existing 2005 design to be manufactured and deployed?  Are there any changes that are not necessary but perhaps desired that would not delay manufacturing or require a new round of te sting? Though there are no design concerns identified we have asked the user community to validate the adequacy of the current design. We cant know the impact on manufacturing until we have accepted candidate materials.  G)	Is there any KPP or ATT that the 2005 design does not meet? No, however with our improved abilities to make measurements and the new generation of available PPW materials some expectations have shifted and are the subject of ongoing discussion. H)	How many PPW will be required and ordered to fill the needs of the US Government? The total authorizations for the MES (Medical Equipment Set), Chemical Patient Treatment was 568.  There were 12 PPW per set. This gives a total of 6816 PPWs authorizations. This number will be distributed at a specific number per year for several years. I)	Will your office provide or identify the source for obtaining the following documents, please? 1.	A list of all known potential chemical warf are agents and their characteristics. No, for the purposes of this RFI the test standards (NFPA 1994, AVLAG TOP 8-2-501&etc) sufficiently identify the warfare agents of interest. CBIAC would be a good source for additional topic background information.  2.	The Standard for CB garment. No, we wish not to imply that the current standard garment performance might also baseline the PPW performance.  There are some fundamentally different requirements (duration of use, duration of protection, launderability etc&) for a garment.  3.	Are there also temperature requirements known for aircraft evacuation? Aircraft evac is not a requirement. 4.	Does the weight requirement mean only the wrap or does it include the blower assembly? The weight is for the wrap only. 5.	Where can the document identifying the specifics of weight, and the 5th percentile female and 95th percentile male be found? From the Human Engineering Design Data Digest.  It was published in April 2000 and is a quick reference extracted from MIL-STD-1472 and from MIL-HDBK-759 and the Federal Aviation Administration Human Factors Design Guide. 6.	Where can the size/dimensions of medical re-breathing mask and/or endotrachial incubation tubes be found? One source is from HUDSON RCI 2004-2005 Product Catalog.  For example we use their Cat No 1009 re-breather mask (adult size).  The current design accommodates the encapsulation of these items with the patient.  That fact will be validated. If theres an issue the government will provide appropriate design modification to alleviate the issue.      7.	Can you identify the specifications or document for JSLIST for flame resistant and associated POLs? Actually, neither the JSLIST nor the BDU have measurable FR performance. The intent here is to insure by comparison that the PPW materials dont introduce an observably worst performance FR behavior.  Petroleum, oil and lubricants (POLs) can potentially ca use material and protective performance degradation. So AVLAG TOP-2-501 calls for performance measurement of swatches treated with POLs. 8.	Where can a copy of AR 70-38 be obtained? Official Department of the Army Administrative Publications has it on there website just Google AR 70-38.  http://www.apd.army.mil/series_range_pubs.asp?range=70 9.	In the development testing stage using healthy subjects will the Army perform these tests or is the contractor required to do this? The Government will conduct any testing it requires and always reserves the right to validate, to its standards, any vendor supplied or other sourced performance data.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST has identified the Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation as a key component for overseas Consular windows, interviewing booths and staff offices.  The Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation was selected for this purpose because of the results obtained by Creative Information Technology, Inc. to replace a like number of older PCs used overseas in Consular interviewing booths and staff offices. The Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation is only small form factor workstation that fully meets Consular needs, and was selected for the following reasons: 1) It is a specific all-in-one configuration that includes three separate components: the Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation, a 19-inch Dell flat panel monitor, and a stand.  It occupies less than 1/3 of the space used by conventional mini-tower PCs deployed by the Bureau of Consular Affairs and eliminates overcrowding common to interviewing booths and visa issuance desks.  Moreover, the Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation provides additional space with an opening underneath the monitor that can be used for keyboard storage or to corral small office supplies. This space can be significantly useful to users with limited workspace.   2) It is the only small form factor PC manufactured that combines the screen display, processor, and all other components in one compact unit, while still allowing the components to separate from each other.  This feature is useful when one piece of the all-in-one configuration is malfunctioning and must be replaced.      3) The Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation complies with CA’s baseline standard for desktop PCs and is fully compatible with the Consular HW and SW environments. The following Consular Affairs overseas applications were tested for functionality: ACRS, ACS, ACS+, ST, CST_PWD, INK, IVO, and NIV. 4) The Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation has BTX (balance technology extended) chassis, power supply, and motherboard that are designed for thermal efficiency providing improved reliability and quieter operation. Dell’s HyperCool thermal management technology uses variable speed fans that provide optimal cooling with less power and enables quieter operation. 5) The workstation is a modular unit and uses industry standard components, which will decrease the amount of time needed service this workstation. The Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation offers a 2.8 GHz Pentium 4 processor, with an Intel 945G Express chipset. The Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation comes equipped with an 80 gigabyte SATA drive, and 512 MB of RAM<BR><BR>The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation has undergone test and assessment, evaluation for overseas deployments and received final approval from the Department of State Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board.<BR><BR>

NAICS Code: 541990

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION: The Tactical Technology Office (TTO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting proposals for advanced research and development of system and subsystem level technologies that enable revolutionary improvements to the efficiency and effectiveness of the military. The DARPA/TTO program will consider a broad range of technologies but focuses on the high risk/high payoff development and demonstration of complete systems or subsystems rather than advances in basic sciences. Proposed systems and subsystems need not be composed entirely of newly developed components, and may integrate new technology into existing systems and/or subsystems. 

AREAS OF INTEREST: DARPA/TTO priorities fall within five focus areas:  Advanced Platforms (Air, Sea, Space and Ground), Space Operations, Unmanned Systems, Directed Energy Systems, and Precision Strike Capabilities. The "Topics of Interest" attachment to this Announcement contains a number of representative technical concepts that are provided to give potential offerors additional guidance concerning current areas of interest to the office.  Other novel ideas that enhance military effectiveness and tilt the balance of modern warfare in favor of the US will also be considered. This BAA seeks new ideas, not necessarily extensions of the current programs. The range of programs managed by TTO has historically been broad. However, some proposals, particularly for devices, materials, and basic science, may be more appropriate to one or more of the other DARPA Offices listed at www.darpa.mil. Offerors are encouraged to look at http://www.darpa.mil/TTO for our current activities. At a later date, additional attachments may be provided which describe areas of special interest to the office; modifications will be published as these attachments are updated during the year. Offerors are encouraged to contact program managers and discuss their ideas and how they relate to TTO's focus areas. 


PROGRAM SCOPE: The Government plans to make $8.0M of FY 2007 funds available to fund projects under this BAA, though more may be made available. Multiple awards are anticipated from FY 2007 funds. For Government programmatic flexibility, offerors should segment their cost proposals into an initial 12-month (or shorter) phase which explores and validates the technical feasibility and tactical utility of the concept, and one or more phases proposed as optional efforts leading toward technology development. The total effort including options should not exceed five years. Successful initial phases will have a greater likelihood of receiving funding for subsequent optional phases. 
OFFERORS: Teaming is encouraged. An offeror may submit more than one proposal. Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside because of the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in innovative tactical technology. Proposals from US government entities, federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs), and other offerors who are proposing additional work under existing task order contracts will not be considered part of this BAA but may be evaluated by TTO separately from the BAA proposals. 

RESPONSES: This BAA solicits both white papers and proposals on proposed research. Prospective offerors are encouraged to contact the Technical POC or other TTO Program Managers to discuss areas of interest prior to submission of white papers or proposals. Offerors are strongly encouraged to submit white papers before submitting proposals. TTO responds to white papers with a recommendation based on the relevance to the TTO mission and a preliminary technical assessment. Regardless of the TTO recommendation based on its review of the white paper, an offeror may submit a proposal and that proposal will be reviewed and evaluated. Favorable response to a white paper is not an assurance that a full proposal on the white paper's topic will ultimately be selected for contract award. 

SCHEDULE: TTO will conduct an initial round of proposal receipt, evaluation, selection, and award. For the initial round of source selection, white papers should be submitted to TTO no later than 3-9-07. In order to be considered for an award during this first round, proposals must be received by TTO no later than 04-20-07. White papers received after 1600 local time 1-15-08 will not be evaluated under this BAA. The BAA will remain open for proposals through 1600 local time on the closing date, 2-28-08. Proposals received after the closing date will not be reviewed or evaluated. TTO will endeavor to respond to each white paper within forty-five (45) days after its receipt. As soon as the evaluation of a proposal is completed, the offeror will be notified that 1) the proposal has been selected for funding pending contract negotiations, or 2) the proposal has not been selected. One copy of each non-selected proposal will be retained for the files. Any additional copies of non-selected proposals will be destroyed upon non-selection. 

EVALUATION CRITERIA: Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a review using the following criteria: 1) potential contribution to the TTO mission; 2) overall scientific and technical merit including degree of innovation, understanding of the technical and operational issues, and experimental approach; 3) likelihood of transition to the military if technically successful; 4) offeror's capabilities and related experience, including qualifications and achievements of all team members and their key personnel, their capability to carry out further development and production, and the adequacy of facilities and equipment to be used for the proposed effort; 5) project plan; and 6) cost and cost realism. All proposals must first be deemed acceptable under criteria (1) to receive a full technical review.  Since no common work statement exists, each proposal will be evaluated on its own merit rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area.  


AWARDS: Awards under this BAA will be made to offerors on the basis of the evaluation criteria above and program balance to provide best value to the Government. Awards will be subject to the availability of funds. Award instruments may take the form of a procurement contract, grant, or agreement depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors. Phases after Phase I will be options, with pricing based on the cost proposal. An estimated cost for options beyond Phase I must be included or the options will not be considered. The Government reserves the right to 1) select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received, and 2) incrementally fund any award instrument. 

FORMAT AND SUBMITTAL: The form and format for white papers and proposals follows below. White papers and proposals that do not satisfy these form and format requirements or with differing content between their electronic and paper versions may be rejected without further review or evaluation. All submissions should be in the English language. White papers should be submitted electronically; a paper copy is not required. Proposals should also be submitted electronically but in addition, one paper copy of each proposal, accompanied by a transmittal letter signed by an official who is authorized to commit the offeror should be mailed to the address below. Electronic copies should be in PDF (preferred) or Microsoft Word format and submitted via a web site interface. Submission deadlines apply to both electronic and paper versions. All copies of white papers and proposals should be sent to: Web Site: https://www.tfims.darpa.mil/baa, Mail: DARPA, TTO, ATTN: BAA 07-20, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714. Proposals received by TTO but not submitted specifically to the BAA may be considered under the BAA.  Once a white paper or proposal has been submitted it will be reviewed and once a decision is made, written notification will be sent.  Proposers are warned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

WHITE PAPERS: The submission of a white paper is optional, but strongly recommended. A white paper should be a brief summary. It introduces the idea, solicits interaction with TTO, and avoids the expense of generating proposals that have little likelihood of selection within this BAA. White papers should summarize the planned proposal and clearly articulate the innovative concept or technology development being proposed. White papers should contain a cover sheet (clearly marked "White Paper"), a four page (maximum) summary of the technical idea, a one-page cost summary, and a one-paragraph (150-200 words) abstract of the white paper as a whole. All pages should be printable on 8 1/2 by 11 inch paper; type not smaller than 12 point. The page limitations for white papers include all figures, tables, and charts. No formal transmittal letter is required. Receipt will be confirmed. White papers should avoid proprietary or classified information or data not critical to the idea being presented. 


PROPOSALS: Each proposal shall consist of two volumes, Volume I - Technical, and Volume II - Cost. Volume I shall consist of a Cover Sheet, an abstract, and three sections.

CLASSIFIED SUBMISSIONS AND ITAR: DARPA/TTO will accept classified responses to this BAA when the classification is mandated by classification guidance provided by an Original Classification Authority of the U.S. Government, or when the proposer believes the work, if successful, would merit classification. Security classification guidance in the form of a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since DARPA is soliciting ideas only. If a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award. The point of contact for classified responses is the Director of TTO Security at 703-526-6708. Proposers who are unsure about the appropriate classification of their proposal should contact this POC before submitting a response. Information generated after award may be controlled under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR 120-130, therefore contractors may be required to protect information pursuant to the ITAR and are encouraged to consider this when proposing. 

HUMAN USE IN RESEARCH: Proposals selected for funding are required to comply with the provisions of the Common Rule (32 CFR 219) on the protection of human subjects in research (www.dtic.mil/biosys/downloads/32cfr219.pdf) and Department of Defense Directive 3216.2 (www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html2/d32162x.htm). All proposals that involve the use of human subjects are required to include documentation of their ability to follow federal guidelines for the protection of human subjects. This includes, but is not limited to, protocol approval mechanisms, approved Institutional Review Boards (IRB), and Federal Wide Assurances. These requirements are based on expected human use issues sometime during the entire length of the proposed effort. For proposals involving "greater than minimal risk" to human subjects within the first year of the project, performers must provide evidence of protocol submission to a federally approved IRB at the time of proposal submission to DARPA. For proposals that are forecasted to involve "greater than minimal risk" after the first year, a discussion on how and when the proposer will comply with submission to a federally approved IRB needs to be provided in the submission. More information on applicable federal regulations can be found at the Department of Health and Human Services - Office of Human Research Protections website (http://www.dhhs.gov/ohrp). 

ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST: Awards made under this BAA are subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest. All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any DARPA technical office(s) through either:  (1) an active DARPA contract or subcontract; or (2) an active contract or subcontract administered on DARPA's behalf by another Government agent. All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports and identify the prime contract number. Affirmations shall be furnished at the time of proposal submission, and the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in FAR 9.501, must be disclosed. This disclosure shall include a description of the action the offeror has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict. If the offeror believes that no such conflict exists, then the offeror shall so state in the affirmation. 
NON-GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL: All proprietary material should be clearly marked and will be held in strict confidence. Restrictive notices notwithstanding, proposals may be handled, for administrative purposes only, by a support contractor, which is bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants and experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. Non-Government technical consultants will not have access to proposals that are labeled by the offerors as - GOVERNMENT ONLY. Evaluations and selections under this BAA will be made only by Government evaluators. 

SUBMISSION INFORMATION: DARPA/TTO will employ an electronic upload process, the Technical Financial Information Management System (T-FIMS) Proposal Submission System, for all proposal submissions. All material submitted through T-FIMS must be UNCLASSIFIED. Please DO NOT attempt to submit CLASSIFIED proposal material through the electronic upload process as this is PROHIBITED. Offerors that intend to include classified, or potentially classified, information or data as part of their proposals shall submit an UNCLASSIFIED PROPOSAL referring to a classified annex. The offeror should contact the Technical POC for this BAA, or the TTO Security POC cited above, for guidance on submitting the classified annex. Content of proposal submissions made through T-FIMS must be UNCLASSIFIED. 


The web site http://www.darpa.mil/tto/solicitations.htm contains guidance for proposal submission. Organizations must register at: http://www.tfims.darpa.mil/baa to submit a proposal. Only the lead or prime organization should register. One registration per proposal should be submitted. Organizations wishing to submit multiple proposals should complete a single registration for each proposal. The deadline for registration for the electronic submission is 31 December 2007 at the registration Uniform Resource Locator (URL) listed above. By registering, the Proposer has made no commitment to submit. 

The T-FIMS Proposal Submission System can support the following file formats: Portable Document Format (pdf), Word Document (doc), Plain Text (txt), Comma-separated Values (csv), PowerPoint Presentation (ppt), Excel Worksheet (xls), and Excel Workspace (xlw). PDF is the preferred format. Proposal submissions made through the T-FIMS Proposal Submission System must be no larger than 50 megabytes per file. This means that the Technical Volume file, as well as the Cost Volume file, must not exceed 50 megabytes, individually, as the T-FIMS program will not allow it.

Within the U.S. Census Bureau, the Economic Planning and Coordination Division (EPCD) has a requirement for advisory and assistance services in order to maintain and improve coverage of complex multi-establishment enterprises on the Business Register.  The Business Register serves as the enumeration list for the economic census and as a sampling frame for economic surveys.  It is also used for the storage of administrative data.  The desired improvements include the improvement and expansion on the 2002 implementation of the redesigned Business Register.  

The major objectives of this project focus on more complete and up-to-date coverage of complex multi-units; improved representation of multilevel and multidimensional organization hierarchies; the addition of statistical units for subsidiary companies, divisions and other intermediate units; expanded use of Federal administrative records and other alternatives to direct collection; increased effectiveness and reduced burden for the annual Company Organization Survey (COS); improved efficiency for register maintenance operations; and strengthened support for the economic censuses? and survey?s efforts to measure this critical part of the business population.  The results of this work will support EPCD?s maintenance and coverage of the multi-establishment enterprises on the Business Register.  The Census Bureau has obtained this support in the past from Alfred R. Brand, Jr.

Interested parties should submit a detailed statement of their qualifications, not exceeding 15 pages, for providing the required support by e-mail to Maxine R. Hodges at Maxine.R.Hodges@census.gov by 3:00 pm, EST, Friday, January 19, 2007.

<CONTACT>Olivia Adrian Contract Specialist 7037871151     Olivia.Adrian@mms.gov;
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.001 (a) (2) (ii) to conduct a Market Research before soliciting offers for an acquisition with an estimated value in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold and FAR Part 10.002 (b) (2)(iii) Publishing formal requests for information in appropriate technical or scientific journals or business publications.  The Government's intent, based on the information received from this RFI is to make a determination to issue Solicitation as a 100% small business set-aside or full and open competition.  The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential small business sources that are interested in and capable of satisfying the Agency's requirements described herein.  Please note that this requirement is subject to the availability of funds.  The result of this RFI notice will help determine if sources capable of satisfying the agency's requirements exist. Additionally, it is not the Government's intention to enter into a contract based on this notice or otherwise pay for information solicited. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This RFI is for planning purposes only, and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Minerals Management Service (MMS).  The primary purpose of this notice is to improve small business access to acquisition information, to enhance competition and identify potential small businesses (for contracting and subcontracting opportunities) that are interested and capable of performing the work described below.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 541620, "Environmental Consulting Services". Firms responding to this RFI should state whether they are a small business concern, as defined by Small Business Association Size Standard for the NAICS 541620 is $6.5M.  Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the evaluation of the information received.  MMS will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to the subject of this RFI. BACKGROUND:  	The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has promulgated more stringent National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone and particulate matter (PM2.5) and has also proposed new regional haze regulations to improve visibility.  The changes to these standards/regulations may require state agencies to perform air quality photochemical modeling for ozone and regional haze for use in their State Implementation Plans (SIPs).  In order to conduct this modeling, emission inventories must be generated as inputs to the models.  The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) specifies that states are to prepare emission inventories every three years, starting in 1996.  The collection and compilation of an air emissions inventory is one of the tasks that MMS conducts to assure coordination of air pollution control regulations between Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) offshore sources and state's sources onshore (as per Section 328(b) of the 1990 CAAA).   The Minerals Management Service (MMS) is responsible for providing the Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) emissions data from both stationary platform sources, as well as other non-platform sources, such as; exploration, construction, transportation, lightering, and supply vessels. Currently, the Gulf coast states air quality agencies and central/southeast states regional planning organizations use the MMS calendar year 2000 emission inventory for the offshore portion in air quality modeling and SIP development.  However, the year 2000 did not correspond to one of the onshore triennial periodic emissions inventory years (e.g., year 2002).  To correct this discrepancy and to update the 2000 emission inventory, the 2005 emissions inventory study was conducted.   Because of the widespread damage in the Gulf of Mexico by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita during the summer of 2005, the Year 2005 Gulfwide Emission Inventory is not complete, may be inaccurate, and is certainly atypical.    Both the 2000 and 2005 emission inventory efforts included using the Gulfwide Offshore Activities Data System (GOADS) software to collect, perform quality control, and archive activity data from platform sources that emit air pollutants.  The Database Management Software (DBMS) is an Oracle based tool that was developed to calculate and archive emissions data, using the most current AP-42 emissions factors and the activity data from GOADS.  In addition, Gulfwide activity data from OCS non-platform sources was collected for both these calendar years.   The proposed 2008 Gulfwide emissions inventory will correspond with the next EPA onshore periodic emissions inventory.  Due to the more stringent NAAQS, it is likely that many of the regions adjacent to the Gulf of Mexico will face even greater challenges in attaining air quality standards in their respective states in 2008.  The year 2008 emissions inventory will be made available to assist states and regional planning organizations with modeling for additional SIP demonstrations to meet these challenges. Thus, the collection and compilation of an emissions inventory for OCS sources in 2008 is imperative, in that it provides MMS the essential tools to comply with the Congressional mandate:  coordinating air pollution control regulations between OCS offshore and states onshore sources.  Also, the inventory will be used to augment the MMS NEPA process by providing a more accurate inventory to compute emission trends and to perform necessary air quality impacts assessments. PURPOSE:  The MMS has a requirement for a study that shall provide a calendar year 2008 activity database and calculated emissions data for NAAQS criteria pollutants- carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter-10 (PM10), particulate matter-2.5 (PM2.5), all VOC, including exempted compounds (40 CFR 51.100), as well as greenhouse gases- carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N20).  This emissions data is needed to support ozone and regional haze modeling, the NEPA process, and global climate change issues, over Federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico OCS west of 87.5°W longitude.  Specific objectives of this study are to:  (1) review and recommend the modification of and provide support services for GOADS and DBMS, (2) collect, describe, quality check, quality assure, and archive activity data from all platform and non-platform sources over the OCS that emit air pollutants during one (1) calendar year (2008), (3) calculate the calendar year 2008 total emissions inventory using the most current AP-42 emissions factors for all specified platform and non-platform sources, and (4) to compare the emissions inventory with previously collected emissions data. STUDY PERSONNEL REQUIREMENTS:  Scientific personnel must possess extensive expertise in the knowledge of air quality of the Gulf of Mexico region, oil and gas industry, oil production platform equipment, non-platform air emissions sources on the OCS, conducting air emissions inventories, and EPA regulations and submittal procedures.  This expertise must be demonstrated through successful completion of projects comparable to this one and authorship in peer-reviewed scientific publications.  Specific knowledge of Visual Basic Windows and Oracle are needed to support the existing software used to gather platform activity data (GOADS-1) and calculate the total emissions (DBMS-1).  This knowledge should include programming to revise the existing software if necessary, plus understanding the programming languages and software to perform the necessary actions to calculate the high quality emission inventory.  Specific knowledge of MS-Access is needed to place the data in the needed format, or the EPA National Emissions Inventory Input Format (NIF).  This knowledge should be demonstrated through past successful projects similar in scope and size. SOURCES SOUGHT:  Interested organizations should submit a response with approximately 20-page or less that provides information about the small business firm's ability to perform all aspects of the effort described above.  Emphasis should be placed on prior experience conducting projects of similar scope and complexity, and publications recorded in peer-reviewed scientific journals.  All proprietary information should be marked accordingly.  Responses will be reviewed by MMS personnel and will be held in a confidential manner. RESPONSES:  Your response must be delivered as: one (1) original plus three (3) hard copies and two (2) electronic/diskette copies (CD MS/Word/PDF), total of four (4) hard copies and two (2) CDs.  Response due date: not later than close of business (COB), 5 P.M.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. BASED ON CAPABILITY STATEMENTS RECEIVED FROM THIS SOURCES SOUGHT THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE OR AS FULL AND OPEN. ALL SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, and SDVOSB) ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE.  SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS MUST HAVE THEIR SIZE STATUS CERTIFIED BY THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION.  THE NAICS CODE IS 541710 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES.   

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious diseases.  The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), supports a comprehensive extramural research program focused on the prevention and control of diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents (with the exception of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus).  This includes basic research, such as studies of microbial biology and physiology; applied research, including the development of vaccines, therapeutics and medical diagnostics; as well as clinical studies to evaluate experimental drugs and vaccines.

Recent threats of the use of infectious agents as biological weapons have generated increased concern for the safety of the general American populace.  Bacillus anthracis (B. anthracis) is the etiologic agent of anthrax.  The ability to generate high titer anthrax spores using basic microbiological techniques combined with the ability of these agents to be disseminated by aerosolization, has made anthrax a primary bioterrorist and military threat.  With the deliberate exposure of citizens of the United States to B. anthracis spores in 2001, there is an urgent need to stockpile appropriate and effective medical countermeasures to protect all U.S. citizens from the morbidity and mortality associated with infection from these instruments of terror.  

The NIAID is seeking capability statements from sources that are capable of advanced development and testing of anthrax vaccine candidates which build upon the second generation vaccine, and have properties desirable for a biodefense vaccine to be stored in the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS).  These properties include long-term stability (i.e., three years or longer) at room temperature, the ability to generate a protective immune response in one or two doses, and the ability to be safely self-administered and/or rapidly inoculated into large numbers of people.  Anthrax vaccine candidates eligible for support under this solicitation shall possess all or some of these properties while maintaining a superior safety profile to the currently U.S. licensed anthrax vaccine.  Novel formulations/final vaccine presentation, new delivery platforms, adjuvants other than aluminum, and inclusion of antigens in addition to protective antigen (PA) may be components of candidate vaccines.

The project involves:  (1) manufacture and testing of anthrax vaccine candidates possessing some/all of the characteristics described above; (2) production of vaccine components and final product at pilot-lot scale; (3) characterization and testing including a stability program; (4) one or more pre-clinical safety studies required for the filing of an Investigational New Drug application (IND); (5) non-clinical aerosol spore challenge studies using rabbit and non-human primate models; (6) one option for the design and conduct of a Phase 1 dose escalating clinical trial in healthy subjects ages 18 to 40; and (7) one option for up to two Phase 2 clinical trials in healthy subjects ages 18 to 55.  If a novel device for vaccine delivery is proposed, contract funds may be utilized to suitably formulate the candidate vaccine for the device; however, funds may not be used for developing a device. This RFP will require that a Premarket Approval Application (PMA) or a Premarket Notification Form 510K must be currently filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for such devices and documentation provided in the Technical Proposal. 

Capability statements submitted in response to this notice will be evaluated in accordance with  each organizations demonstrated and documented capabilities as follows:  (1) documentation that the proposed anthrax vaccine candidate has a  purified Protective antigen (PA) that has been shown to be efficacious against B. anthracis spore challenge in animal models, the proposed vaccine must contain a PA component.  The PA component may be proteinaceous or nucleotide-encoded; (2) documentation supporting the vaccine candidates development status relating to established Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) pilot-scale production of a clinical grade material suitable for use in Phase 1/2 clinical trials; (3) justification for further development of the proposed candidate vaccine as it relates to the objectives of this RFP (improved safety profile, rapid and robust titers in no more than two doses, elimination of cold chain/long-term stability, and ease of delivery for use in an emergency event) is warranted, while maintaining an improved safety/reactogenicity profile over the current licensed vaccine and at least equivalent efficacy; (4) demonstration of the availability and adequacy of facilities for cGMP drug substance (DS) and cGMP final drug product (FDP) manufacturing at pilot-lot manufacturing scale. For this effort, pilot-scale DS fermentation is defined as a minimum of 30 liter working volume and/or sufficient DS to fill 2,000 doses of FDP. FDP is defined as a minimum of 2,000 final doses per single lot run. Potential sources proposing methodology for DS production other than fermentation must provide documentation to indicate that current yield is of equivalent quantity as above requirements.  Pilot-lot scale processes must be readily transferable to large scale manufacture; (5) documentation of previous experience in developing and conducting non-clinical development plans to evaluate safety and efficacy of vaccine candidates that includes the conduct of all FDA required Investigational New Drug application (IND) enabling studies; and (6) documentation of previous experience in developing and executing clinical development plans to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of vaccine candidates.

It is estimated that the provision of FTEs will be approximately as follows:  13 FTE for Base Year 1 & 2; Reduced to 7.55 FTEs for Base Year 3; 2.1 FTEs for Year 3--Option 1; 2.1 FTEs for each Option 2—Years 4-7.  The Option periods could increase the contract value and extend the contract by up to four years.  Interested organizations should submit two copies of their capability statement addressing each of the areas cited above. Any proprietary information should be so marked.  Interested organizations presenting a capability statement in response to this sources sought announcement must identify their size status (i.e. educational institution, non-profit, large business, small business, 8(a), or other corporate or non-corporate entity).  Written capability statements should be received by the Contracting Officer by May 23, 2006.   Please reference the solicitation number on all related correspondence.  No collect calls will be accepted. Facsimile and e-mail transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 25.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, ALOSH, Morgantown, WV, and Pathology and Physiology Research Branch (PPRB) in collaboration with the Division of Respiratory Disease Studies (DRDS) is conducting a study to elucidate the molecular mechanism that constitutes the basis for chronic beryllium disease (CBD). Together they were awarded funding to conduct studies specifically designed to compare the adverse effects of different types of beryllium and to gather dose response data. Until recently, no animal model for CBD existed. HELD scientists identified three members of the HLA-DPB1 gene family that were suitable to genetically engineer mouse model of CBD, a transgenic mouse called the CBD mouse model.  Department of Energy (DOE) supported scientists at Lawrence Berkley National Laboratories and New York University developed and refined the CBD mouse model. The model consists of three mouse strains (one for each of the HLA-DPB1 family members, designated: *0201, *0401 and *1701).

The study being conducted by HELD and DRDS has multiple objectives, these are: 1) to provide a validated transgenic mouse model of CBD for the research community, to be disseminated through JAX Labs. Inc.; 2) to provide data concerning the differential toxicity of beryllium materials in the mouse model that can be used for informed control technology decisions; 3) to provide data to support or refute skin as a route of exposure for beryllium sensitization so that appropriate preventive actions can be implemented in beryllium-exposed industries; 4) to provide data related to the differential susceptibility conferred by specific genotypes so that preventive strategies can be devised for the most susceptible populations. In order to accomplish the objectives, it is necessary to have a genuine CBD mouse model exposed to beryllium.

The purpose of this purchase order is to secure the services of an immunotoxicology expert to conduct exposure of the beryllium mouse model to different doses and different types of beryllium, and via different routes of administration (primarily skin versus lung). The outcome of the experiments will be measured by pathological quantification of lung granulomata and inflammation in animals sacrificed at 4 and 7 months. These outcomes will be determined by PPRB scientists in HELD/NIOSH. After validation of the animal model of CBD, dermal exposure will be evaluated as a possible route of sensitization. Based on an extensive literature search, we are confident that New York University School of Medicine is currently the only facility with a credible CBD mouse model, comprising three mouse strains with genetically engineered changes through ?knock-in? of members of the HLA-DPB1 gene family involved in CBD (one for each of the HLA-DPB1 family members, designated: *0201, *0401 and *1701).

This notice is issued for informational purposes only.  Any interested party must demonstrate in writing their ability to meet the requirements outlined above to the contracting officer no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of this announcement.  Submit information to Rebecca Mullenax, Reference: 000HCCHB-2007-40608, DHHS/PHS/CDC/NIOSH/ALOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505 or Fax to 304-285-6083 or e-mail RMULLENAX@CDC.GOV.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any sources exist, therefore, no solicitation will be issued.  A determination by the Contracting Officer not to compete this action is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received within 15 days, award will be made to New York University School of Medicine  without further notices being issued.

<DESC>This is a market survey and sources sought synopsis to identify firms with experience, capability and resources to provide food distribution services as described below in the Statement of Need.  

STATEMENT OF NEED

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's foremost federally funded biomedical research institution.  NIH is comprised of twenty-seven Institutes, Centers, and Divisions.  The Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center (CRC) is the onsite hospital for the NIH campus, providing full support for clinical research in inpatient and outpatient settings.  The CRC comprises three million square feet of clinical, laboratory, and administrative space with the capacity to provide full hospital support for inpatients participating in research studies at the NIH. The CRC includes a modern research facility with a 250-bed hospital, outpatient care capability and research laboratories.
The Nutrition Department of the CRC is committed to providing the best possible patient care and research support for patients undergoing research at the NIH. Registered Dietitians provide an array of patient-care services, including nutrition assessments, counseling services, and enteral and parenteral feeding recommendations. Research support services include protocol design, dietary intake assessment, body composition analysis, data analysis, and interpretation. In addition, dietitians pursue adjunct research interests related to protocols and may serve as principal investigators for research questions related to the practice of dietetics. 
Clinical Center patients, whether on an inpatient unit, a day hospital bed or in the outpatient clinics are offered meals and nourishments to meet individualized needs.  The Nutrition Department utilizes CBORD, a state-of-the-art integrated food management computer system to service regular and therapeutic diets, as well as diets for research protocols. This technology allows for the integration of varied clinical and research needs through over 100 diet types, nutrition analysis of intakes, and the ability to easily change the menu to take advantage of seasonal foods and changing patient preferences.   Most patients have very involved dietary restrictions as a result of being on highly specialist research protocols.  In order to ensure the integrity of the research protocols and to comply with JCAHO, all ingredients for food required/procured must be reviewed by a registered dietitian.
The Nutrition Department in the CRC, at the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland has a continuing need for a contractor to provide food distribution services.  The Government requires the following:


On line ordering with the capability to review ingredient contents for all food and proposed substitutions on line is required.  Government Dietitians/Production Manager will receive immediate notice of any product that is not available at the time of the product order.  24-48 hour advanced notice of product substitutions is required to be provided by the contractor to the Government representatives. All substitutions must be reviewed and approved by a registered dietitian/manager in advance of delivery.  (In the event that an appropriate food substitute cannot be provided, the Government reserves the right to purchase required items from another vendor).

A Monday, Wednesday, Friday delivery schedule is required.  All Food ordered must be delivered between 6:00am-8:30am.  Food should be ordered for next day delivery.  For example, food ordered on Tuesday for a Wednesday delivery, order Thursday for a Friday delivery and order Friday for a Monday delivery (basically the day before). 

The Contractor must also be able to supply nutritional supplements when requested by the Government. 
 OBJECTIVE:  The Government?s object for this market survey/sources sought synopsis is to identify food supply distribution service contractors who have the capability and capacity to provide services to the Nutrition Department with the greatest possible accuracy, efficiency and consideration for patient health and safety. 
The listing of food supplies and estimated average quantities represent usage over the last 12 months and are posted as a separate file on FedBiz Opps.   NOTE:  These are only estimated quantities and may vary significantly depending on the patient census and specific research protocols being conducted at the NIH.
This is a SOURCES SOUGHT announce only, and your response is not an offer. All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary. The Government will not pay for the information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in the preparation or submission of industry responses. Solicitations are not available at this time, and as such any requests for solicitations will not receive a response. Information collected via this market survey will in no way be used to limit or screen potential offerors from future consideration for selection.  Information provided by any offeror in response to this market review shall not be disclosed if doing so would reveal the vendor?s confidential business strategy and will be protected under FAR 3.104 or FAR Subpart 24. 2. All proprietary and restricted information provided in response to this synopsis should be clearly marked.  

Please submit a detailed capability statement which should be pertinent and specific in the area of providing the services described herein. The capability statement shall be in sufficient enough detail so that the Government can determine the experience and capability of your firm to provide the required services at fair market prices. Information provided should include but not be limited to the following:  a). A detailed statement outlining the necessary knowledge, skills and abilities of the vendor to provide the required food supply/distribution services within the required timeframes  b) When discussing experience in providing food supply distribution services, the capability statement should identify on-going and/or previous contracts performed providing food supply distribution services to comparably sized hospitals, including a brief description, duration, dollar value, client?s name and address, telephone number and name of contact persons.  c) Available vendor resources for providing the required services-including automated resources for receiving and tracking orders placed,  and any other equipment and supplies needed for providing the services such as trucks for delivering supplies, etc.  Additionally, pricing (which may include price lists) for providing the proposed food supply distribution services should be provided.
Information provided need not be excessive in length, but should be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate that your company fully understands the nature and scope of the food distribution services required and has the expertise and resources to successfully perform the required food distribution services as described herein..  The NAICS and small business size thresholds for this requirement are 4224410 and 500 employees is the small business size standard.  Responding companies should advise if they are considered a large or small business based upon the size standards provided.  Additionally, any small business firms should further identify whether they are 8a, HUBZONE, veteran or woman-owned, etc.  Please address responses to Ms. Deborah Culpepper, Contract Specialist, National Institutes of Health, Materials Management Department, Building 10, Room B1N238, 10 Center Drive, Bethesda, Maryland 20892 or via e-mail to dculpepper@cc.nih.gov.

    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

incorporated entity; or

    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>TECHNICAL POC:  David Kuehn, 202/366-6072 or david.kuehn@dot.gov  This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) describes a 2-phase process for proposal submission and evaluation. In the first phase, short pre-proposals will be submitted for review. The pre-proposals that are of interest to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) will be asked to submit full proposals. IMPORTANT DATES: (1) Pre-Proposals due APR 30, 2007, 4:00pm EST; (2) Full Proposals Invitations issued on/about MAY 29, 2007; (3) Full Proposals due on/about JUN 25, 2007; (4) final awards are anticipated in AUG/SEP 2007. OBJECTIVES/DESCRIPTION: The FHWA is soliciting proposals for R&D projects that could lead to transformational changes and revolutionary advances for transportation planning in the US. The objective is to advance the practice and application of transportation planning among state, regional and local transportation planning agencies in response to significant changes in the planning process and to identify new tools, techniques and approaches that respond to national transportation planning priorities. PROGRAM SCOPE: The program scope is intentionally broad to address the wide spectrum of topics and objectives that the funded investigations can support, and is intended to spur innovation and focus on high risk and high pay-off R&D projects. Incremental advances and demonstrations of existing technologies are not within the scope of this program. FOCUS AREAS: Five focus areas within transportation planning are of particular strategic interest and relevance to the FHWA. Proposals in these areas are highly encouraged. This guidance is offered to help offerors in the development of proposals of particular interest to FHWA. The areas as consistent with emphasis areas identified for the Surface Transportation Environment and Planning Cooperative Research Program developed under Section 5207 of Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users; see http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/hep/step/index.htm for more information.  
The 5 focus areas include: (1)CONGESTION MANAGEMENT: In this area, the objective is to support the national strategy to reduce congestion on America's transportation network as well as support other initiatives to link operations and planning. Research could focus on road/congestion pricing and private sector involvement in transportation investment, and management and operations.  Research could support work to advance analysis tools for use in the evaluation of operational improvements and strategies in transportation planning, advance the Congestion Management Process, and provide for information dissemination on these topics. Research also could result in the development of new tools and programs for understanding, analyzing and responding to congestion problems. (2) SAFETY PLANNING: Transportation safety is by nature a multi-disciplinary endeavor, requiring coordination among engineering, law enforcement, public education, and emergency services professionals, who may not share a history of close working relationships. Holistic, comprehensive planning for transportation safety must find solutions to safety problems that effectively blend strategies from these four disciplines. In the past few years, events have re-shaped the institutional environment in which transportation safety planning occurs, including requirements for Strategic Highway Safety Plans, a stand-alone planning factor in the federally-required transportation planning process, and continual improvements in data collection. In this environment, planners must play key roles in identifying strategies to be funded with transportation dollars. The objective of this research is to help transportation planners determine how to best incorporate safety into the transportation planning process and identify the effective combinations of transportation safety strategies according to local conditions. Key areas of focus will be research to improve safety data collection and management, to assess the impact of elected officials in promoting safety goals within transportation planning processes and to develop analysis tools and methods to support transportation safety planning on tribal lands. Note an area that received attention from stakeholders in response to an announcement of STEP: improving safety for non-motorized travelers where research could develop new tools and methods for use in bringing an analytical approach to transportation safety. (3)FREIGHT PLANNING: Across most of the country, freight movements are growing as a share of transportation system volumes. The objective of this research is to promote the integration of freight into the transportation planning and programming processes at the State and metropolitan levels. Freight transportation issues are complex and involve many stakeholders who have different perspectives on the freight transportation system. Educating and training a skilled and knowledgeable workforce is crucial to increasing freight transportation productivity. Research could focus on how to effectively engage the private sector freight community into the State and metropolitan planning processes; how parameters such as price, travel time, permitting, and user fees affect modal shift; what elasticities are inherent in these parameters; and the benefits/cost analyses of freight projects. Research also could develop new tools and programs such as freight analytical techniques, freight modeling improvements, methods of innovative freight data collection and data sharing, as well as pilot projects. (4) PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT, ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE, VISUALIZATION IN PLANNING: There is a continued need for assessing changes and demonstrating the use of new methods in public involvement and community impact assessment practice. Environmental justice and visualization are emerging areas of research and practice for transportation planning practitioners. There is increasing awareness among state departments of transportation, metropolitan planning organizations and other government agencies of the importance of ensuring civil rights and environmental justice in the transportation planning process where there is a greater opportunity for making trade-offs to avoid impacts. Visualization applied to transportation planning is an emerging area of both research and practice. Stakeholders from state departments of transportation, metropolitan planning organizations and other interested parties are concerned about how to effectively apply visualization. Most agencies and practitioners have little or no awareness of examples. Research in visualization could result in (a) successful methods for adopting visualization and (b) demonstration of improved communication between transportation practitioners, decision-makers and the public. (5) TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES THAT SUPPORT STATE, LOCAL, TRIBAL PLANNING CAPACITY BUILDING: In this area, research needs to demonstrate a clear understanding of audience needs, agency practices and process requirements in statewide and metropolitan transportation planning. Key planning research issues for State Departments of Transportation include asset management and program cost management. Research may include demonstrations or process enhancements. Key research issues for metropolitan transportation planning include growth such as rapidly urbanizing rural areas outside current metropolitan boundaries, managing program finances and revenue, and coordination with new planning partners. Research may include development of process improvements or decision-support tools.  In small communities and rural areas, transportation planning research may focus on issues such as the interaction with the statewide transportation planning process and may include toolkits or demonstrations. For Tribal transportation planning, the objective of the coordinated research approach will be the development of appropriate tools or approaches that will promote the integration of tribal issues into the transportation planning and programming processes at the State and metropolitan levels.  Examples of research may include development of "Information Tools" for use by Tribal departments of transportation demonstrating effective consultation practices in the statewide and metropolitan transportation planning process. Transportation planning research also could include issues that cut across processes such as land use and transportation. Research in this area should focus on effective applications of both technical and non-technical approaches and tools and addressing jurisdictional and institutional issues. This research may include the development of new or enhanced planning tools to provide a framework for developing a shared vision for the future by analyzing various forces (e.g., health, transportation, economic, environmental, land use, etc.) that affect growth. Research also may develop new tools and programs such as land use and transportation models, as well as pilot applications. GENERAL PROPOSAL INFORMATION:  All administrative correspondence should be directed to the contracting officer identified below. The FHWA has budgeted approximately $650,000.00 in FY2007 to fund this research program. Proposals will be evaluated using a two-part process consisting of pre-proposals and full-proposals. Offerors whose pre-proposals are of interest to FHWA will be invited to submit full proposals. Offerors who have been notified by FHWA that their proposals are not of interest may also submit full proposals if they wish. The FHWA anticipates making multiple awards, typically of 12 to 24 month duration with the size of individual contract or purchase order awards varying from $50,000 to over $100,000 depending on the research area and study requirements. Awards with a total value (including full period of performance and any option periods) of $100,000 or under will be issued as purchase orders. Awards over $100,000 will be issued as contracts, cooperative agreements, or grants. The FHWA strongly encourages cost sharing under any contract that may result, and can offer cooperative agreements or grants when there is a significant non-federal source of funding. For cooperative agreements or grants, the Federal share of the cost of a project or activity carried out under this program is limited by Section 5101(b) of SAFETEA-LU to fifty (50) percent, unless otherwise determined by the Secretary of Transportation. The FHWA may select for award all, none, or a subset of the acceptable proposals to construct a balanced program meeting its needs.  The number of awards, and their dollar value, will vary depending on the merit of proposals received and their potential to lead to transformational changes and advances in transportation planning practice. Offerors should prepare proposals with a baseline period of performance of 12 to 24 months and, if needed, with one or more options up to an additional 24 month period of performance. EVALUATION CRITERIA: The primary basis for selecting proposals will be technical merit, importance to FHWA programs, and fund availability. Technical merit will be evaluated based on the following criteria, listed in descending order of relative importance: Understanding of current practice, trends and future needs relative to the research; Value of research to advance practitioners involved in statewide, Tribal, metropolitan, local and small community transportation planning; Fit of research in meeting recent changes in the transportation planning process and national planning priorities; Impact of research on meeting current or future transportation planning needs; Cost-effective use of federal funds; and Experience and qualifications of the research team for conducting national-level research. The FHWA strongly encourages proposals that offer a significant non-federal matching funds or in-kind resources. Such proposals will receive consideration in addition to and above how they respond to the technical criteria above. Cost reasonableness and realism will also be considered in the overall selection process. Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under the announcement. Selection will be based primarily on scientific or technical merit, partnership, relevance and importance to agency, and availability of funds. Note that all technically meritorious proposals may not be funded due to budgetary constraints. PRE-PROPOSAL & FULL PROPOSAL PROCESS: Proposals may respond to one or more of the subject areas. Offerors may also submit more than one proposal when the proposed effort includes multiple disparate objectives and tasks, covers multiple or disparate technologies areas, or would have a more supportable budget if provided in parts; however, each proposal will be considered independently. FHWA will evaluate pre-proposals against the evaluation criteria outlined above. Those offerors whose pre-proposals are of interest may be invited to submit a formal full-proposal, as described below. Offerors whose pre-proposals are determined not to be of interest may submit a full proposals if they desire. Approximately 30 days after the pre-proposal submission deadline, offerors submitting pre-proposals will be contacted by the Technical POC, either with a letter informing them either that the FHWA is requesting a formal cost and technical proposal or that the effort proposed is not of interest to the Government. The FHWA may select for award all, none, or a subset of the acceptable proposals to construct a balanced program meeting its needs. It will be of added value for the proposing organization's management to demonstrate flexibility in support of this approach. Examples of support are strong internal backing with matching funds, innovative approaches in contracting and leveraging current and past technology development efforts that support this program. PRE-PROPOSAL SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS: Pre-proposals must be submitted via electronic mail, and must be received by the FHWA on or before 4:00 PM (EST), April 30, 2007, in order to be considered funding.

Description:  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Responses reflecting availability of the service as described are requested in the form of a quote.  This requirement is a total small business set-aside.  The NAICS code is 314999 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  The due date for quotes is Friday, March 9, 2007 at 3:00 p.m. Eastern time.  Quotes shall be submitted electronically to the identified point of contact at shaundra.duggans@va.gov. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides interment flags to veteran's families for burial ceremonies upon request.  Although the Department is in the process of awarding definite quantity contracts for interment flags, our reserve quantities have fallen below the standard minimum by a quantity of 172,014 flags. As such, VA needs to replenish its inventory immediately and will accept responses ONLY from offerors who have successfully provided flags to the Department on prior awards. The Department intends to award a fixed price definite quantity contract (s) for the replenishment of this inventory.   Item Description: 5-foot hoist by 9-foot 6- inch flag in accordance with the Federal Specification DDD-F-416E dated 5 August 1996. National Stock Number (NSN) 8345- 00-656-1432 -FLAG, NATIONAL, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, INTERMENT, with the Government specified changes as directed by the VA.  The Standard for Yarn, Duck Page 2-6 of the specification was changed from (and is for this procurement) 84 to 34 yarns per inch for Cotton and Cotton-Polyester. In accordance with Public law (P .L.) 105-261, Section 1073, the interment (burial) flags must be wholly produced in the United States from material wholly grown, created, and assembled in the United States. Mere compliance with the Buy American Act and Trade Agreement Act and the incorporated provisions in FAR 52.212-3 and FAR 52.2212-5 will NOT be sufficient to comply with the public law cited above. A copy of the specification for the stock numbered item and the aforementioned public law are attachments 1 and 2 to the RFQ. All metric conversions shall be in accordance with the Institute of Heraldry Metric Conversion Table dated 10 February 1997 which is available from the contract specialist upon request. Note: Interested offerors shall contact Shaundra Duggans at Shaundra.Duggans@va.gov to receive copies of Attachments 1 and 2.  7. Evaluation: All quotes shall be submitted in two (2) separate volumes as follows: Volume I (Technical Quote) - All Offerors shall include information on their ability and means to furnish the proposed quantity of flags to the delivery destination, including information on supply/service availability from first and second tier suppliers of finished material, flag weaving and embroidery, if any. The Offeror shall affirmatively state in the quote that all flags furnished will conform to the federal specification (as modified in the item description); the public law (PL 105-261 section 1073); and the non-manufacturer rule (FAR 19.001) which states: "In the performance of the contract, the product described in the statement of work herein (Interment Flag) must be the product of a small business manufacturer or producer. The end product furnished must be manufactured or produced in the United States or its outlying areas. The term "nonmanufacturer" includes a concern that can, but elects not to, manufacture or produce the end product for the specific acquisition. For size determination purposes, there can be only one manufacturer of the end product being acquired. The manufacturer of the end product being acquired is the concern that, with its own forces, transforms inorganic or organic substances including raw materials and/or miscellaneous parts or components into the end product." To be considered a responsible offeror, each contractor submitting quotes for this requirement shall have successfully provided interment flags to VA on a previously awarded contract and have included that contract number in the Technical volume of the quote submission. As such, flags submitted under this requirement will not be subjected to first article testing by the Government. The contract resulting from this RFQ requires delivery on the 15th government working day (if weekend or holiday, the next business day) of each month to the delivery destination which shall be: Department of Veterans Affairs, Service and Distribution Center, First Avenue (1 block north of 22nd Street), Hines, IL 60141. Each month will have a required delivery quantity of 28,669 flags. All deliveries shall be FOB Destination. The place(s) of performance must be clearly specified in the technical quote. Volume II (Price Quote) - Pricing shall be provided in a separate volume with the unit price specified for each flag and the proposed number of flags multiplied by the unit price for flags. Prices proposed shall be FOB Destination to the destination specified above.  The period of performance is 6 months from date of contract award.  8. Award Decision: The government reserves the right to make multiple awards. Award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors. In the instance where the apparent successful offeror's proposal indicates it does not have the capacity to provide the entire flag quantity requested the Government will make multiple awards. Under this circumstance, award would be made based on the quantity the offeror is capable of providing and the next apparent successful offeror will be awarded a contract for the difference. This process will continue until the flag quantity requested is attained. Technical criteria are the offeror's ability and means to furnish the proposed quantity of flags and past performance on previous awards with the Department. 9.

Mini Pleat Filters 24x24x12 Stock Number SFV, Specfications as follows: Superflow-V extended surface area low pressure drop minipleat filters are designed for use in most commercial and industrial HVAC systems where `medium to high efficiency filtration is required. Superflow-V filters are available in average efficiency ranges:  95% and 98% per ASHRAE Standard 52.1 test m ethods and 95% DOP. They may be operated at face velocities from 0 to 750 fpm. Superflow-V filters are UL 900 Class 2 listed. Filters are constructed of multiple minipleat panels each enclosed in a galvanized steel frame. The panels of media are bonded to flame-retardant plastic panels on top and bottom to make an unusually strong assembly that is both corrosion and moisture resistant. Aerodynamic vertical supports minimize air entry turbulence. Filters are totally rigid making them ideal for variable air v olume (VAV) systems, as well as applications downstream of supply fans. Lowest Pressure Drop minipleat filters have an exceptionally low clean pressure drop unmatched by most any filter of the same efficiency. This affords low fan energy costs during much of the life of the filter system. In addition, they are the filters of choice for packaged air conditioning systems that do not have the fan capacity of larger central systems.
