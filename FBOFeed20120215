The new contract will be a five-year contract consisting of the repair and calibration items which are planned to be Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) requirements type contract.  The repair of tactical and non-tactical Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) will have a maximum ceiling for number of repairs.

The Government suggest that small business firms, or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with this procurement, make contact with the firm(s) listed.  This acquisition covers potential future requirements for five (5) years; however, this does not preclude the Government from ordering the maximum quantity at any time during the requirements period.

<RESPDATE>030912
<ARCHDATE>03242012
<CONTACT>Robert Taylor, 202-385-6665

<a href="mailto:robert.c.taylor-ii@faa.gov">robert.c.taylor-ii@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>1.	INTRODUCTION/PURPOSE
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for Architect-Engineering support (A-E) services for the design of a standardized, critical electrical power systems and supporting technical documentation, as well as all training and training related support, critical power distribution system support and technical/engineering support services.  The purpose of this announcement is to conduct a Market Survey to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from interested vendors, in accordance with FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.1.2.1.      
This requirement includes the design only, not build, of electrical power distribution systems for new and existing facilities; the development of power system contract documents; the development of logistics and training documents; the review of construction proposal submittals; and the performance of technical services during construction and installation.  Electrical power system design is comprised of service entrance, standby Engine Generator(s) (EG), Fuel Storage Tank Systems, Uninterruptible Power Supply/Supplies (UPS), switchgear, general purpose panel(s), essential panel, critical panel(s), monitoring software, Static Transfer Switches (STS); Automatic Transfer Switches (ATS) and ancillary equipment associated with the aforementioned equipment.  Replacement or upgrade of electrical power distribution systems in existing operational facilities will require the use of temporary power and extensive planning to ensure the facility remains operational during the transition from old equipment to new electrical distribution equipment.  The FAA envisions making a two-year base award with four two-year options for this effort for a ten year contract if all options were exercised.  However, the FAA reserves the right to determine the contract period that best suits its needs.
The nature of the competition that will be conducted for this procurement has not yet been determined.  The FAA will evaluate the responses to this Market Survey and will make acquisition decisions based on the responses and the FAA's needs.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.  The Principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for this requirement are 541310 and 541330 with Small Business Administration (SBA) size standard of $4.5M in average annual receipts.  
All responses (one per company) are to be provided on company letterhead and limited to a total of 20 typewritten pages.  No type font less than 11 point may be used.  
The purpose of this market survey is to obtain information that is to be used by the FAA in choosing the method and type of procurement competition to be used to fulfill this requirement.  The FAA requires copies of certification letters for interested service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.  In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following information from interested vendors:
2.	CAPABILITY STATEMENT:

<DESC>Contracting Office Address<br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, EPS Suite 600, Room 6072, Rockville, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.<br /><br />Description<br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control &amp; Population Science (DCCPS), plans to procure on a sole source bases with Cancer Care, Inc., 275 Seventh Ave., New York, NY 10001 for the Cancer Survivorship Teleconference to be held July 17, 2012
<p>The services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Part 13.106-1 (b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 624190 and the business size standard in $7.0M.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Performance shall be from May 1, 2012 or date of award, whichever is later through August 3, 2012.</p>
<p>It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this procurement.</p>
<p>As the understanding of the many challenges attendant to the treatment for and recovery from cancer increases, the imperative to communicate this information to survivors, their family members and their healthcare providers has grown in parallel. When treatment ends, people often expect life to return to the way it was before the cancer diagnosis. This rarely occurs. Understanding what to expect after cancer treatment can help survivors and their families plan for follow-up care, identify the &lsquo;normal' course of recovery but also appreciate when a problem may need more attention, make appropriate lifestyle changes, and stay hopeful.</p>
<p>The most significant hurdle is reaching those most in need of this information. While educational groups and booklets are helpful, they may not be readily accessible to large numbers of survivors. In addition, as the long-term and late effects of treatment change over time, staying current with these and techniques to manage them also poses a challenge.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide one (1) custom developed teleconference to communicate and inform all survivors, family and friends what to expect after cancer treatment and provide them with evidence-based information, largely generated from work supported by NCI-funded investigators on best practices or interventions for promoting health and reducing cancer-related morbidity. The teleconference allows the NCI's Office of Cancer Survivorship to improve the quality of life of as well as the length of survival for all those diagnosed with this disease. The teleconference workshop program is available to the public, including anyone who has access to a telephone or computer.</p>
<p>The contractor shall: 1) develop the Survivorship teleconference program content format; 2) develop and disseminate announcement materials to its extensive cancer patient/survivor and oncology professional mailing list (of 21,000 or more) and mailing lists provided by the NCI COR; 3) develop the web platform for and coordinate the online and mailed registration; 4) develop and disseminate an evaluation form; 5) be responsible for all technical aspects of the teleconference set-up and delivery; 6) serve as co-moderator; 7) develop and maintain an online archive of the workshop for public access; 8) provide a summary of the workshop; and 9) provide oncology licensed social workers with master's degree in social work who are trained in addressing the psychosocial aspects of cancer survivorship and referral resources, to service phone lines for callers with questions following the teleconference.</p>
<p>CancerCare, Inc. is the nation's oldest and largest not-for-profit organization dedicated to providing professional support services to people with all types of cancer and their loved ones. Founded in 1944, they offer a full range of services provided by professional oncology social workers to more than 110,831 patients, loved ones, and healthcare professionals per year. CancerCare was an early pioneer in the development and delivery of educational teleconferences, currently serving over 45,000 individuals in the US and abroad. CancerCare has a well-established promotion and outreach strategy for cancer education teleconference participation which includes: an extensive and highly targeted mailing list of over 22,000 names of cancer patients and survivors; healthcare providers and advocates who work with this population; technological infrastructure to support telephonic coordination of over 5,000 national and international call-ins to workshops. Over the past 21 years CancerCare has also developed the necessary expertise (e.g., trained full-time oncology professional staff) and infrastructure (e.g., mailing list, teleconference technology, web cast/podcast capacity) to support and conduct successful teleconferences focused specifically on cancer. Specifically, CancerCare has trained staff of licensed, master's level social workers trained in dealing with the after-effects of cancer, who can address questions from workshop participants and can direct participants to referral resources; a web-based infrastructure for coordinating registration, archiving, and distribution of workshops; and staff and infrastructure to execute and coordinate workshop evaluation.</p>
<p>CancerCare's established reputation for delivering high quality cancer-education teleconference programs, facilitated by oncology social work professionals highly skilled in the management of cancer support services and care, is unique. CancerCare's proficiency is evident in that the organization offers approximately 55 cancer-related educational teleconference programs each year. The organization's extensive mailing list and outreach to cancer survivorship communities, vast technological infrastructure, reputation for excellence in cancer care service, and compassionate trained social workers and other health professionals make CancerCare a unique, and efficient vehicle to disseminate evidence-based cancer survivorship research and information to the public pertinent to NCI's mission. Access to these latter professionals has also been critical to the success of their programs as it means that those who participate in a workshop have available after each call staff knowledgeable about the issues discussed and resources to address these ensuring that all callers can receive assistance. NCI is unaware of any other entity that can provide the professional clinical social work back-up services supplied by Cancer Care. Because education about the late effects of cancer may induce stress in participant listeners, it is critical that this social work backup system is in place for NCI's calls. In summary, to the best of NCI's knowledge there is no organization that can deliver this unique set of technical, clinical, and cancer-community-specific expertise.<br /><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisitions on or before 11:00 AM EST on March 1, 2012. No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax). An original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions at the address stated above. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Ward, Contract Specialist, at wardmr@mail.nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov. No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference solicitation number NCI-120031-MW on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a sole source cost-type Delivery Order under Basic Ordering Agreement N00019-10-G-0004 with Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation (NGSC) on continued risk reduction of the E-2D Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS) integration solution in support of the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye (AHE) Program. A portion of these tasks are to be listed as options to be priced and negotiated during the proposal process for future execution, as funding becomes available. The Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS) is a Global Positioning System (GPS)-base precision approach and landing systems. It is comprised of ship/land systems, aircraft systems and JPALS-specific data link using existing GPS satellites. The JPALS supports joint service (sea and land), civil and multi-national interoperability. The purpose of this procurement is to build on previous NGSC efforts in FY09 and FY10, continuing to define the necessary technical support and required modifications to existing E-2D avionics and providing technical support to reduce risk and refine the technical data necessary for the E-2D JPALS integration effort, currently planned to begin in FY16. NGSC is the sole designer, developer, systems integrator, and manufacturer of the E-2D AHE aircraft and weapon system and, as such, is the only source with the requisite knowledge, experience and data necessary to provide the required supplies and services. In addition, NGSC is the sole Contractor with the data necessary to successfully perform the tasks required to deliver the supplies and services needed to sustain and modify E-2D AHE aircraft and components. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation document exists. See Note 22.<br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The Government does not intend to fund the development or qualification of other sources for fulfilling this requirement, as production for the supplies listed requires a substantial initial investment or an extended period of preparation for manufacture. However, all proposals received within thirty days after the publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />

<p>History: In July 2011, CMS established the DPSP to ensure the protection of CMS data that are disclosed to external organizations for research purposes. The DPSP reflects the agency's priorities to both improve data stewardship and to protect the privacy and security of CMS' research identifiable files (RIF), which are disclosed for relevant research studies. The program is supported through a contract with CMS.</p>
<p>One of the primary objectives of the DPSP is to provide guidance to external organizations on how to implement effective, reasonable, and appropriate measures that protect CMS RIFs. The DPSP leverages the resources of the Research Data Assistance Center (ResDAC), a CMS contractor that provides free assistance to academic, government and other researchers interested in using Medicare and/or Medicaid data for their research. <br /><br />The DPSP consists of monitoring, by remote and/or on-site review, compliance with the privacy and security protections as described in the organization's data management plan (DMP). The DMP is a section of the researcher's protocol that is submitted to CMS, along with a signed data use agreement and contains additional details about the safeguards researchers have in place to protect CMS RIFs. The information provided includes information about the organizations' administrative, physical, and technical safeguards.</p>
<p>The potential contractor will be expected to use the researcher's DMP submission as the basis for its review. It will review the DMP submission and evaluate whether the researcher has explained and documented the privacy policies and procedures it has in place to protect CMS RIFs. Ultimately, the DPSP provides CMS the opportunity to review external organizations' DMPs and make informed decisions on future data requests.

<DESC>Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometer for a Netzsche Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA), Quanity one (1)<br />This announcement is not a Request for Quote (RFQ) and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future. No solicitation is available at this time. The purpose of this synopsis is to identify organizations with the requisite qualifications to provide the services stated herein. Based upon capability statement received in response to this Sources Sought. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Fire Research Division of the Engineering Laboratory have an upcoming requirement to be posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO), the associated NAICS code is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing, the business size standard is 500 This acquisition may be solicited as a 100% small business set aside. All small business organizations (SB SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, and VOSB and SDVOSB) are encouraged to respond to this notice. The specific purpose of this sources sought is to determine if there are any small businesses, within the parameters identified above, that are able to provide the services identified below. It is important to note that in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.219-14 ? Limitations on Subcontracting ? the prime contractor is required to perform at least 50% of the labor with their own employees. ..<br />Background: The development of computer models aimed at predicting fire growth and spread, fire toxicity, and material flammability characteristics requires experimental data (in the condensed and solid phase) in order for these models to accurately predict these behaviors. Increased emphasis on the environmental, health, and safety of products (e.g., potential banning of gas phase fire retardants) is restricting the number of materials available for complying with fire safety requirements; however, we lack the fundamental material property information (condensed and gas phase) necessary to determine suitable EHS compliant alternatives. A Netszch STA F1 Juptier TGA was installed in our lab last year to accelerate the evaluation of new technologies aimed at reducing the flammability of materials. However, this instrument in its current configuration only helps understand the condensed phase behavior. To understand the entire picture gas phase analysis is required, which can only be accomplished with an FTIR attached to this TGA<br />There are no distance restrictions to the NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland campus imposed on this requirement. Interested small business organizations that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this project should submit electronic copies in addition to one (1) hard copy of their capability statement, addressing the criteria identified above. Please limit responses to five (5) pages or less. Any proprietary information should be so marked. Written capability statement should be received by the Contracting Specialist no later than February 24, 2012. References shall include company name, point of contact, telephone number, telefax number, and email address. Duns Number, Capability statement shall identify the business status of the organization.

<DESC>ANNOUNCEMENT NUMBER : NHLBI-CSB-(AR)-2012-075-CRS
<p>POST DATE : February 15, 2012</p>
<p>CLOSING DATE : February 21, 2012</p>
<p>PROPOSED AWARD DATE : March 2, 2012</p>
<p>Title : Maintenance for Gatan Equipment</p>
<p>Project Title or General Description:</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) on behalf of the National Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases Institute (NIAMS), Laboratory of Structural Biology Research (LSBR), is seeking sources to provide maintenance for the Gatan equipment listed below. Since its inception, the LSBR has specialized in detailed structural analysis of macromolecules, macromolecular complexes, and subcellular structures by computer-enhanced election microscopy. The goal of these studies is to elucidate structure-function relationships at the molecular level with particular emphasis on (but not restricted to) systems that bear directly on the mission of NIAMS. This SOURCES SOUGHT (SS) is being issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), NOR IS IT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ). It is not to be construed as a commitment by the requesting party to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this SS. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this SS. This FedBizOpps SS is strictly for market research purposes only. As a result of this SS, the Government may issue a RFQ, however, should such requirements materialize, no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to the SS.</p>
<p>The North American Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 811219 - Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance and the associated small business size standard is $7.0 Million. <br /><br />Based on the responses received from this SOURCES SOUGHT announcement, the NHLBI may conduct a competitive procurement.<br /><br />All eligible companies responding to this SS Announcement must have the capabilities to provide the below services upon receipt of contract.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">STATEMENT OF WORK:</span></p>
<p>The Laboratory of Structural Biology Research (LSBR) has performed ground-breaking studies on cytoskeletal filaments, virus particles and antigens, and complex enzymes among other important biomedical specimens. Cryo-electron microscopy- the technique of visualizing organic specimens suspended in vitreous ice- was introduced in the 1980's and has revolutionized what is achievable. The LSBR has been to the force in these advances and in 1997 accomplished the landmark result of extending the resolution on isolated complexes below the 10A limit for the first time. The results achieved depend both on the quality of the primary data (electron microscope images) and the scope of the computer analysis. As for the former, keeping the LSBR's instruments operational and maintaining them in peak performing condition are essential to LSBR's work.</p>
<p>Specifically, in order to keep the LSBR's electron microscope CCD cameras and imaging filters operational and maintain them in peak performing condition, a maintenance contract that covers repair and routine maintenance is required.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contractor Requirements:<br /><br /></span><strong>Service Provided:<br /></strong>Scheduled Preventative Maintenance: A minimum of one scheduled preventative maintenance visit for each covered instrument shall be provided during the term of the annual contract. During the course of scheduled visits, ordinary repairs and adjustments arising from usage of the equipment shall be made to promote long-term performance and reliability, and to ensure that the instrument is operating within specifications. The contractor shall perform a compliance review of the equipment and shall clean, align and calibrate the equipment, as necessary for the full functioning of the equipment. These visits shall be scheduled for mutually agreed upon dates and times. If both parties do not agree upon dates and times, the Government will designate a date and time.</p>
<p>Unscheduled Maintenance: In addition to scheduled preventative maintenance visits, the Government may place corrective unscheduled maintenance (repair) service calls to the contractor, at no additional cost, in the event of equipment failures requiring immediate repair. The contractor shall respond to unscheduled maintenance calls within one working day of being notified of the need for repair by the Government. The Government shall have priority over service required by non-contract-holding customers for unscheduled field and factory service.</p>
<p>For unscheduled maintenance, the contractor shall provide the following number of minimum site visits, listed below by instrument, each contract year:<br /><br />Gatan Model 794 MultiScan CCD, 2 visits<br />Gatan Model 895 UltraScan 4000 CCD, 3 visits<br />Gatan Model 894 UltraScan 1000 CCD, 3 visits<br />Gatan Model 850 GIF 2002 Imaging Filter, 5 visits</p>
<p>A visit of consecutive days on site will constitute one visit.</p>
<p><strong>Telephone Support:</strong> The contractor shall provide unlimited telephone support for the equipment during NIH working hours (8:00am-5:00pm), excluding federal holidays. Telephone support shall include response to questions about operating practices, applications use and service issues that can be diagnosed and resolved over the telephone.</p>
<p><strong>Replacement Parts:<br /></strong>The contractor shall make reasonable commercial efforts to secure necessary replacement parts and components to perform the service obligations required herein. The contractor shall ship parts within twenty-four hours after identifying the need for a replacement part for the equipment, subject to availability. The contractor shall obtain replacement parts from the original equipment manufacturer in order to maintain the high quality and performance of the instruments. All parts, except consumables, will be replaced free-of-charge.</p>
<p><strong>Software Upgrades:<br /></strong>The contractor will supply free upgrades (revisions) to the original equipment manufacturer software products, core control software, and "plug-ins" required to operate the instruments. If additional hardware or upgrades to existing hardware are required to utilize these software upgrades, the Government will be able to purchase the necessary original equipment manufacturer products through the contractor.</p>
<p><strong>Field Service Engineers:<br /></strong>Fully trained and certified service engineers will conduct all of the service on the instruments. Service engineers must have extensive training on maintaining and repairing these instruments from the original equipment manufacturer and that training must be kept current. A letter from the manufacturer must be provided authorizing service engineers to provide maintenance and to sell replacements parts.</p>
<p><strong>Maintenance Contract and Coverage:<br /></strong>The maintenance contract shall include all labor, travel, living expenses and parts coverage (including system software and/or software upgrades applicable to the Government's current instrumentation configuration). Coverage includes all parts of the equipment except consumables. Service availability is Monday through Friday, during normal Government business hours (8:00 am -5:00 pm), excluding federal holidays.</p>
<p><strong>Requesting Service:<br /></strong>Vendor shall supply a telephone number to their customer service center for use in requesting contractor service or advice regarding equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Compliance with Rules:<br /></strong>The contractor shall comply with all NIH rules and regulations regarding safety and security.

<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) Program Manager Infantry Combat Equipment (PM ICE) is conducting market research to identify sources of technically mature hard armor plates for small arms protection.  PM ICE intends to evaluate operational needs and related constraints against the current state of the art in hard armor designs at 7 lbs/ft2 and below against the specified threats of interest.  The information requested is for hard armor plate designs with a maximum areal density of 7 lbs/ft2.  When designed as a system, where the hard armor is intended to be used in conjunction with a soft armor backing, the maximum system areal density is 8.1 lbs/ft2. The soft armor backing maximum areal density is 1.1 lbs/ft2.
  Lighter weight systems designs are also of interest.  Information desired pertains to designs providing protection against the following threats found in the purchase description Personal Armor X Small Arms Protective Insert (XSAPI) FQ/PD 07-03B, threats D, E, X, and Y.  The hard armor plate may be compatible with currently fielded soft armor systems (i.e. Modular Tactical Vest (MTV), Improved Modular Tactical Vest (IMTV), Scalable Plate Carrier (SPC), Plate Carrier (PC), Outer Tactical Vest (OTV), Improved Outer Tactical Vest (IOTV), and Full Spectrum Battle Equipment (FSBE)) or utilize a soft armor backing not currently fielded by the United States Marine Corps.

PM ICE is performing this market research to develop an understanding of the current spectrum of state of the art performance for hard armor systems at or below 7 lbs/ft2.
  The proposed designs are not required to meet all the performance requirements of the XSAPI purchase description.  The intent of this RFI is to understand technically mature performance capabilities at 7 lbs/ft2 or below against the threats specified.  Proposed technically mature material solutions are requested with performance data obtained from independent laboratories.  If data is not available from independent laboratories, the USMC is requesting any in-house data demonstrating performance capabilities which developers are willing to share.  Additionally, PM ICE is requesting any pricing data available for the hard armor system.  Proposed designs should be Berry Amendment compliant.  Sample submissions are not requested for review by PM ICE at this time.
  All information submitted will be used to determine if this effort should be further pursued.  Therefore, the information provided shall include the necessary detail, data, and complete explanation of the current capabilities and where the technology will be in the near future to enable the Government to make that determination.  The Government reserves the right to ask follow-up questions and engage in discussions with each respondent as part of the market research effort.

Interested parties shall furnish materials concerning their capability to address the above requirements with a technically mature design.  Any proprietary information submitted in response to this RFI will be appropriately protected when clearly identified as proprietary.
  Submitted material will not be returned.  Submissions shall NOT contain any classified information, but may be marked Company Proprietary.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 6.302-2 Unusual and compelling urgency, The United States Department of Commerce, National Ocean Service intends to extend the period of performance for one year for its multiple award Shoreline Mapping Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract with Photo Science, Wool pert, Aero-Metric, Wilson and Co., Nova Digital Systems, and Tuck Mapping Solutions.
<p>The Government will incur financial injury and substantial data loss without extensions of the contracts. This data loss would cause extensive delays in providing the most up to date NOAA Nautical Charts to critical areas of maritime navigation. NOAA can only effectively represent and serve the public in the protection of life and property if these contracts can be extended to receive the data required for its mission. The firms associated with the referenced contracts supply critical shoreline data required to maintain NOAA nautical charts used by commercial and private mariners associated with maritime navigation. This data includes ground survey reports, aerotriangulation reports, digitized point, line, and polygon shapefiles with attribution, chart evaluation files, metadata, and project reports. <br />The IDIQ Contract includes six contractors, the firms associated with the referenced contracts have performed a large portion of the work required to complete and deliver the final products to NOAA. Exceptional time and effort from the firms to become proficient with the unique procedures under the NGS Shoreline Mapping Scope of Work and familiarized with the deliverable review factors would be negated if the use of the cited authority is not granted. <br />Currently there is no other contract available to complete the necessary work. A one year extension will allow continuity of services during the preparation and award of a new contract. The follow-on requirement will be conducted on a competitive basis.</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
1.	IDENTIFICATION OF THE REQUIRING AND CONTRACTING AGENCY:National Park Service - Fort Vancouver National Historic Site

2.	STATUTORY AUTHORITY:Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), and implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.
3.	NATURE AND DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED:This justification seeks approval to award a non-competitive, firm-fixed price contract to Allen Bohnert.  The value of the contract is estimated to be between $12,000 and $15,000, depending on travel and printing costs.
4.	DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEED:The contractor will complete a Collection Storage Plan for the new Northwest Cultural Resources Center based at Fort Vancouver National Historic Site. This multipark facility is expected to curate the collections from eight national parks within the Pacific West Region. The required plan will need to be completed before building design commences later this fiscal  year. 
5.	REQUIREMENT:The contractor must have experience with planning for multipark curation/museum facilities and experience with planning for collections associated with numerous tribes and other federally-recognized indigenous groups as well as the various procedures required by the National Park Service, as well as blending federal, state, and local requirements.
6.	DEMONSTRATION THAT THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITIED:This Collection Storage Plan differs from most for which the National Park Service contracts. There are a number of added complexities, namely working with numerous park superintendents and curators to ascertain museum management needs and costs, and (most importantly) addressing tribal concerns that may affect future operations and storage. The collections in question are together tied to over 30 recognized tribal entities as well as Native Hawaiians and several descendant communities who do not have sovereign status. The collections include items that fall under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, and repatriation status is unresolved. Putting together a plan that satisfactorily addresses the collection storage needs, and the interface between these and public access, in a manner that is respectful to associated nations and communities requires someone who has previous experience with similar scenarios. In addition, it is essential that the contractor have detailed knowledge of relevant federal laws and codes, as well as those policies specifically promulgated by the National Park Service. In our professional opinion Allen Bohnert is the only contractor  who is capable of completing this highly complex and sensitive project; he has the necessary experience and fully understands National Park Service procedures, and the ability to harmonize the requirements of all stakeholders while minimizing cost to the Government.
7.	THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO BE FAIR AND REASONABLE:The cost estimates are based on Collection Storage Plans projects from other parks, though they do not attain the level of complexity this plan is expected to demand.
8.	CONCLUSION:The above information is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief:

Theresa Langford, Curator                                                                                                    16 NOV 2011

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE - Zion National Park, Kolob Terrace, herein announces its intentions to award a sole source contract using the Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR 6.302-2(a)(2) to Interstate Rock.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Only one contract will be awarded.  It is anticipated that a firm fixed price contract will be awarded under $25,000.00.
Reasons for citing authority:
Zion National Park, requires pick up of asphalt in the proximity of Zion National park in order to deliver it to Kolob Terrace Road for maintenance crew to perform road repair.  It is extremely urgent that the material be picked up at a given temperature degree from a reliable company in close proximity to the Park to enable the Roads and Trails Crew to lay the asphalt before it changes composition and temperature.  By acquiring the product from Interstate Rock out of Hurricane, the crew can pick up the product, delivery it to Kolob Terrace, and lay the asphalt in a timely manner to meet the asphalt limitiation requirements.
Interested parties may identify their capability to respond to this requirement for possible future solicitations.  All inquiries must be addressed in writing to Mary Dillon, Contracting Officer to address below.  Responses to this notice must be received no later than February 17, 2012 by 4:00 p.m. MST.  The determination not to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the Government.  This notice may represent the only official notice.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.  Telephone requests or inquiries will not be accepted.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION for SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS OVER $3,000 AND UP TO $100,000 (See FAR 13.106-1)

Date: February 15, 2012 PR Number: R 9512120057

1.  Nature and/or description of the item/service being procured and its intended use (include the anticipated cost):
Replacement of radio service monitor (in poor condition and outdated) used for servicing mountain top repeaters and other two-way radios. Requires small, battery powered, lightweight units for transport on light helicopters and in backpacks.
2.  Sole Source Justification rationale  (Check one and explain below):
__X__Only one responsible source. _____  Urgent and compelling circumstances exist. Include critical delivery or performance dates, and when you became aware of the requirement.  Provide a specific statement of the impact on Government operations, financial or otherwise, if the required delivery or performance dates are not met. ______ Other   _____________________________________________________ 
Explain:
Olympic National Park currently has two Aeroflex 3500 service monitors used for servicing Park radios. Many radio sites are located in difficult to access areas that require helicopter transport or hiking. Weight and size, battery life along with all the required features are key to a monitor that will function in our operation.
3.  Market Research.  Please explain the results or why one was not performed. State whether any other offers were received or anyone expressed interest:
We researched communication analyzer manufacturers: CMS, General Dynamics, Hewlett Packard, Aeroflex and Ramsey.  Aeroflex is the only manufacturer currently producing a lightweight, rugged, and portable unit that supports P25 modulation testing.  The 3500 weighs 8 lbs, has a 5 hour battery life, and can be kept current via firmware flashes.  Includes required scope, spectrum monitor and P25 capabilities.Since we already have two, keeping the same model will be very much more efficient since techs are familiar with the operation. Also keeping current firmware upgrades etc with one model will save money and time.

4.  If this is a determination for sole source, the Contracting Officer certifies:
Only one source is available, or urgent and compelling circumstances exist. The anticipated price will be determined fair and reasonable using the price analysis techniques described in FAR Part 13.106-3(a).

<DESC>The Social Security Administration has a contract with Verizon Business Services (0600-00-40649) for automatic distribution services in support of the SSA national 800 number.&nbsp; This contract would expire 02/20/12. This notice is to advise that SSA intends to negotiate a sole extension to the contract for a period of one year. This will enable SSA to complete the installation of the CARE Through 2020 services. Without this contract extension, SSA&nbsp;cannot perform its mission without the ongoing, uninterrupted provision of these services, nor can it tolerate the disruption to its constituent beneficiaries.&nbsp; The incumbent is in place, operational and able to provide service during the interim period. This is not a formal solicitation. SSA does not require respondents to this notice. Nor will it acknowledge responses.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>The Electronic Proving Ground (EPG) at Fort Huachuca, AZ, has a requirement for Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) test development. EPG's mission is to provide independent verification and evaluation of critical system functions upon which the government will depend for overall evaluation of system performance, safety, and reliability. Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) is a new paradigm in radio frequency (RF) Spectrum Sharing. To test this new mode of radio operation, new testing methodologies must be developed to produce meaningful data. The information developed from that data will provide unique insight into the performance of DSA solutions and support architectural integration, policy development, systems integration, and all other aspects of transferring this technology to the DoD. This project will define the new methods to capture DSA performance data, positive and negative, to determine its effectiveness, risk and limitations of use, and its effect on legacy systems around it.<br><br>CLIN 0001 Dynamic Spectrum Access Test Development (PoP 1 April 2012 - 31 March 2013)<br>Option CLIN 1001 Dynamic Spectrum Access Test Development (PoP 1 April 2013 - 31 March 2014)<br>Option CLIN 2001 Dynamic Spectrum Access Test Development (PoP 1 April 2014 - 31 March 2015)<br><br>Should you have questions or be unable to access the attached SF 1449, please call or email Karen Barrett at 520-538-5898 or karen.l.barrett2.civ@mail.mil<br><br>Please send quotes to: karen.l.barrett2.civ@mail.mil<br><br>The due date/time for quotes is 28 February 2012 at 3:00 p.m. AZ time.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br><br>(i) Technical Capability: The item(s) offered will be evaluated as providing or complying with all the requirements set forth the specification/statement-of-work.  This evaluation will result in a determination of technical acceptability or unacceptability.  Exceeding the technical requirements will not result in a more favorable evaluation since the overall technical evaluation will be Pass/Fail.<br><br>(ii) Price: Offerors are advised to provide the most competitive pricing they can with the initial proposal submission.<br><br>(iii) Past performance:  Offerors must submit three (3) examples of past performance.  The examples shall have been performed within the past three years (3 yr).  Past performance examples will be evaluated for Relevance and Quality.  <br><br>(iv) Delivery: Offeror shall propose shortest lead time possible and meet or exceed the required delivery schedule of 250 cases delivered per month until all 861 cases are delivered in total.

AWARD MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE MADE TO THE FIRM WHO SUBMITS THE LOWEST PRICED PROPOSAL. In the case of equal ratings of past performances, proposed delivery schedule, and technical evaluation, price will be the deciding factor for award.  <br><br>(A)  Relevance is defined as fulfilling the same or similar requirement for the same or similar quantities under the same or similar circumstances.  An example which is considered to be ideally on-point is one which satisfied the same technical requirement for the same quantity, provided to a Government customer, and within the same delivery timeframe as required under this solicitation.  It is not required to submit examples which are ideally on-point; however, offerors should strive to provide those examples which are as relevant as possible. <br>         <br>(B)  Quality is evaluated as overall customer satisfaction, including but not limited to: performance of the equipment and services provided; timeliness of delivery;  willingness to negotiate and accommodate changes;  cost control;  processing of warranty claims;  performance of maintenance agreements;  availability of general customer support.  <br><br>(C)   Three (3) examples of past performance shall be included in the offeror's proposal.  Each example shall have the following information:<br><br>Contract or Sales Number;<br>Date of Sale;<br>Dollar Value of the Contract<br>Equipment and services provided;<br>Customer/Agency Name;<br>Customer Point of Contact (POC) and position within the company/agency;<br>Customer POC telephone number.<br><br>(D)   Should the offeror provide more than three (3) examples of past performance, the Government is not obligated to contact more than the first three.  Offerors should confirm that the POC telephone numbers are accurate and in service; failure to provide valid telephone numbers does not obligate the Government to further pursue those examples of past performance.  <br><br>(E)   In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.<br><br>(F)   Nothing in this solicitation prohibits the Government from obtaining and considering past performance from any source available.<br><br>(G)   Negative information obtained during past performance evaluations will be provided to the offeror to be addressed unless such negative information or circumstances have already been addressed by the offeror.  <br><br>(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The solicitation number for this notice is SP3300-12-Q-5010. This is an unrestricted acquisition for vendors that can provide the required annual maintenance for EMC Storage Area Network servers. The NAICS code is 541519. The size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>This notice incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-55 effective 02 February 2012 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) DPN 20120130 edition and Defense Logistics Acquisition Directive (DLAD) Current to Revision 5 and PROCLTR 2012-21. The complete text of any of the clauses and provisions may be accessed in full text at http://farsite.hill.af.mil.</p>
<p>This procurement is for the purchase of EMC SAN hardware/software maintenance for DLA Distribution Information Operations New Cumberland, PA.</p>
<p>See attached Statement of Work (Attachment 1). The SOW includes a required Bill of Materials.</p>
<p>This is a brand name requirement. Justification to restrict sources is as follows:<br />EMC is the sole manufacturer of the SAN servers which are proprietary in nature. EMC maintains exclusive rights to all products and services. Therefore, maintenance of the brand name servers must be performed by either EMC or an authorized support partner. It is essential that the EMC products utilized to provide for proper maintenance of the systems.</p>
<p>Offerors shall provide the unit price for each component and the total amount, inclusive of shipping costs (FOB Destination). All SAN servers are located at Information Operations at Susquehanna, PA.</p>
<p>Note: The required period of performance for the maintenance is the date of award through October 10, 2012. Prices submitted shall include a reinstatement fee to bring the maintenance current from October 11, 2011 through the date of the award. Estimated date of award is March 12, 2012.</p>
<p>Any award resulting from this solicitation will be issued on a Standard Form (SF) 1449.</p>
<p>The method of payment for supplies under this order is by the Acquisition Operations Office via the Government Purchase Card (VISA).</p>
<p>The following FAR, DFARS, and DLAD clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition. The full text version of these clauses and provisions may be viewed at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offers-Commercial Items. Addenda to 52.212-1; the following paragraphs are hereby deleted from this provision: (e) multiple offers and (h) multiple awards.</p>
<p>NOTE: To receive an award resulting from this solicitation, offerors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database IAW FAR 52.212-1(k) and DFARS 204.1104. Registration may be done on line at: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>DLAD 52.233-9000 AGENCY PROTESTS (SEP 1999)</p>
<p>Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the Contracting Officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity's Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the Contracting Officer; this is not an appellate review of a Contracting Officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the Contracting Officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(End of Provision)</p>
<p>DLAD 52.233-9001 DISPUTES: AGREEMENT TO USE ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) (JUN 2001)</p>
<p>(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute.</p>
<p>(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1, or for the agency, by the Contracting Officer, and approved at a level above the Contracting Officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the Contracting Officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate.</p>
<p>(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here ( ). Alternate wording may be negotiated with the Contracting Officer.<br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p><br />OFFER SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS-Quotes must include the following items. Submission of a quote that does not contain all items requested below may result in elimination from consideration for award.</p>

Failure to include the certifications along with the price proposal or to complete the certifications on the internet may result in elimination from consideration for award.</p>

POC IS MSG SANDRA BERNARD.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

POC IS MSG SANDRA BERNARD.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

<p>All evaluation factors, other than cost or price, when combined are significantly more important than cost or price. However, cost/price may become a critical factor in source selection in the event that two or more offerors are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of all factors other than cost or price. In any event, the Government reserves the right to make an award to that offeror whose response provides the best overall value to the Government.</p>

Please provide a copy of each, the CCR and ORCA registrations.</p>
<p>The Evaluation Criteria shall be applied in assessing quotations. The criteria are listed in descending order of importance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VOLUME 2: TECHNICAL FACTORS:</p>
<p>1. Availability of Quality Controlled Antibodies: (40 Points):</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the offeror's response based upon the availability of the offeror to access the proteins of interest.</p>
<p>2. Technical Approach (30 Points):</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the offeror's response based upon how clearly the offeror's response addresses and describes the offeror's ability to complete/perform the work described in the Statement of Work (SOW) in enough detail that someone with a rudimentary knowledge of the subject would be able to understand the offeror's ability to perform the work.</p>
<p><br />3. Format of Interpretability of Results: (20 Points):</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the offeror's response based upon a clear description of the format of the results, and the assessment of whether those results will convey the resultant protein levels in a clear and unambiguous fashion</p>

<p>The Government will evaluate the offeror's past performance based on information obtained from references provided by the offeror, other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government, and any information supplied by the offeror concerning problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective action taken.</p>
<p>The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.</p>
<p>The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the offeror's performance. The lack of a performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror. The past performance subfactors are listed below in order of relative importance. These subfactors will be used to evaluate the quality of past performance.</p>
<p><br />Past Performance Subfactors:<br />&bull; Record of conforming to specifications and to standards of good workmanship<br />&bull; Adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance<br />&bull; Reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction<br />&bull; Business-like concern for the interest of the customer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Price (Price will be evaluated separately but not scored).</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>(II) This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). Submit written quotes on RFQ Number NRMAG000-12-01976DG</p>
<p>(III) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-30.</p>
<p>(IV) This procurement will be set aside for small business. The associated NAICS code is 611699. The small business size standard is $7 million.</p>
<p>(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial service:<br /><br />Project overview:<br />Two dynamic models of convection will be examined in the context of dynamic data assimilation using FSM - one a simplified convection model that describes the thermohaline circulation in fluids that exhibit buoyancy in the presence of fluids of differing turbulent transport of heat and constituents, and the other a more-realistic model of circulation about the "dryline", a synoptic/mesoscale feature that oft-times accompanies thunderstorm development in the Southwest. The numerical experiments with these models will be executed by two graduate students with background and interest in applied mathematics and dynamic data assimilation applied to meteorology utilizing the Forward Sensitivity Method (FSM). Selected individual will help design the experiments and serve as the expert consultant to students for the programming and mathematical solution to these problems. Significant support for the project will also come from the other principal investigators: Robert Rabin and John Lewis, research meteorologists for the National Severe Storms Laboratory. However, the principal support for FSM will come from the selected individual. <br />Duties follow:<br />1. Experiment Design (developed prior to the arrival to graduate students in June 2012)<br />May 1 - May 31 (2 hours per week for 4 weeks): 8 hours<br />2. Education/Lecturing to the graduate students regarding FSM<br />June 1, 2012 - Sept 1, 2012 (3 hours per week for 10 weeks): 30 hours<br />3. Establish research plan for publication of research<br />August 1 - September 1: 10 hours<br />4. Guidance on the programming and execution of FSM in the context of the two convection models: 30 hours (10 hours per month June 1 - September 1)<br />5. Completion of research following graduate students return to university: 20 hours (September 1 - November 1).</p>
<p>(VI) Proposed individual must be proficient in the Forward Sensitivity Method (FSM) of dynamic data assimilation that is central to this project. The individual must also be able to exhibit innovation with the FSM in the new context of convective dynamics. That is, FSM has yet to be applied to these dynamical constraints and the expert must be able to exhibit original thinking in addition to familiarity with FSM.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is SOL-NC-12-00022, and the solicitation is being issued as a 100% small business set-aside competition Request for Proposal (RFP) using FAR Part 13 Acquisition of Commercial Items Procedures.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-29.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541990, which has a size standard of $7.0 million to qualify as a small business, is applicable.  A firm, fixed-price contract is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.  This procurement is for the development of an int eractive mapping tool that allows a user to identify locations (areas) that are linked via hydrologic networks.   Task One: The Contractor shall develop a geospatially-explicit, modular, transportable, interactive mapping tool.  This tool shall be able to identify service flows to and from an area of interest (AOI) and quantify ecosystem goods and services production or related functions in source areas and demand by beneficiaries in sink areas.  The tool shall integrate spatial modeling tools with publically available data and/or user supplied data, ultimately including literature-based valuation and qualitative interpretation, and shall provide estimates of uncertainty for calculations and outputs. The tool needs to allow a user the option of either using default publically available datasets or load their own data.  The outputs from this tool shall include maps, tables/charts, and reports delineating ?benefitsheds,? quantifying benefit flow paths, estimating economic valu es and reporting of assumptions/values used in generating each map, table or report.  The tool shall be modular in that various types of user-supplied data, maps and information shall be able to be imported into the mapping tool so that users can explore quantifying service flows under differing sets of data (scenarios), assumptions, and timeframes.  The tool shall be transportable in that this proof of concept tool shall be based on the Tampa Bay watershed region, but by using differing maps and datasets the tool may be applied in other areas outside Tampa Bay.  The initial proof of concept mapping tool shall identify ecosystem functions and services flows/pathways in terms of landscape surface hydraulic connectivity including built infrastructure. The tool shall provide the ability to select, trace, and summarize upstream and downstream areas for making estimates of the availability of ecosystem goods and services at a scale appropriate for the AOI.  For example, user choo ses a location of interest (a neighborhood, grid cells, watershed pour-point, etc.) and the tool shall identify all surface water mediated ecosystem goods and service flows, including flows through built infrastructure, of upstream areas (wetlands, agriculture, pasturelands, forests, etc.) capable of producing selected ecosystem goods and services.  Conversely, the tool shall be capable of identifying all surface water mediated ecosystem goods and service flows, including flows through built infrastructure, downstream of user-selected areas (wetlands, agriculture, pasturelands, forests, etc.) where ecosystem goods and services are delivered to beneficiaries (a neighborhood, grid cells, watershed pour-point, etc.).  The Contractor shall develop hydrologic connectivity networks at several scales depending on availability of both surface topography and built drainage infrastructure data.  The Contractor shall obtain publically-available hydrology data at the highest resolution  possible from Water Management Districts, Counties, and/or the City of Tampa Bay, and shall assess data availability from other information sources as necessary to model hydraulic connectivity flow paths through built drainage infrastructure.  First, the tool shall allow users to explore surface flow pathways between any given areas of the Tampa Bay drainage basin at a resolution commensurate with NHD+ basins while also accounting for major drainage infrastructure structures (eg. reservoirs), withdrawals (eg. municipalities, industrial), or discharges (eg. tertiary treatment spray fields).  Secondly, topography at typical national digital elevation models resolution (30 meter) and including major and finer scale drainage infrastructure (eg. canals, major storm water drains) shall be applied to demonstrate flow paths for one or more county level analyses for each county, if available.  Lastly, at the finest scale (neighborhood), high resolution lidar and associated street sca le drainage infrastructure (street scale storm water drains, retention ponds, rain swales and other green infrastructures etc.) shall be used to develop several neighborhood scale demonstrations of water mediated ecosystem goods and services flow paths.  The tool shall be structured to allow flow path analysis at various scales and levels of interactivity.  At a minimum, the user should be able to assess ecosystem goods and service flows to and from an AOI using publically available national datalayers (eg. NLCD, SURSGO, Census) using a desktop -based mapping tool.  The network connectivity would be static for general users, but able to be updated at a higher administrative permission level to reflect future drainage conditions corresponding to future or anticipated landscape development.   This version would allow users to upload different data layers to be assessed with the existing or user provided hydrologic network.  The desktop version will include both the national an d county scale drainage networks as stated above.  The desktop tool will allow the user to select an AOI (eg. an area of urban development, a floodplain) and generate a report summarizing ecosystem goods and services production and delivery through the hydrologic network to and from that AOI.  The desktop tool shall include the ability for a user to also work at finer scales (neighborhood) to modify drainage patterns using new built infrastructure (eg. storm sewers, retention ponds, green storm water infrastructure) and have the tool recalculate the local drainage patterns within a small AOI extent and then link this modified hydrologic connectivity network to the unmodified existing drainage network in the broader landscape.  This local modification would then allow users to assess the ramifications of different local scale drainage management activities to ecosystem goods and service flows upstream or downstream of their AOI.  A user, for example, might want to upload new  landcover/use and associated drainage network dataset, have the tool generate the network connectivity in a localized area and how that network connects to the rest of the unmodified network, and have the tool summarize changes in how much storm water retention is available upstream, or how much pollution removal capacity exists downstream etc.  Optional Subtask: After delivery of the desktop tool, EPA may choose to exercise an optional subtask.  The Contractor shall develop a web-based version possessing rudimentary functionality of the previously developed desktop web-based tool.  The web-based tool shall allow the user to select an AOI (eg. NHD basin) and generate a report summarizing ecosystem goods and services production and delivery through the hydrologic network to and from that AOI. This optional web-based tool would use a static hydrologic network but would allow future scenario analysis by summarizing changes to ecosystem goods and services flows due to user uploa ded scenarios of ecosystem goods and service production on the landscape.  Subtask optional: Web-based tool to visualize flow path analysis at various scales and levels of interactivity.  At a minimum, the user should be able to assess ecosystem goods and service flows to and from an AOI using publically available datalayers.  Applicable and Controlling Documents:  The contractor shall provide a written Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) equivalent to the EPA?s requirement document [EPA Requirements for QA Project Plans (QA/R-50] for the Project Officer?s review and approval 60 days after contract award.  This reference document can be located at:   http://www.epa.gov/quality/qa_docs.html.  The QAPP shall describe in detail all approaches, software, data storage, system requirements, etc. and all standard operating procedures used in the development of the tool.   There is an option for additional work for Tasks 2, 3, and 4.  Task Two:  The Contractor shall develop a tran sportation network module once the geospatially-explicit, modular, transportable, interactive mapping tool hydrologic module in task one has been developed, demonstrated, and accepted.  This module shall provide the ability to map the accessibility of areas where ecosystem goods and services are produced in relation to the proximity of transportation networks.  For example, user chooses a location of interest (a neighborhood, grid cells, watershed pour-point, etc.) and the tool reports the distance-weighted accessibility to areas (recreational spaces, farms, natural areas, etc.), including those assessable by boat, producing selected ecosystem goods and services.  Conversely, the tool shall be capable of reporting the distance-weighted availability of a selected location to all available beneficiaries of goods and services through the transportation network.  The transportation network mapping module shall be fully integrated with the hydrologic mapping tool in task one.  Ta sk Three: The Contractor shall develop an interactive mapping tool module that allows a user to identify line-of-sight views to landscapes (?Viewsheds?) that influence human well-being.  The vista, or visually pleasing view, from any point on the landscape represents value that must be considered among other ecosystem goods and services and shall be fully integrated with both the hydrologic and transportation network modules within the mapping tool.  The tool module shall provide the net viewscape ?value? both to and from each and every location in the study area (vista).  Task Four:  The Contractor shall develop a valuation module using valuation databases or results of available primary valuation studies to derive areal based valuation estimates of the delivery of ecosystem goods and services to and from areas of stakeholder/client interest.  This will allow for visualization of specific services and their values in a user defined or predetermined geographic location and c omparisons of those values between different locations and/or through time. The objective of this work is to determine the impacts of alternative policies, landscape changes, or climate effects on individual or bundled ecosystem goods and services related value over time.  These impacts should be presentable as changes in value associated with changes in the delivery of ecosystem services after accounting for non-linear relationships among ecosystem goods and services supply and demand, and cost benefit ratios related to the value hierarchy of beneficiaries such as willingness-to-pay and other approaches which can also change over time.  The following FAR provisions apply to this solicitation: 52-212-1, Instructions to Offerors?Commercial Items; 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items.  Evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (a) of provision 52.212-2 are as follows: A. TECHNICAL CRITERIA: 1.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Justification for Other Than Full And Open Competition</p>
<p>PR# 21-12-442PCZ184</p>
<p>Pursuant to the requirements of the Test Program for Certain Commercial Items as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13.5 and Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, this justification for other than full and open competition is supported by the following facts and rationale using the format prescribed in FAR 6.302-2.</p>
<p>1. Agency and Contracting Activity: The Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Coast Guard Command, Control and Communications Engineering Center (C3CEN).</p>
<p>2. Nature/description of the action being approved: The U.S. Coast Guard C3CEN Electronics Repair Facility (ERF) in Baltimore MD. has a requirement, to purchase on a sole source basis, for the purchase of a PCS-200 Radar Simulator to be used in support of Centralized Depot repair within the Electronics Repair Facility. Buffalo Computer Graphics is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and will Install, Test and Train personnel on the system integration that is part of the AN/SPS-73 Tech Refresh and Bridgemaster E Radar System. This System will also enable synchronization with established AN/SPS-73 radar systems to increase effectiveness of Depot Repair within the ERF. The Procurement Branch, C3CEN, Portsmouth, VA will award the contract.</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies/Services: A Purchase Request will be issued for the purchase of: one (1) each, PCS-200 Radar Simulator, Part Number 01-210738; one (1) each, Enhanced Graphical User Interface (GUI2) Part Number 51-210937; one (1) Bridgemaster-E Interface option, Part Number 05-410238-3; one (1) Onsite Installation and Training ; manufactured by Buffalo Computer Graphics Incorporated, the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The requested System is to be used exclusively to provide live inputs into the AN/SPS-73 Tech Refresh, and Bridgemaster-E Radar.</p>
<p>4. Identification of the justification and the rationale: This statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) implemented by FAR Subpart 6.302-1, entitled "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".</p>
<p>5. Demonstration that the nature of the acquisition requires use of authority cited: The PCS-200 is the only known graphic simulator found on the market that 1) interfaces with the AN/SPS-73 Radar System and the Bridgemaster E (BME) Radar System, and 2) meets all minimum quality assurance standards set by C3CEN Navigation-Sensors Core Technology Branch, CT-N2. In addition, the PCS-200 Graphics Simulator aids in technical analysis and in support of both the AN/SPS-73 and Bridgemaster E Radar Systems to ensure that both radar systems, sub-system, assemblies, sub-assemblies and associated circuit cards meets the minimum quality assurance standards set by the US Coast Guard. Any variances could adversely impact the ERF's ability to meet USCG minimum safety requirements and ensure mission performance.</p>
<p>6. Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable: In accordance with FAR Subpart 5.2, in an effort to solicit as many potential sources as practical, a RFQ will be posted on FEDBIZOPS, with the statement that any Offerors that feel that they can provide the Exact Items and Services as listed, are encouraged to respond to the RFQ.</p>
<p>7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable: The Contracting Officer will determine fair and reasonableness based on previous acquisitions and Gov/USCG Cost Estimates.</p>
<p>8. Description of Market Research: Market research as prescribed in FAR Part 10 was conducted by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative. The Internet was searched using the technical information required for the use of radar video simulation. The Market Research showed that Buffalo Computer Graphics could meet the minimum Technical Specifications to ensure compatibility with existing Electronic and Mechanical Circuitry and to ensure that safe operational parameters are maintained.</p>
<p><br />9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition: The ERF has invested over $100,000.00 dollars in previously purchased PCS-100 and PCS-200 Radar Simulators. In addition, the Technical Specifications and Supplementary Data are Proprietary to the OEM, Buffalo Computer Graphics, and cannot be provided to other Manufacturers. The alternative would be to change to another system which would not be cost effective.</p>
<p>10. Listing of sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: No sources expressed an interest in this solicitation.</p>
<p>11. Statement of actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisitions for supplies or services required: Recommend no actions be taken at this time to overcome barriers barring full and open competition.</p>
<p>12. Contracting Officer's Certification: I certify that this requirement meets the Government's minimum need and that the supporting data, which forms a basis for this justification, is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>The U. S. Army Contracting Command, Natick Contracting Division in support of Product Manager Force Protection Systems (PdM FPS) has a requirement for Systems Engineering and TechnicalAssistance (SETA) contract to provide personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services. The objective is to provide SETA support to PdM FPS during all phases of pre-acquisition, technology development (TD), engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) production and deployment, and operations and support for Force Protection/Physical Security Equipment (FP/PSE) development/non-development programs and projects to assure the development process is fully integrated with respect to design, test and evaluation, production, operation and logistic support. The primary mission of PdM FPS is research, development, acquisition (RDA), and the commercial product evaluation of FP/PSE under purview of the Army pursuant to DoDI 3224.03. In addition, PdM FPS is responsible for: centralized management of PF/PSE for US Army users, joint service applications, and actions required to type classify such equipment developed by other services or Federal agencies for which a stated U.S. Army requirement exists; and assistance to other Services and Federal Agencies in the development and acquisition of FP/PSE systems. This includes support to the DoD Physical Security Equipment Action Group (PSEAG) and its associated working groups such as the Interagency Technical Support Working Group (TSWG). The following Technology Development (TD), Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and Other Procurement Army (OPA) funded programs/products are currently being managed or supported by PdM FPS to meet DoD specific requirements: Integrated Commercial Intrusion Detection System (ICIDS); Mobile Detection Assessment Response System (MDARS); Battlefield Anti-Intrusion System(BAIS)(AN/PRS-9); Lighting Kit, Motion Detector (LKMD)(AN/GAR-s); Force Protection Suite Project; Entry Control Point (ECP) Project; Non-Intrusive Inspection System (NIIS) Project; Rapid Deployment Integrated Surveillance System (RDISS) Project; Automated Installation Entry (AIE) Project and planning and execution of DoD Force Protection Equipment Demonstrations (FPED).

The Government will award to the Offeror whose proposal offers the best value in terms of Technical Ability, Past Performance, and Price.<br>The Government envisions Firm Fixed Price task orders. The guarantee minimum is anticipated to be $2,500.00 for the length of each task order (base year) and the cumulative total of all Task Orders awarded will not exceed $49,062,064.65 over the life of the contract. The Government envisions that a single award will be made; however, it reserves the right to make no award or to make multiple awards, if in the best interest of the Government. If for any reason, there are no successful proposals, or only one successful proposal, the Government reserves the right to reopen the solicitation. This will be a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business set-aside. NAICS Code 541990, All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services, applies with a small business size standard of $7,000,000. Proposals shall be due no later than 2:00 pm on 2 March 2012.

<DESC>The purpose of Amendment 0001 to Solicitation W25G1V-12-R-0007 is to answer offerors' questions.<br><br>1) Offerors' questions received with Government response:<br><br>Q1) What is the density the end-user is looking for in the foam? The drawings do not specify. <br><br>A1)  The foam density and/or type will be determined by the vendor in order to meet the requirements of MIL-STD-810.  The foam itself doesn't need to meet the MIL-STD, but the density should be chosen so that it protects the stored components from damage in accordance with test the methods described in MIL-STD-810 for shock, vibration, moisture etc.<br><br>Q2) The foam insert does not specify a specific type of polyethylene foam.  Is there a specific rate / class for this application?  <br><br>A2)  See A1.<br><br>Q3) There looks to be a re-enforced section for the insert in the drawing.  Does this part/piece need to be constructed of a rigid foam or can this be a hardened plastic or wood based item? <br><br>A3)  Current transit cases have a hard plastic base as part of -12, Foam, Top.  Base should be made of material of sufficient rigidity to prevent fully populated -12 Foam, Top from deforming when handled.  Approximate weight of stowed items 15 lb.<br><br>Q4) What is the color of the foam used in the transit cases? <br><br>A4)  Foam should be black or gray. <br><br>Q5)  Is there a specific case brand required to be used?<br><br>A5)  The case shall be selected by prospective supplier so as to meet the requirements of the drawing.<br><br>Q6)  Is there a specific density to the foam required?<br><br>A6)  The foam density and/or type will be determined by the vendor in order to comply with the requirements of MIL-STD-810.<br><br>Q7)  Do you wish for the foam insert to be glued into the case?<br><br>A7)  Yes, -11, Foam, Bottom and -13, Foam, Lid must be glued into the case.<br><br>Q8)  Are the case cartons required in the delivery, or can the cases be palatalized and wrapped in plastic?<br>	<br>A8)  Cartons are not a requirement.  Transit cases should be protected from damage in shipment.<br><br>Q9)  What ratio would you like the convoluted foam for the lid?<br>	<br>A9)  See A6.<br><br>Q10)  When is expected first delivery window?  This is important since many vendors will increase prices 1/1/12.<br>	<br>A10)  Within 30 days of contract award.<br><br>Q11)  In regards to Drawing 176658 - dimensions are listed as approximate.  Is it allowable to go shorter on any of the dimensions?  Is a case that is 24" in width, 18" in depth, and 12" in height acceptable?<br><br>A11)  No.  Case dimensions are determined by the configuration of items stored inside.  Refer to overall dimensions of -11 Foam, Bottom, -12 Foam, Top, and -13 Foam, Lid.  Length dimension of each of these three components is 29.6 inches.  <br><br>Q12) The drawing detailing component # 13 (Foam, Lid - please see drawing<br>176658 REV A, page 7) denotes that this component may optionally be manufactured using "Layered Foam". Only component # 13 (Foam, Lid) has notes allowing for fabrication using the "Layered Foam" technique.  Is it correct to assume that all components may be manufactured using the "Layered Foam" technique? <br><br>A12)  Layered construction is acceptable for all three large sections, -11, -12, and -13.  Amount of layers should be kept to a minimum.  All layers must be securely bonded together.<br><br>Q13) The drawing detailing component # 12 (Foam, Top - please see drawing<br>176658 REV A, page 5) indicates that the foam assembly has a 0.25 inch "reinforced base". Please provide a more detailed directive regarding which materials are considered acceptable for the 0.25 inch reinforced base.<br><br>A13)  Current transit cases have a hard plastic base as part of -12, Foam, Top.  Base should be made of material of sufficient rigidity to prevent fully-populated -12 Foam, Top from deforming when removed from transit case.  Approximate weight of stowed items is 15 lb.<br><br>Q14) Would cases that that match the inside dimensions so the inserts would fit, but are smaller than the external dimensions on the print, be acceptable? <br><br>A14)  The inside dimensions are the driving dimensions.  If they are sufficient to fit the specified foam as shown on sheets 4 through 7 of drawing 176658, then a case with smaller external dimensions will be acceptable provided the proposed case has all of the required features - wheels, carry handles, pull handle, etc. as shown on the drawing.<br><br>Q15) What is the required color of the case? <br><br>A15)  Black.<br><br>Q16) Please provide any indication as to the weight rating of the foam (usually, specs in pounds, which refers to the weight required to compress a block of the foam by an inch).<br><br>A16)  The foam density and/or type will be determined by the vendor in order to meet the requirements of MIL-STD-810.<br><br>Q17) Are the foam fabricated products previously supplied manufactured and verified to the +/- tolerance of 0.01 inches (less than 1/64 inch) - the assigned tolerance for the two decimal dimensions noted in the drawing package? <br><br>A17)  Two-decimal-place dimensions have a tolerance of +/- .03.  See tolerance block, area A3, on drawing 176658, sheet 1.  Unless I missed them, I do not see any 3-place dimensions on the drawing which would require a tolerance of +/- .010.<br><br>Q18) Reference Drawing # 176658, sheet 5 of 8 section C1 (B-B) - 12 Foam, Top. The Section B-B portion calls for a .25" Reinforced Base. Is this base material to be polyethylene foam as well? If not, what is the material?<br><br>A18)  Current transit cases have a hard plastic base as part of -12, Foam, Top.  Base should be made of material of sufficient rigidity to prevent fully-populated -12 Foam, Top from deforming when removed from transit case.  Approximate weight of stowed items is 15 lb.<br><br><br>All other terms and conditions remain the same.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

<p>The FBI extensively utilizes HARRIS ACS-163 and ACS-167 T-1 Channel Banks, and HARRIS ACS-SL1 RS-530 Multiplexers in the construction and operation of FBI radio communications systems.

In order to maintain compatibility with the existing FBI LMR network infrastructure, HARRIS multiplexers and application cards must be used to allow the connection of new and upgraded sites to the HARRIS multiplexers used in the existing network facilities.</p>

<DESC>Retrofit National Parks Service Building in Moab, UT with update data cables.<br /><br />The solicitation GS-08P-12-VE-P-0007 was posted to FebBizOps Jan 11, 2012, and per FAR regulation was due to expire 30 days later, Feb 9, 2012.
<p>The solicitation due date was extended to Feb 21, 2012 through an Amendment 0001 processed on Feb 8, 2012.</p>
<p>The solicitation GS-08P-12-VE-P-0007 was inadvertently auto archived by FedBizOps on Feb 10, 2012.</p>
<p>It was discovered Feb 13, 2012, that FBO auto archived the solicitation and it has now been unarchived and is available for viewing.</p>
<p>Regardless that FedBizOps says the solicitation was posted on Feb 13, 2012, the clock started on Jan 11, 2012.  FBO is confused because the solicitation was unarchived Feb 13, 2012, so it thinks that's when the solicitation was posted.</p>
&nbsp;<br />Feb 15, 2012 - Amendment 0002 revises language in the Scope of Work and extends due date of the solicitation from Feb 21, 2012 to Feb 23, 2012. &nbsp;Hour remains unchanged.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br /><br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and man-made disaster situations. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Since 2002, frequent natural disasters and conflict have displaced populations and generated significant humanitarian needs throughout Afghanistan. Recurrent natural disasters in Afghanistan include drought, floods, landslides, earthquakes and avalanches which affect an average of 400,000 Afghans a year. The majority of individuals displaced under the Taliban regime returned home between 2001 and 2007, according to the U.N. However, natural disasters and continued conflict have resulted in recurrent and protracted displacement. An intensification of conflict, particularly in southern regions, forced more than 100,000 individuals to flee their homes in 2010, according to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center. In addition, between 5.5 million and 6 million refugees have returned to Afghanistan since 2002, according to the U.N. In total, approximately 400,000 individuals are known to be displaced as of April 2011, although restricted humanitarian access impedes comprehensive displacement tracking.</p>
<p>Since 2001, USAID/OFDA has provided more than $260 million in humanitarian assistance to address the needs of returning populations, internally displaced persons, and other vulnerable populations affected by conflict and natural disasters in Afghanistan. USAID/OFDA-funded activities have included support for logistics and emergency relief commodities, responses to food insecurity, severe acute malnutrition, emergency health, shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene, as well as assistance to recover basic livelihoods. USAID/OFDA continues to support a three-pronged approach to improving humanitarian responses in Afghanistan by supporting a rapid response capacity to address acute needs following natural disasters and conflict, assisting communities and local civil society to better prepare for and mitigate the risks associated with natural disasters and enhancing humanitarian coordination and data collection and analysis so that disaster affected populations are identified and needs responded to quickly and appropriately.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>USAID/OFDA requires the services of a Senior Humanitarian Advisor based in Kabul, Afghanistan, to ensure that OFDA's objectives for disaster assistance, risk reduction, strategic reporting, interagency coordination, and situational analysis are met in the ongoing response.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>This position requires an individual who is able to reside in Kabul, Afghanistan, as determined in consultation with the Embassy and the Mission and subject to security and programmatic considerations. It also requires a willingness to travel within Afghanistan on short notice for possibly an extended period of time. The incumbent will serve as the primary contact and liaison for OFDA's ongoing humanitarian assistance activities in Afghanistan. The incumbent will work closely with the USAID/Afghanistan Mission, the Embassy's Refugee Coordinator, international organizations (IOs), non governmental organizations (NGOs), the United Nations, and NATO-led forces where appropriate, to respond to humanitarian needs and sudden onset disasters. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will be responsible for program analysis, program monitoring, oversight of program implementation, as well as reporting to OFDA Washington, the Europe, Middle East, and Central Asia (EMCA) Regional Office in Budapest, Hungary, the USAID Afghanistan Mission and, as required, U.S. Embassy staff.</p>
<p>The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will serve as the primary point of contact for OFDA implementing partners working in Afghanistan and will monitor, evaluate and report on OFDA-funded programs. This position requires substantial coordination with representatives from other USAID offices, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA), Provincial Regional Teams (PRTs), District Stabilization Teams (DSTs), as well as with relevant United Nations (U.N.) and NGO agencies, therefore requiring a highly collaborative work style. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly adhere to U.S. Embassy security and travel policies.</p>
<p>Working directly under the guidance and supervision of the Principal Regional Advisor for Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia (EMCA), the incumbent will:</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as the principal point of contact for OFDA in Afghanistan for humanitarian issues, and serve as a liaison on program issues among the USAID Mission, U.S. Embassy, NATO-led coalition forces, OFDA/Washington, and the overall humanitarian community.<br />&bull; Lead efforts to identify and assess humanitarian assistance requirements and target beneficiary groups and locations, and existing relief programs, and recommend the types of interventions and budget levels necessary to support OFDA's programs in Afghanistan. <br />&bull; Supervise relevant foreign national program staff within the Kabul OFDA Program Office.<br />&bull; Monitor ongoing programs and the overall humanitarian assistance landscape in Afghanistan. Regularly review partner's reports, coordinate with OFDA/EMCA regional office, and OFDA/Washington on issues of mutual interest, and provide coordinated Washington and field feedback to the partners.<br />&bull; Coordinate closely with OFDA/EMCA regional office, OFDA/Washington, the USAID Mission, PRTs, DSTs, the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, and NATO Forces as well as U.N. agencies, International Organizations and NGOs working in Afghanistan.<br />&bull; Coordinate collection of information and provide updates and recommendations through written reports on issues related to the humanitarian situation, including the following:<br />o Capacity and level of activity of local institutions to carry out relief programs;<br />o Capacity and ability of U.N., IOs, and NGOs to carry out programs;<br />o Capacity of the logistics infrastructure to support programs;<br />o Security situation of personnel, convoys, and relief operations in general;<br />o Impact of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) activities on humanitarian programs; <br />o Contributions by other donors, problems arising from implementation of relief programs, and any other issues that require the attention of OFDA; and <br />o Humanitarian coordination issues and any recommendations for change.<br />&bull; Provide guidance to organizations that are developing proposals for OFDA, based on OFDA's Guidelines for Unsolicited Proposals and Reporting; review concept papers and proposals and provide timely recommendations/comments to OFDA/ Washington.<br />&bull; Present OFDA perspectives to NGOs, IOs, and U.N. agencies relating to humanitarian assistance strategies, priorities and technical requirements. Work closely with OFDA/Washington Technical Assistance Group (TAG) and PRA to discuss and understand sectoral priorities.<br />&bull; Visit OFDA-funded projects, as security permits, and report on a timely basis to the EMCA regional team on the quality of grantees' work, noting deficiencies, attributes, and evolving operational conditions. <br />&bull; Represent U.S. Government (USG) humanitarian interests at national meetings and conferences, and facilitate, as requested, travel and briefings for official USG visitors interested in humanitarian issues.<br />&bull; Maintain regular liaison with U.N., NGOs, IOs, GIRoA, and other organizations regarding humanitarian activities.<br />&bull; Maintain regular, close coordination and communication with OFDA/Washington EMCA regional offices and OFDA's military liaison officers at CENTCOM. <br />&bull; Contribute to field reports on trends, individual agency programming issues, and topics such as humanitarian protection and coordination.<br />&bull; Submit situation reports and assessment reports whenever necessary, including official reporting cables as the situation warrants.<br />&bull; Have the ability to operate standard field communications equipment; may be required to operate a four-wheel drive, standard shift vehicle in cross-country conditions.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will report directly to the OFDA Principal Regional Advisor (PRA) for the Europe, Middle East, and Central Asia Region in Budapest, Hungary. However, for many activities, the Senior Humanitarian Advisor will coordinate tasks directly with personnel within USAID/Afghanistan, and in collaboration and consultation with other USAID and U.S. embassy staff. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor does not have the authority to commit OFDA resources without approval from OFDA/Washington.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />Supervisory controls will be minimal. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor is expected to act independently with minimal direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment. The OFDA PRA for EMCA will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals and objectives.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11. WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Work is primarily performed in an office setting. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.

<p>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. This sources sought synopsis is for the purposes of conducting market research. The synopsis does not constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, or invitation for bid nor does its issuance in any way restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.</p>

<DESC>The following changes were made:<br><br>(1) The original posting of the synopsis indicated that the Service Contract Act is applicable.  We believe that the services related to this requirement require the use of Professional Employees, therefore, the Service Contract Act would not be applicable.  <br><br>(2) The place of performance has been updated to show the correct location.  The correct location is: <br>Building 1109<br>Fort Lee, Virginia<br><br>(3) We received questions regarding this requirement.  Please see below for answers to those questions.  <br><br>QUESTION 1: I don't see a requirement for a background check or possible security clearance requirement.  You do specify the IA requirement: DFARS 252.239-7001, Information Assurance Contractor Training and Certification but not a general clearance level, please advise.<br><br>ANSWER 1:  The efforts required for this task are expected to be UNCLASSIFIED and should not require the contract personnel to obtain a security clearance.  However, if the tasking performance requires access to classified data, a security clearance of SECRET will be required for all personnel having access to the classified data and a DD Form 254 will be submitted before work commences.<br><br>QUESTION 2:  Does an accounting system have to be approved prior to submitting proposals or at the time of Contract award?  <br><br>ANSWER 2:  Clause 252.242-7006  " Accounting System Administration"  states "The Contractor shall establish and maintain an acceptable accounting system."  An acceptable accounting system is defined in that clause.  This requirement must be satisfied prior to contract award.  We recommend that if your company does not have an accounting system that was determined to be acceptable in accordance with DFARs 242.75 and Clause 252.242-7006, that you attempt to obtain evidence of an acceptable accounting system, as soon as possible.  <br><br><br>QUESTION 3:  Do you plan on providing the final solicitations only to businesses that respond to the synopsis? <br><br>ANSWER 3:  No, the final solicitation will be posted on the Fedbizopps website, to provide the opportunity for all small businesses to propose. <br>

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.  However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Total Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7110-00-NIB-0065	<br />Name:		Office Chair, Managerial Mid-Back Task, Black<br />Description:	Managerial mid-back task chair, seat upholstered in black 100% polyester fabric, back upholstered in black mesh, 360 degree swivel, 2:1 Synchro dual-action tilt mechanism, tilt tension control and tilt lock, adjustable lumbar support of 2.5", height adjustable ratchet back of 2.5", height (3"), width (2.5") and depth (2") adjustable T-Arm rests, black frame and polished aluminum base. Pneumatic seat height adjustment from 18" - 22", adjustable seat depth 2", seat 20" W x 19" D, back 20.5" W x 26.75" H, overall height adjusts from 39" - 42.5". Overall dimensions 21.5" W x 24.25" D x 39" - 42.5" H, black. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		7110-00-NIB-0066<br />Name:		Office Chair, Managerial Mid-Back Task, Black, Leather<br />Description:	Managerial mid-back task chair, seat upholstered in aniline-dyed leather, back upholstered in black mesh, 360 degree swivel, 2:1 Synchro dual-action tilt mechanism, tilt tension control and tilt lock, adjustable lumbar support of 2.5", height adjustable ratchet back of 2.5", height (3"), width (2.5") and depth (2") adjustable T-Arm rests, black frame and polished aluminum base. Pneumatic seat height adjustment from 18" - 22", adjustable seat depth 2", seat 20" W x 19" D, back 20.5" W x 26.75" H, overall height adjusts from 39" - 42.5". Overall dimensions 21.5" W x 24.25" D x 39" - 42.5" H, black. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the General Service Administration, Arlington, VA.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN:		7110-00-NIB-0065	<br />Similar Items:	GWA-Q2S327F; Chromcaraft #X233 197 02 7370; HON-IWM2AHMNT10T; HON-FWCMHMMNT10T; HON-FWC1HPBNT10T; OSP-55403; CHW-9845g2608; GLB-19514; ALE-EL41ME10B; OSP-6216; OSP-2300; LLR-86200; LLR-60540; LLR-85035; HON-MH01MM10C; Buzz Seating ME45K-2G-BK; Sitwell X-45-CT; Sit On It 5623Y; High Mark 2810-E2-A23-GR.A; Ergotech LE10ERGLO; Ergotech FUZ8LX-LO; Ergotech FUZ5B-LO; 9to5 1560; Knoll; Human Scale</p>

<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than February 17, 2012 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>This is to address the issues contractors may have accessing the ASFI site when trying to download the solicitation package.  Please see below instructions on steps to correct this issue. <br>------------------------------------------<br>Website security and trusted certificate authorities have moved to the<br>forefront with the introduction of Internet Explorer 7.0 (IE v7.0/v8.0).<br>ASFI users who have adopted IE v7.0/v8.0 as their standard web browser may<br>have noticed an IE alert stating the ASFI root certificate was not issued by<br>a trusted certificate authority.  This statement is somewhat misleading in<br>that ASFI incorporates the latest DoD root certificates on the ASFI website but<br>IE v7.0/v8.0 does not "recognize" those certificates as trusted since they<br>have not been installed into the web browser by the user.  The instructions<br>below will help resolve this security alert for the ASFI users when<br>accessing the ASFI website. <br><br>(1) Open Internet Explorer and go to the CA Certificate download page.<br>(http://dodpki.c3pki.chamb.disa.mil/rootca.html)<br>(2) Click the link called "Download Root CA 2 Certificate". A popup will<br>appear.<br>(3) Click "Open". The Certificate Window will appear.<br>(4) In the left frame, open the subfolders until you see the "Certificates"<br>folder. The frame on the right will display a list of certificates.<br>(5) Double-click on the "DoD Root CA 2" certificate. You'll probably see two<br>of them, so double-click the first one. A popup will appear.<br>(6) Click the "Install Certificate..." button. The Certificate Import Wizard<br>will open.<br>(7) Select the "Place all certificates in the following store" and click<br>"Browse".<br>(8) Choose "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" and click "Ok".<br>(9) Click "Next" and "Finish".<br>(10) Click the next two "Ok" buttons and close the Certificates window.<br>

<DESC>EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST SOUGHT
The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) seeks two hundred (200) usable parking spaces within approximately one (1) mile of the VA Medical Center (VAMC), located at 950 Campbell Ave, West Haven, CT 06516, for a period of ten (10) years.  The VA seeks to gauge availability of off-campus properties for a potential lease to alleviate the shortage of parking space for VAMC patients and employees.  The VA will consider properties approximately bounded by Main St. (South), Meloy Rd. (West), Allingtown Community Center (North), and Ella Grasso Blvd (East).  
The two hundred (200) parking spaces must be contiguous, paved in accordance with Connecticut DOT requirements, stripped, and of standard width and depth (9'x18').  The parking space must be properly graded and without substantial depressions that result in puddling.  The parking space must be encircled by a chain link fence at least seven (7) feet high.
The parking space must be accessible to the VAMC shuttle bus currently providing transportation between the VAMC and Yale Hospital/University.  The potential lessor must provide a covered shelter for patients waiting for the shuttle bus.
To ensure the safety of patients and employees the parking space must be fully illuminated, with at least one (1) foot of candle overlapping as established by Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA) standards.  The potential lessor must also furnish an emergency call/intercom system for use in situations requiring immediate response.  The power to the system shall be direct wire, with a battery back-up.  The parking space must be equipped with a swing gate and must be secured during nights and weekends.
The potential lessor is responsible for all maintenance and upkeep of the parking space, including snow removal.  The potential lessor must remove accumulated snow and ice during inclement weather to prevent slip and fall injuries.
All Expressions of Interest must be submitted electronically to Colin.Kearney@va.gov, by 3:00 PM EST on February 22, 2012.  Any information received by mail will NOT be considered.   The following information is required for consideration: 
"	Proposed property address.  
"	Name, phone number and email address of Property Owner.  Note, if responding and you are not the property owner (i.e. broker); provide a written statement from property owner authorizing you to represent the owner.
"	Date space is available.
The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to evaluate a parking space most beneficial to the Government.  In making this determination, the Government will consider the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements.  Any questions regarding this notice shall be directed to Colin Kearney, Contract Specialist, at 774-826-3418.  
DISCLAIMER:  This advertisement is not a solicitation for offer, nor is it a request for proposals.  A solicitation for offer may be issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs at a later date.  Respondents are advised that the VA assumes no responsibility to award a lease based upon responses to this advertisement.

Instructions for the
Manufacturer Disclosure Statement for Medical Device Security - MDS2
Version 1.0
Introduction
In light of increased focus on medical device security and the upcoming April 21, 2005 deadline for compliance with the HIPAA Security Rule, the HIMSS Medical Device Security Workgroup has created a standard Manufacturer Disclosure Statement for Medical Device Security (MDS2). The intent of the MDS2 is to supply healthcare providers with important information that can assist them in assessing the vulnerability and risks associated with electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI)  transmitted or maintained by medical devices.  Because security risk assessment is a broad, organization-wide effort, this document focuses on only those elements of the risk assessment process associated with medical devices and systems that maintain or transmit ePHI.  A standardized form allows manufacturers to quickly respond to a potentially large volume of requests from providers for information regarding the security-related features of the medical devices they manufacture.  The standardized form also facilitates the providers' review of the large volume of security-related information supplied by the manufacturers. This form was adapted from portions of the ACCE/ECRI Biomedical Equipment Survey Form, a key tool found in Information Security for Biomedical Technology:  A HIPAA Compliance Guide (ACCE/ECRI, 2004).  HIMSS recommends that the information in the MDS2 be used to help complete the ACCE/ECRI form and associated processes as part of each organization's HIPAA Security compliance efforts.
The manufacturer-completed MDS2 should: 
(1)	Be useful to healthcare provider organizations worldwide.  
While the form does supply information important to providers who must comply with the HIPAA Security Rule, the information presented is intended to be useful for any healthcare provider who aspires to have an effective information security and risk management program.  Outside the US, providers would therefore find the MDS2 an effective tool in addressing such regional regulations as EC 95/46, HPB 517, and PIPEDA. 
(2)	Include device-specific information addressing the technical security-related attributes of the individual device model.
This completed MDS2 form provides a simple, flexible way of collecting the technical, device-specific elements of the total information needed by provider organizations (device users/operators) in preparing for their first round of medical device risk assessments.  Providers around the world should find a completed MDS2 form useful in controlling information security (i.e., confidentiality, integrity, and availability) risks. Note, however, that the MDS2 is not intended and should not be used as a basis for medical device procurement.  Writing procurement specifications requires a deeper and more extensive knowledge of security and the provider's mission.
Using the information provided by the manufacturer in the MDS2 combined with information collected about the care delivery environment (e.g., through tools like ACCE / ECRI's guide for Information Security for Biomedical Technology), the provider's multidisciplinary risk assessment team can review assembled information and make informed decisions on implementing a local security management plan.
The Role of Healthcare Providers and Medical Device Manufacturers in the Security Management Process
Responsibility for effective security management must ultimately lie with the provider organization.  Generally the device manufacturers can assist providers in their security management programs by offering information associated with 
"	the type of data maintained / transmitted by the manufacturer's device or system
"	how data is maintained / transmitted by the manufacturer's device or system
"	any security-related features incorporated in the manufacturer's device or system
In order to effectively manage medical information security and comply with relevant regulations, healthcare providers must employ administrative, physical and technical safeguards, most of which (other than some technical safeguards) must be adopted and employed on-site extrinsic to the actual device.  Other than some general recommendations with regard to medical devices:
"	there are few ADMINISTRATIVE safeguards manufacturers can address beyond providing assistance in security training
"	there are few PHYSICAL safeguards manufacturers can address beyond incorporating physical security features (e.g., component lock & key, theft/intrusion alarms) in their devices
The greatest impact manufacturers can have on medical device security is to incorporate TECHNICAL Safeguards (i.e., security features) in their devices to facilitate the providers efforts in maintaining an effective security program and meeting any relevant regulations.   The medical device manufacturing industry is increasingly aware of the importance of having effective security features in their devices and systems.  Manufacturers are generally including such features in the production of new devices and systems based provider needs and requirements.
Instructions for Obtaining and Using the MDS2
Information provided on the MDS2 is intended to assist professionals knowledgeable in security and risk assessment processes in their management of medical device security issues.  The information on the MDS2 is not intended and may be inappropriate for any other purpose.
Completed MDS2 forms for many devices and systems may be available directly from the device manufacturer.   Check the manufacturer's web site first for relevant forms and, when not available there, contact a manufacturer's representative to request a MDS2 for the appropriate device(s)/system(s).  If a manufacturer does not have a completed MDS2 for the appropriate device(s)/system(s), enter the device category,  manufacturer and model information in the appropriate boxes on the top of a blank form  and submit the form(s) and these instructions to the manufacturer's compliance office for their completion. 
Note that HIMSS suggests that a standard naming convention be used for the device category terms and manufacturer names listed on the form.  This assists providers in matching information from the form to their equipment inventories.  ECRI's Universal Medical Device Nomenclature System (UMDNS) is the most widely used.  Adopted by thousands of healthcare providers worldwide, UMDNS has been adopted by the National Library of Medicine into its Universal Medical Language System, and has been recommended by the Institute of Medicine for inclusion in the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS) core terminology group.  For more information about UMDNS contact ECRI at www.ecri.org.
Side 1 of the MDS2 contains descriptive information on the type of data maintained/transmitted by device, how the data is maintained/transmitted, and any security-related features incorporated in the device.  Side 2 contains manufacturer-optional recommended security practices and space for numbered explanatory notes that may expand on answers to questions 1 through 19.  Manufacturers may elect to attach supplementary material if additional space for recommended practices or explanatory notes is necessary.
Question-specific notes.
1.	Maintaining ePHI includes storage on an internal disk, removable media, short-term computer memory, etc.
Transmitting ePHI includes receiving/sending external to the device via network, telephone, direct connect cable, removable media, etc.
2.	The four sections of this question relate directly to the 18 data elements referred to in HIPAA, any of which, if present, render the entire electronically transmitted/maintained data set as ePHI.  The 18 data elements included in the Rule are: 
"	Name
"	Geographic data (e.g., address)
"	Dates (e.g., date of birth, admission, discharge, death, treatment)
"	Telephone No.
"	Fax No.
"	E-mail address
"	Social Security No.
"	Medical record No.
"	Health plan beneficiary No.	"	Account No.
"	Certificate/license numbers
"	Vehicle identifiers
"	Device identifiers
"	Universal Resource Locators (URLs)
"	IP address numbers
"	Biometric identifiers
"	Full face (or comparable) photographic images 
"	Any unique identifying number, characteristic, or code
The open, unstructured text question (2d) is intended to indicate an additional element where a provider might put further identifying information.
3.	Here the manufacturer provides more detail on how ePHI is maintained.  Note that a fully networked device is likely to have all three items with a 'Yes' response.
"	Persistently on local media refers to media created or directly attached to the device under consideration (e.g., MR Scanner, 3-D workstation), not a remote archive. 
"	Import/export ePHI refers to data that is sourced or destined to remote storage devices (e.g., an MR scanner that relies on an image server in a PACS system).
4.	Import and export refer to movement of information via published open protocols to devices outside of the medical device under consideration (e.g., medical information bus (IEEE 1073), serial port, and published protocol that allows general access to ePHI).  Dedicated cable here refers to communication via a point to point cable to a device or system outside of the device under consideration.
5.	This question includes either explicit security training or explicit sections of administrator or user manuals that detail the device security features and their use.
6.	This question identifies the underlying 3rd party system software platform (operating system) name or indicates if there is no 3rd party platform (i.e., proprietary system created for this manufacturer alone).
7.	Refers to the typical installation of the manufacturer's device.
8.	Refers to an integrated feature that supports information backup onto removable media (e.g., optical disk, magnetic disk, tape).
9.	Identifies whether it is possible to start the device with software from any source other than the manufacturer's normal startup device (e.g., an integral hard disk or ROM).
10.	Does the device allow, through root access, administrative privilege, or other non-intrusive method, a local user and/or IT staff to install software not provided and not explicitly authorized by the manufacturer (e.g., email client, office applications, virus scanner, browsers, games)?
11.	Remote service refers to device maintenance activities performed by a service person via network or other remote connection.
12.	Level of owner/operator access to device operating system.  Here the manufacturer details what is technically possible if the device owner (generally the healthcare provider) has the technical ability to install security controls on the medical device under consideration. A MANUFACTURER ANSWERING 'YES' TO ANY OF THESE QUESTIONS DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE MANUFACTURER AUTHORIZES THE OWNER TO PERFORM THESE FUNCTIONS. THE OWNER ASSUMES ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED INSTALLATION or REPAIRS. UNAUTHORIZED INSTALLATION or REPAIRS MAY VOID APPLICABLE WARRANTIES AND SERVICE AGREEMENTS. Authorization to perform these security-related services or changes to a medical device should be obtained in writing from the device manufacturer. Unauthorized changes to a medical device may remove it from government regulatory controls (e.g., FDA) and render the device an experimental medical device.
13.	Self-explanatory.
14.	Self-explanatory.
15.	Clarifications:
"	Controlled viewing refers to operations that have to do with the display, printing, or other use of ePHI (e.g., image display, record print-out).
"	Creation, modification, or deletion would mean that all these events are tracked in the log file.
"	Export or transmittal refers to the movement of ePHI outside of the device under consideration.
16.	Emergency access features allow operators emergency access to the device in cases where the normal authentication cannot be successfully completed or is not working properly. 
17.	Self-explanatory.
18.	Clarifications:
"	Physically secure connection is a cabling system that is not accessible to the general public. (i.e., it is in a physically controlled space such as examining rooms, communication closets, or building plenum).
"	Fixed list is an explicit mechanism that limits the connections and nature of connections on a per-device basis.
19.	Ensure integrity refers to methods that can detect and/or correct differences between the source makeup of an ePHI message and the ePHI message received by an external device. Is such a method available for use as part of the device under consideration (either in transmission or receipt of ePHI)?

Introduction: The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA), Office of Acquisition and Operations (OAO), Strategic Acquisitions Center (SAC), Fredericksburg VA is issuing a Sources Sought Notice/Request for Information for Service Dog Insurance. THIS IS NOT AN ORDER, SOLICITATION, OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. This announcement is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation for services. Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be made as a result of this announcement. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized and posted at www.fbo.gov. 

Your response to this Sources Sought announcement will assist the VA in determining the best acquisition solution to ensure robust competition, and ultimately the best valued solution for the VA Service Animal Health Insurance requirement. This announcement is specifically targeted for interested, qualified businesses that can provide animal health insurance across the Continental United States (CONUS), Alaska, Hawaii, U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Guam and potentially the Philippines. 

Background: Service/guide dogs are considered a prosthetic device in the VA system. They serve as a critical component of rehabilitation and can be part of the treatment plans for Disabled Veterans. Veterans that acquire service and guide dogs for significant visual, hearing, and mobility impairments may apply for and be awarded VHA veterinary benefits under current regulations. Just as we would maintain or repair another prosthetic device, we provide payment for veterinary care for service/guide dogs. We are seeking a vehicle such as pet insurance to control costs and maintain consistency. 

Objectives: 
Award Service Animal Health Insurance contract vehicle(s) to provide comprehensive commercial medical insurance coverage for service dogs of eligible veterans. Currently, there are approximately 600 dogs that are part of this program. This number is likely to increase. 

The animal medical insurance provider shall accept "all comers". Thereby, all dogs will be covered under the policy regardless of breed, age, and the hereditary conditions associated with them.  Please note, due to the investment of time and money into the extensive training of service dogs, dogs that enter a service dog program are examined, tested and screened by a Veterinarian prior to the training program.  Once in training, the dogs are followed at regular intervals to ensure the best health when placed with a Veteran handler.  Dogs of this caliber should be considered very healthy and negative for a hereditary condition.

The insurance will ensure that the VA, not the veteran, be billed for any premiums, copayments, or deductibles associated with the policy. 

The policy will feature dental coverage (sedated teeth cleaning when necessary) for all service dogs. 

The policy will cover both well dog and emergency care for all service dogs.

Well Dog coverage will include: 
--Yearly check-up/physical 
--Dental coverage, i.e., teeth cleaning (with sedation when deemed necessary) 
--Immunizations 

Emergency Care will include coverage for: 
--All pre-existing conditions such as hip dysplasia, 
--Diagnostic tests, surgeries, prescription medications, (including hereditary and congenital disorders) 
--Euthanasia and cremation services 

For additional information on the requirement, please see the Federal Register posting at: https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2011/06/16/2011-14933/service-dogs

Questions:

What is the feasibility of providing medical insurance coverage to all dogs, regardless of breed, age, and hereditary conditions? Is there an established age range for working dogs? 

Would it be more efficient and effective to provide insurance on a regional basis? Market research has indicated animal insurance prices are relative to geographic location. What is the geographic range your company can cover? What are limitations of an insurance company providing coverage overseas? 

In responding to this announcement please include the following: 
Name of Company 
Contact Information 
Business Size: Please indicate your business size (Large or Small). If you happen to be a small business, please indicate your size standard and small business socio-economic sub-categories that represent your business; are you a Service Disable Veteran Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone, Woman-Owned? Indicate any sub-categories that apply. 

Interested parties may respond to this notice via e-mail to 
jesse.hardy@va.gov 
and 
regina.mcgregor@va.gov. 

The response date is extended to February 23, 2012.

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	 Contracting Activity:  The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Contracting Office Amarillo Network Contracting Activity 18, located at 6010 Amarillo Blvd West, Amarillo TX 79106 proposes to enter into a firm-fixed price contract on the basis of justification for other than full and open competition for the VA Amarillo Healthcare System. The Purchase order number is VA504-A20005. 

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  This is a new procurement and the contract contemplated will be firm fixed price to NeoMend, at 60 Technology Drive, Irvine, CA 92618. 
3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agencys Needs: The requirement is to provide the Amarillo VAMC Surgical SVC Thoracic Surgery with ProGel to use to prevent and seal any intra-operative air leaks. This sealant will reduce the average length of stay by 2 days-thus reducing hospital costs and post-op occurrences. Air leaks are the number one complication associated with pulmonary surgery and often lead to other complications (pneumonia, empyema, pneumo thorax, and infection). The contractor is required to deliver the item within one week of contract award on emergent basis.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  41 USC 253(c) (2), as implemented by FAR 6.302.2  

	(  )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(X)  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractors Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  An unusual and compelling urgent requirement for the NeoMend ProGel is needed.  NEOMEND is the only manufacturer of such Pleural Air Sealants and the ProGel is the only FDA approved sealant for lung air leaks.  This sealant will reduce the average length of stay by 2 days-thus reducing hospital costs and post-op occurrences.  Air leaks are the number one complication associated with pulmonary surgery and often lead to other complications (pneumonia, empyema, pneumo thorax, and infection).  Surgical Service Thoracic Surgery has used Pro Gel in the past at this facility with good clinical outcomes.  With the changes in contracting, this product must now be procured through contracting.  Because there are veterans who are currently at risk of post operative occurrences the ProGel is required and the contractor can meet the required delivery of one week from contract award, failure to provide the needed item would not meet the VA mission of providing exceptional healthcare treatment to veterans.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  FedBizOpps Posting:  The requirement will not be synopsized in accordance with 5.202(a)(2), in that this acquisition is being conducted under unusual and compelling urgency and the Government would be seriously injured if the agency complies with the time periods specified in 5.203.  

Efforts to Solicit Other Potential Sources:  Market research was not conducted because this is the only FDA approved product for lung air leaks. The requirement cannot be competed because it is the only product that is FDA approved for lung air leaks.

Future Acquisition Strategy & Efforts:  A one year fixed-price contract with NeoMend for the ProGel will be used to meet the unusual and compelling urgency of the Amarillo VAMC.  The one year contract will allow the VA Amarillo Network Contracting Agency enough time to solicit the requirement for a new contract which will be for a 1 (one) year supply of the approved ProGel.  

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The anticipated dollar value for the contract action is for $3444.52.  The NeoMend ProGel has been determined to be commercial in accordance with FAR 2.101; cost or pricing data will not be required.  Pricing techniques as are described in FAR 15.404-1(b)(2), will be used to establish price fairness and reasonableness.  The Contracting Officer determines that the anticipated price will be fair and reasonable based on historical price analysis.  Market research and analysis was not conducted because this is the only FDA approved product for lung air leaks. The requirement cannot be competed because it is the only product that is FDA approved for lung air leaks. 

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Market research was not conducted because this is the only FDA approved product for lung air leaks. The requirement cannot be competed because it is the only product that is FDA approved for lung air leaks.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  Delay in award would result in both a significant amount of thoracic surgeries being delayed and, in emergency situations significantly increase the probability by 50% for post operative occurrences of pneumonia, empyema, pneumo thorax, and infection. Post operative occurrences are costly to the Government.  

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  See Section VI above.

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  The proposed contract is a onetime one case emergent purchase,  which allows the VA Amarillo  Network Contracting Activity enough time to compete the requirement.  There is a plan to re-contract for the NeoMend ProGel for 1 (one) year.  The requirement has been identified and the acquisition planning will commence following the award of this contract.  A presolicititaion synopsis will be posted in accordance with FAR 5.201 for the new need.  


12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
