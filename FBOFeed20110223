<DESC>TITLE: FA4809-11-Q-0030, Sole Source Acquisition for the purchase of an Anti-Gravity Treadmill<br /><br />The 4th Contracting Squadron, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC intends to award a sole source purchase for an Anti-Gravity Treadmill from Alter-G Inc.
<p>The Salient Characteristics are as follows:<br />1. The item requested is an Anti-Gravity Treadmill. The treadmill must have the capability to help patients who are not able to support their full body weight and would benefit from exercising on the Anti-Gravity Treadmill.<br />2. The Treadmill must be an unweighting. <br />3. The Treadmill must be 220 v.<br />4. The Treadmill must be no higher than 74", the width must be no more than 38" and the length no longer than 84". The maximum weight to hold patients must be 400lbs.<br />5. The Anti-Gravity Treadmill must use air pressure to unweight the patient. <br />6. The ceiling height in the Physical Therapy is at a minimum 96".<br />7. The Anti-Gravity Treadmill must be used for rehabilitation allowing patients to become mobile and weight bearing as soon as possible. The Anti-Gravity Treadmill must be used to help maintain cardiovascular condition, when painful joints prevent running on hard surfaces. <br />8. The Anti-Gravity Treadmill must provide precise unweighting in one percent increments to as low as 20 percent of the patient's body weight. The speed range must be 0-12 mph, adjustable at 0.1 mph and 0-15 percent incline.<br /><br />This purchase will be made under Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition as authorized by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract lies solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement. The closing date for this synopsis is 7 March 11 at 10:00 A.M. Eastern Standard Time. The anticipated award date is 18 March 11. For information regarding this purchase, please contact TSgt Patrick Hall at (919) 722-5405.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY: Request to award this requirement to only one responsible source due to the anti-gravity treadmill in paragraph 2 being manufactured and sold by AlterG Headquarters only. AlterG has the anti-gravity patent for the M320. The U.S. patent number is 7,591,795 and AlterG does not have any authorized resellers. Additionally, there are no other "anti-gravity" systems available on the market. The other treadmills use suspension harness that causes too much stress on the upper body. The AlterG helps with the care of patients after surgery because you can adjust the amount of weight bearing capacity up to 80% of body mass being weight free. The AlterG treadmill provides precise early partial weight-bearing following injury or surgery to restore natural gait, range of motion and improves patient outcomes. The treadmill aids in prosthetic training with improved balance and allows neuromuscular re-training. The anti-gravity treadmill will improve physical therapy results and speed recovery time for active duty personnel while they recuperate allowing personnel to get back to everyday activities faster, without spending more time to get back into shape after months of therapy.</p>

<a href="mailto:lisa.m.digney@us.army.mil">Rock Island Contracting Center (RI-CC)</a>
<DESC>The Office of the Project Manager for Non-Stockpile Chemical Material (PM NSCM) has the mission responsibility, as mandated by Public Law 102-484, for the disposal of all applicable chemical warfare materiel (CWM) in a safe and environmentally acceptable manner.  To accomplish this mission, NSCM has developed various mobile treatment systems capable of deploying to various geographic locations for disposing of CWM items.  These deployments generate waste that must be managed in accordance with (IAW) local, state, Federal, and in some instances international treaty requirements.  In support of this, the long-range (Fiscal Years 2012-2016) projected secondary and neutralent wastes produced from various NSCM projects are estimated to include, but are not limited to, the following: closure of the Pine Bluff Ton Container Decontamination Facility (PBTCDF); two generic Explosive Destruction System (EDS) deployments per year, locations to be determined; two generic Single CAIS Assessment and Neutralization System (SCANS) deployments per year, locations to be determined; and establishment and operation of a field office at Redstone Arsenal (RSA), Alabama.<BR><BR>To obtain this waste management support (WMS), solicitation W52P1J-11-R-0051 will be issued to establish and/or maintain partnership(s), as needed, with commercial Treatment, Storage, & Disposal Facilities (TSDF) for transporting, handling, and disposing of the various Non-Stockpile waste streams, with the capabilities of waste disposal by 1) using an existing non-incineration based technology, or 2) using incineration based technology.  The establishment of the TSDFs partnership(s) will involve significant interface between the prospective TSDFs, the contractor, and the Government for the screening and selection of the successfully chosen TSDFs.  As contained in the solicitation, the selection process will be documented and provided to the Government for its review and approval.  The TSDF selection process will be based on market surveys and may include, but not be limited to, the following factors: current technical, operational, and management capabilities (including Quality Assurance/Quality Control), current permitting status/record keeping and retention, previous and current environmental compliance, financial stability, willingness to accept and process NSCM waste streams, and/or community and state public affair and outreach involvement.  Each of the selected TSDFs will undergo an operational readiness evaluation conducted by the contractor and witnessed by the Government with each of the established TSDFs being subject to follow-up periodic re-evaluation(s) of its status.  In addition to the partnership efforts, the contractor will be required to prepare life cycle cost and schedule planning, to identify risk areas and data gaps, and to establish one or more subcontracts for transportation, waste sampling and analysis, and/or waste disposal services.<BR><BR>The above solicitation will be issued as an unrestricted full and open competitive, best value request for proposal (RFP) that will result in a single source indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract type award, IAW FAR 16.5/DFARS 216.5, with a five-year ordering period covering the NSCM programmatic WMS for Fiscal Years (FY) 2012-2016.  The RFP will contain the basic contract terms, an umbrella statement of work (SOW), and a master deliverable list along with the first twelve-month period of performance (POP) SOW.  Once evaluated and a successful awardee selected, the basic IDIQ contract and task order 0001 will be awarded at the same time; the award of task order 0001 will satisfy the Government's minimum ordering liability, as contained in the basic contract.  Due to the nature of the services and the uncertainty of the NSCM waste streams and project deployments/schedules, the anticipated basic contract type will be setup for awarding cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) task orders.  When awarded, the NSCM WMS will primarily be funded with applicable Operations & Maintenance (O&M) funding, subject to availability.  There may be a limited number of special projects/task orders that may be funded with Research & Development (R&D) or Procurement (PROC) funding, as determined on a task-by-task basis.  The ordering period is for 5 years, with an option to extend up to 5 more years under the authority of DFARS 217.204(e)(i).  The individual POPs, SOWs, and their corresponding task orders within this ordering period will be negotiated with the contractor, as the projected NSCM waste streams and projects are better defined and estimated; these negotiations will primarily be one-year POPs.  <BR><BR>The noted RFP is anticipated to be issued, via the Government-wide Point of Entry (GPE), on or after 28 Mar 2011; no further notice will be provided by the Government on its issuance.  As such, interested parties are responsible for obtaining the noted RFP issued via the GPE.  The anticipated proposal preparation period for this solicitation will be ninety (90) days from the solicitation issuance date.  All comments and/or questions regarding the solicitation shall be submitted within thirty (30) days from the solicitation issuance date, as delineated in the solicitation.  The Government will provide answers to any industry's comments and/or questions and/or amendments to the solicitation via the same electronic means.<BR><BR>The Government intends to make one award for the requirements outlined in the solicitation.  The Government will determine which offeror can best accomplish the requirements set forth in this solicitation.  In making this determination, the Government will conduct an integrated assessment to determine the best value to the Government using the criteria outlined in this document.  Award will be made to the offeror, whose proposal represents the best value to the Government, considering the evaluation criteria and the requirements of the solicitation.  Consequently, integration of the technical/management area, the performance risk assessment, and small business utilization evaluation with the total evaluated price could result in award to an offeror other than that with the lowest price/estimated cost; however, the Government reserves the right to make no award as a result of the solicitation if, upon evaluation, none of the proposals are deemed likely to meet the technical/management requirements at an acceptable level of risk and/or cost.  Award is projected on or before 1 Mar 2012.<BR><BR>The Government will solicit and evaluate proposals in accordance with the procedures in Section L, Instructions for Offerors, and Section M, Basis of Award, of the solicitation.  Offerors will respond to the solicitation with a stand-alone proposal, including four volumes: (1) technical/management, (2) past performance, (3) cost/price information, and (4) small business utilization.<BR><BR>A pre-proposal conference is anticipated to be held at the Pine Bluff Arsenal (PBA), AR, approximately twenty (20) days after issuance of the solicitation.  In addition, a tour of the PBTCDF site will be conducted.  Controlled entry into PBA will be required for the tour.  Full details for the pre-proposal conference will be contained in the solicitation.<BR><BR>The point of contact for this solicitation is Mrs. Lisa Digney, Army Contracting Command - Rock Island, Chemical Demilitarization Division, Rock Island, IL.

<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command, and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) in relation to the provision of CIS support for the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. <br /><br />NC3A released an initial Notice of Intent to Invite Bids (NOI) for this project in May 2009. The IFB, however, was not released to industry, due to unexpected design and security integration issues. The requirements for this project have since been reassessed and revalidated.
<p>The reference for the reissued IFB is IFB-CO-12735-OPL, and all correspondence concerning this IFB should reference this number. All nominations from the previous NOI issued in 2009 have been included in the preliminary bidders list.</p>
<p>The estimated cost for the services and deliverables included within the basic scope of the intended contract is &euro;1,700,091.</p>
<p>NC3A has been authorized to use the Alliance Operations and Mission (AOM) International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedure. The contract shall be awarded on a lowest price, technically compliant basis.</p>
<p>NC3A plans to place a single contract for the entire scope of work. No partial bidding shall be allowed.</p>
<p>The technical specifications applicable to the bidding and the contractual documents are NATO UNCLASSIFIED. For the performance of the contract, however, contractor personnel will be required to hold a NATO SECRET security clearance. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to NC3A the NATO clearance certifications for all personnel assigned to the contract.</p>
<p>SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The project provides Liaison Office Deployable kits (LNO packs) that will enable LNOs to tie into the main ISAF and NATO networks as required. Each LNO pack will support users connecting to static networks over commercial Inmarsat links.</p>
<p>ISAF personnel will be regularly deployed on liaison tasks, requiring the capability to have secure voice and data connectivity up to ISAF SECRET to static locations. To achieve this, 11 LNO packs are required and shall be self-contained, compact, portable units that will provide deployable secure communications services to support up to eight users. Each transportable pack shall be self-contained in transit cases to include voice and data terminals along with the associated network infrastructure. Each pack shall also include its own power generation capability.</p>
<p>The LNO packs will need to be fully configured, tested, and documented prior to fielding in ISAF. Furthermore, the necessary training must be provided.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The contractor shall be responsible for the design and delivery of 11 deployable kits including power generation capability. Three cryptographic equipment and Inmarsat terminals will be provided as Purchaser Furnished Equipment (PFE), which the contractor will integrate into its solution.</p>
<p>The contractor will be responsible for building, integrating, pre-configuring, and documenting all the deployable kits to be ready for use on the NATO network with support from NC3A and NATO CIS Support Agency (NCSA) staff.</p>
<p>The contractor shall be responsible for generating all security accreditation documentation in relation to the designing of the deployable kit solution, with support from NC3A and NCSA staff.</p>
<p>The contractor shall be responsible for providing complete training both the use and maintenance of the deployable kits.</p>
<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>
<p>Before a firm can be nominated to the bidders list for this ICB procurement, it must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis. The U.S. Department of Commerce approves U.S. firms that have a professionally active facility (office, factory, laboratory, etc.) located within the United States.</p>
<p>U.S. firms will find a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application at the following website:</p>
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/osies/natoprograms/index.htm</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA. The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- The title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- The name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. A DOE is used to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>Using the contact information on the DOE, the NATO contracting agency will contact the firm directly when the IFB has been issued.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DEADLINES</p>
<p>1. Final date to request a DOE (and, for U.S. facilities not yet approved for NATO ICB, to submit a completed NATO ICB application): March 04, 2011<br />2. Anticipated release of IFB will be issued: March 2011<br />3. Bid closing date: second half of April 2011<br />4. Contract award: second quarter of 2011</p>

Title:  Fitch Solutions Subscription
Agency Contact Information:Acquisition Services DirectorateNational Business CenterDepartment of the Interior381 Elden Street, Suite 4000Herndon, VA 20170
Place of Performance:  Washington, DC
The Government intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed-price (FFP) acquisition with Fitch Solutions. This non-competitive action is being issued by the Acquisition Services Directorate under the authority of the Department of the Interior Franchise Fund on the behalf of the United Stated Department of Agriculture (USDA), Foreign Agricultural Services (FAS).  
Description of Requirement:  
The Risk and Asset Management (RAM) branch of the Foreign Agricultural Services (FAS) reviews and approves limits for foreign countries and foreign banks for the Commodity Credit Corporation's export credit guarantee programs.  Given limited travel funds, RAM can do very little travel to any of the countries in which these banks are located.  Therefore, RAM uses reports generated by third parties such as Fitch Solutions Inc. as a source of current information about countries, banking systems and specific foreign banks throughout the world in order to conduct our financial analysis of these countries and foreign banks.  Fitch has offices in these countries and spends significant time with each rated foreign bank in order to do an in-depth analysis.  Fitch also does an analysis of the sovereign government and the banking system in these countries and RAM relies on all of these reports to conduct its own analysis in order to establish country and bank credit limits.  This subscription allows RAM access to the ongoing reviews and reports for 100 foreign banks (our current portfolio encompasses approximately 150 foreign banks), including the specific analyses of these banks and the countries in which they are located as well as their banking systems.  This service is used to enable RAM staff to fully identify and analyze the financial condition of foreign banks and U.S. banks that are granted credit limits or participate in CCC's export credit guarantee programs.  This is a proprietary, electronic analytical service available from one and only one source.
This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source, and solicited in accordance with FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Fitch Solutions currently provides these types of subscriptions.  No other organization is known to provide these types of subscriptions.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities regarding this requirement by submitting a capabilities statement by the date specified herein.  
The period of performance for this effort will be one year.  The Government will consider all capabilities statements received by 12pm EST, Wednesday, March 9 , 2011.  Please be advised that it is the offeror's responsibility to assure the Government receives your submission on or before the specified due date.  Submissions shall be sent electronically to Michael McGuire, Contracting Officer at mike.mcguire@aqd.nbc.gov.
This is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this announcement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received is solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition. The Government reserves the right to issue a Request for Quote (RFQ) as a result of this announcement.  Please be advised that this announcement may constitute the only notice that will be posted for this acquisition, based on the review of any responses to this notice.

Title:  Bureau Van Dijk's electronic Bankscope subscription
Agency Contact Information:Acquisition Services DirectorateNational Business CenterDepartment of the Interior381 Elden Street, Suite 4000Herndon, VA 20170
Place of Performance:  Washington, DC
The Government intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed-price (FFP) acquisition with Bureau Van Dijk Electronic Publishing. This non-competitive action is being issued by the Acquisition Services Directorate under the authority of the Department of the Interior Franchise Fund on the behalf of the United Stated Department of Agriculture (USDA), Foreign Agricultural Services (FAS).  
Description of Requirement:  
The Risk and Asset Management (RAM) branch of the Foreign Agricultural Services (FAS) reviews and approves limits for foreign countries and foreign banks for the Commodity Credit Corporation's (CCC) export credit guarantee programs.  Given limited travel funds, RAM can do very little travel to any of the countries in which these banks are located.  Therefore, RAM uses reports generated by third parties such as Bureau Van Dijk's Bankscope as a source of current information about specific foreign banks throughout the world in order to conduct our financial analyses of these foreign banks.  This service is used to enable RAM staff to fully identify and analyze the financial condition of foreign banks and U.S. banks that are granted credit limits or participate in CCC's export credit guarantee programs.
Bureau Van Dijk's Bankscope is the largest database provider of bank financial statements and the only reputable vendor of this product which RAM requires in order to complete its mission.  Bureau Van Dijk provides financial statements, financial ratios, ownership (parent and subsidiary) information as well as external rating agency country and bank-specific ratings which allows RAM to conduct its financial analyses in a timely and efficient manner.  This subscription allows all RAM analysts to access and manipulate a comprehensive global database containing information on over 29,000 public and private banks throughout the world, including 16 years of detailed accounts, ratios, ratings and ownership information.  This database allows RAM to fill the analysis gap when we do not have access to a bank's financial statements or its financial ratios.  It also permits RAM to produce a comparative analysis between a bank and its peer group within a country without the time and expense of visiting the banks.  This service is deemed available only from this source and is considered a proprietary electronic analytical service.
This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source, and solicited in accordance with FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Bureau Van Dijk Electronic Publishing currently provides these types of subscriptions.  No other organization is known to provide these types of subscriptions.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland intends to negotiate and award a purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures under FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)with Altos Photonics, Inc in Bozeman, Montana for the purchase of a Ekspla Broadly Tunable Laser System.
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500.</p>
<p>NIST requires a broadly tunable laser system with picosecond pulses to be used in the energy research program of the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology. The main purpose of the system is to provide a reliable picoseconds source in the near-IR and MID-IR spectral region to be used as an external light source for an "Atomic Force/mid-IR imaging system". The lasers purpose is to extend the spectroscopic spectral range, spectral resolution and sensitivity of the atomic force/mid IR imaging system. The integrated, one of a kind, measurement system that will result will provide topological, chemical (infrared), thermal, and mechanical properties mapping with high spatial resolution (beyond the diffraction limit of infrared radiation). This instrument will allow establishment of a comprehensive measurement tool to characterize nanomaterials at single particle level.</p>
<p>Ekspla is the only responsible source that manufactures a commercially available infrared broadly tunable (1.55 - 16 &micro;m) picoseconds (&lt; 100 ns) laser system with large energy per pulse (up to 500 &micro;J), small line width (&lt; 1 cm-1) and high repetition rate (1 kHz) capable of meeting NIST's minimum requirements.</p>
<p><br />NIST requires this unique technology that was developed to allow high repetition rates and fast wavelength selection which is fundamental to the lasers intended application.</p>
<p>Altos Photonics, Inc. is the sole representative of Ekspla in the United States. There are no other distributors of this system in the United States. There are no other types of instruments that have the mechanical design characteristics of the Ekspla laser system that NIST requires. Hence, for the specific CNST nanotechnology applications, the Ekspla laser system is the only instrument that can meet our needs for high repetition rates and fast wavelength selection and Altos Photonics, Inc. is the only source of this instrument.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, responses received by March 14, 2011 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government whether to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

Projects may include new construction/repair of facilities, site/waterfront/airfield facilities, water treatment/distribution, drainage and sewage/solid waste/hazardous waste collection/treatment systems, landscaping, and environmental remediation in various NAVFAC Pacific locations.
  If asbestos or hazardous materials exist, the Architect-Engineer (A-E) contractor shall identify and provide recommendations for their disposal in the required documents in accordance with applicable rules and regulations pertaining to such hazardous materials.  The selected A-E may be required to participate in a pre-fee meeting within seven days of notification and provide a fee proposal within ten days of the meeting.  The contract will be of the Indefinite Quantity type where the work will be required on an as needed basis during the life of the contract providing the government and contractor agree on the amount.  Each project contract will be a firm fixed price A-E Contract.  The Government will determine the delivery order amount by using rates negotiated and negotiate the effort required to perform the particular project.
  The contract term will be a base year and two one-year option years.  The total fee for the contract term shall not exceed $7,500,000.  The Government guarantees a minimum of $10,000.  Estimated construction cost of project is between less than $5,000 and $50,000,000.  Estimated date of contract award is June 2011.  Proposals may be subject to an advisory audit performed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.  The following selection evaluation criteria, in relative order of importance, will be used in the evaluation of A-E firms: 

(1) Professional qualifications of firm and staff proposed for in designing wastewater/potable water collection/distribution and treatment systems, site development including roadways and drainage systems, and solid/hazardous waste collection and disposal systems including subsurface environmental investigations and designing in tropical environments similar to Hawaii, Guam, and Pacific Ocean areas; 

(2) Specialized recent experience and technical competence of firm or particular staff members in designing wastewater/potable water collection/distribution and treatment systems, site development including roadways and drainage systems, and solid/hazardous waste collection and disposal systems including subsurface environmental investigations and designing in the tropical environments similar to Hawaii, Guam, and Pacific Ocean areas;

(4) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time; 

(5) Knowledge and demonstrated experience in applying sustainability concepts and principles to facilities and infrastructure problems through an integrated design approach; 

(6)  A-Es quality control program experience; 

(7) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project; 

(8) Extent to which firms identify and commit to small business (SB), small disadvantaged business (SDB), women-owned small business (WOSB), historically underutilized business zone small business (HUBZoneSB), historically black college or university and minority institution (HBCU/MI) and veteran-owned small business (VOSB), and service disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) in performance of this contract, whether as a joint venture, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor.
  For this selection criteria, the government will evaluate proposals based on two Sub-factors:  (A) Past performance in Utilization of Small Business Concerns and (B) Participation of Small Business Concerns in this Project;  

(9) Volume of work previously awarded to the firm by the Department of Defense shall also be considered, with the object of effecting an equitable distribution of Department of Defense A-E contracts among qualified A-E firms and firms that have not had Department of Defense contracts. 

Include a summary of qualifications in narrative discussion addressing each of the above selection evaluation criteria on the SF 330, Part 1, Section H.  If necessary, continue on plain bond paper.
 For selection criteria (3) the government will also evaluate each firms past performance and performance rating(s) from the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) during the evaluation process, which can affect the selection outcome.  For selection criteria (8), the Government will evaluate firms by:  In support of Sub-factor (A), (1) the offeror shall provide historical data on utilization of SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZoneSB, and SDVOSB over the past three years showing dollar value, percentage of work (of total contract value) subcontracted to large businesses, SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZoneSB,  and SDVOSB, (2) Information on national awards received within the past three years for outstanding support to SB concerns, (3) Information showing ratings received on completed projects with regards to the firms implementation of subcontracting plans, (4) Information on any existing, planned or pending mentor-protg agreements under either the DOD or SBA Programs, (5) Information on use of Community Rehabilitation Program organizations certified under the Javis Wagner ODay Program and (6) Final SF 294s on projects completed within the past 3 years.

Price is a secondary factor after past performance. 

The Government reserves the right to award the contract to other than the lowest priced offer. 

The winning offeror will be selected by ranking the offerors that have submitted acceptable offers and making a series of paired (two-at-a-time) comparisons among them, trading off the difference in risk against the difference in price between the members of each pair, as follows: 

If one offeror is the lower risk and offers the lower price, award will be made to that offeror. 

If one offeror is the lower risk but offers the higher price, a decision will be made as to whether the difference in risk is worth the difference in price.
 If the lower risk is considered to be worth the higher price, then the offeror with the higher price will be considered to be the better value. If not, then the offeror with the lower price will be considered to be the better value. 

This series of paired comparisons will continue in this manner until a decision is reached as to which offeror represents the best value.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

VA Boston Healthcare has one of the largest and most active research programs in the VA nationwide. The Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center (MAVERIC) Core Laboratory processes and stores specimens for clinical trials run by the VA Cooperative Studies Program.  The requested product is necessary to guarantee accurate and sufficient identification and storage of samples, to provide study stake-holders and analysis labs with high quality samples, and to facilitate the processing of such a large volume of samples.  These cryovials are automation "friendly". Automation friendly implies that the tubes must be in standard SBS microplate format so they are aligned with the pipettor of the automated system.

On an operational level the storage schema of the laboratory is centered around the exact specifications of these storage vials. Each current piece of automated equipment is set up and calibrated for this specific consumable's specifications. More specifically, the robotic hardware has been calibrated for the exact dimensions of this tube and its corresponding storage rack. The controlling software has been calibrated to recognize and handle this exact tube and its corresponding storage rack. Special automated equipment has been purchased to cap and uncap these tubes, and it will not currently work with any other tube or tube format. Custom freezer racks were designed against the exact dimensions of this tube and the corresponding storage rack. Additionally, the freezer identification and inventory system is being set up to read, track, and retrieve this exact cryovial.

This procurement will be a firm fixed price contract with no option years and shall be awarded. It is the Government's belief that only the proposed candidate possesses the required capabilities to successfully meet this requirement.

<DESC>The following information is provided as part of a market survey of industry to determine if any potential contractors have the skill, knowledge, abilities, and specific experience required to complete this effort. <br />The service needed is the modification of EWCU assets to incorporate new temperature limits for EWCU Internal Comparator Voltage. The Engine Warning Control Unit (EWCU) for F-16 Block 30/40/50, PN 5091200-003/004 (Block 30 &amp; 40) and PN 5091200-012 (Block 50), is currently set to give overheating warnings at the Pratt and Whitney engine high temperature limit which is approximately 100 degrees centigrade higher than the GE engine limit, allowing the GE engine to overheat before the pilot is warned. Current engine over heat warnings are 1000 degrees centigrade for Block 30/40 and 1100 degrees centigrade for Block 50. The intention of this modification is to correct this deficiency and allow the EWCU comparator voltage to warn at a lower temperature for GE equipped aircraft. <br />Assets needing modification: <br />Part number 5091200-003/004 to part number 5091200-014/018 for F-16 Blocks 30/40 Part number 5091200-012 to part number 5091200-016/020 for F-16 Block 50<br />The vendor must have access to the following Test Sets:<br />EWCU Manual Test Set - 5091B200 EWCU Automatic Test Set - 5091A200<br />No travel is required for this notice.

<DESC>This is a sources sought/market research notice conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10, Market Research. AFDW/PKI is seeking information on service-disabled veteran-owned small buisness concerns able to provide telecommunications engineering, design, planning, troubleshooting, infrastucture installation, problem diagnosis and repair of mission critical voice, video, and data network infrastructure to the 844th Communications Group (844 CG) located at Joint Base Andrews - Naval Air Facility Washington (JBA-NAFW). The 844 CG is in the middle of installing network infrastructure to support the William A. Jones III Building. The Jones Building is a $131.5 Million BRAC initiative to consolidate many Air Force organizations currently in leased office space throughout the National Capital Region into one 380,000 square foot facility. Direct experience in the design, planning, and computer network infrastructure of the Jones Building is required. Experience with and a working knowledge of the cable plant at JBA-NAFW is desired. Any delay in telecommunications installation and building certification will result in unacceptable cost overruns, as leases and service contracts associated with the old locations (i.e. security, janitorial) will need to be extended. <br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330, Engineering Services, Small Business Size Standard $4.5M. Please provide information on your company's capabilities, in writing, including business size and years of experience to Sheila Miller, Contract Specialist, Email sheila.miller@afncr.af.mil no later than 4:00PM eastern standard time 28 February 2011.

<DESC><p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), Glynco, GA<br />Glynco Satellite TV Equipment and Services</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI). The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center at Glynco, Georgia under the Department of Homeland Security is seeking contractors who are interested in providing commercial equipment and services to support the Satellite TV requirements of the FLETC. This notification is a request for information to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort for FLETC and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be accomplished. This is not a request for proposal or invitation for bid. FLETC is also seeking suggestions on structuring of pricing.</p>
<p>To be considered as a potential manufacturer/supplier source for this requirement, a contractor will be required to submit technical data verifying capabilities to produce/supply compliant items and services. All costs incurred by the contractor in responding to this request for information will be covered by the contractor. The Government does not intend to pay for any cost incurred by the contractor in providing this information. The contractor will be required to verify to the Government that the services to be supplied meet or exceed the expectations required for sustainment of the tactical communications equipment in the DHS inventory.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The FLETC currently has in place an existing CATV television service for the FLETC Glynco location. The proposed replacement is Satellite Television services. The proposed Satellite TV services will cover FLETC Glynco and Participating Offices (PO) buildings, dorms, and/or common areas, such as classrooms or lobbies. Installation will include five (5) insertion channels for FLETC information.</p>
<p>Current State:</p>
<p>FLETC Glynco currently has CATV and high speed internet service. The system provides service to approximately 2111 dorm rooms. 312 offices, 35 common areas and 15 high speed internet cable modems.</p>
<p>Future State:</p>
<p>Satellite television service will be provided by a central head end, and distributed via fiber optic cable and existing coax cable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this RFI effort is to gather information about equipment and services to support proposed Satellite Television services on the FLETC (Glynco) location. This proposed future acquisition implements one of the DHS Secretary's Efficiency Initiatives by establishing a DHS-wide sourcing vehicle for the acquisition of communications equipment and services. The Secretary's intent is to leverage DHS' buying power to receive high volume discounts and the lowest price possible when acquiring communications equipment and services. Services provided shall be on a principle period of performance (PPP) Monday through Sunday, twenty-four hours a day, including Federal Holidays. Contractor personnel may be required to be on-site to support the user during the PPP. During certain times, the contractor may be required to work overtime hours to perform mission essential tasks. DHS Quality Assurance Personnel (QAP) shall approve any overtime requests prior to any overtime work being performed.</p>
<p>The contractor may on occasion be required to perform outside of the core hours to support exercises or crisis situations within the United States as directed and approved by DHS QAP. All work required to be performed outside of the core hours will be considered over-time.</p>
<p>The local contractor will install the satellite dishes, head end racks, tuners, and multiplexers. FLETC will be providing the space for the head end, the fiber optic cabling to the buildings, the computers for the insertion channels, and the televisions. The Satellite Television provider will provide the installation, satellite dishes, tuners, multiplexers, amplifiers, splitters, and associated cabling for each device.</p>
<p><br />Site Details:</p>
<p>The FLETC, Glynco, Georgia site is made up of approximately one hundred and sixty seven (167) buildings spread across approximately one thousand five hundred (1,500) acres.</p>
<p><br />Known Issues:</p>
<p>Of the approximately 167 buildings that currently have CATV service, only 75 have single mode fiber, at this time. We currently have the ability to insert up to five channels on the network from our head end. The exterior CATV coax infrastructure on the center is vast and serves almost every building on the center. It was upgraded at no extra cost to the FLETC back in 2004 and is monitored and repaired frequently without prompting or extra cost to the FLETC. The current CATV provider is responsive when trouble calls are placed to service personnel, but have demonstrated past deficiencies when attempting to support installations into new building on the facility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Task Requirements</p>
<p>Financial Management: The Government objective is to firm-fixed price equipment and, as much as possible, services/supplies. In the case of services/supplies that cannot be firm-fixed priced, the contractor shall provide all financial management support for the following areas:</p>

<DESC>This notice is a sources sought market survey announcement for written information only.  This notice does NOT constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, or invitation for bid.  The intent of this notice is to identify any potential offerors that are capable of completing this project.

Work under this project includes, but is not limited to the deconstruction, removal and recycling of the two (2) multi-effect evaporator units from the water front utility area.  The evaporators were constructed in 1989 to convert steam into drinking water, but are now obsolete.  The evaporator units need to be dismantled and removed from the installation, with recycling of the metals to reduce the cost to the Navy.
  The surrounding power and water production facilities must remain in operation during all removal activities, with no damage to these systems allowed.  This project is located at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
The evaporators units are constructed of carbon steel support columns and beams, with ancillary aluminum components including stairs, grates, cable trays, supports, light poles, and ladders.  The primary condenser vessels are carbon steel shells and interior supports are approximately 15 feet in diameter and 160 feet long.  The condensers contain aluminum tubing mounted on the interior support structure. Piping on the evaporator units is a combination of fiberglass-wrapped plastic pipe, stainless steel pipe, and galvanized steel pipe.
  Several steel chemical storage tanks are included with the evaporators including de-aerators, filters, and ion traps.  No asbestos is known to be associated with this equipment.  In addition to the recyclable metals found in the evaporators, numerous spools of copper wire may be included in this solicitation for removal.
The contractor will provide all the necessary equipment for completing this deconstruction and removal operation including weight handling equipment, cranes, manlifts, cutting tools and compressed gases, trucks, barges and roll-off containers.  The Government will not supply any equipment for this contract.  Barges or floating platforms may be anchored in the bay next to the site.
  A temporary storage/staging yard may be provided by the Naval Station for use by the contractor.  All current Navy safety instructions must be followed during completion of this work.
The magnitude of construction is between $500,000-$1,000,000.  The NAICS Code is 238910  with a Small Business Size Standard of $14.0 million.  The Government will use responses to this SOURCES SOUGHT announcement to make appropriate acquisition decisions in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 19.

  The written notification, which shall not exceed 5-10 written pages, must include (1) positive statement of intent to respond to any future solicitation as a prime contractor; (2) A listing of projects, with synopsis, completed as prime contractor, or major sub-contractor which were completed during the past five years, both for government and private industry (emphasis on Federal Government projects), that are similar in complexity and dollar value to the proposed project, citing the percentage of self-performed work for prime contractor projects.  The type of project, dollar value, contract number, location and point of contact are to be included.  Relevant projects for this sources sought include major renovation or demolition work on industrial buildings that contain any of the following:  environmental waste handling experience for containment of asbestos or lead-based paint, safety requirements that will cover work outside and overhead, and experience working around and within an operational facility in an industrial setting.
  Projects must have been completed by the offeror within the last five years and have a construction value of $1 million or greater.  Renovation projects that do not contain all of the above components shall not be considered relevant.  (4) A brief outline of resources, subcontractors, and key personnel that would be used to accomplish the contract.  (5) Bonding capacity:  Provide name of surety, your maximum bonding capacity per project, and your aggregate maximum bonding capacity.  Due to the government reserving the right to set this acquisition aside for Small Businesses based on the responses it receives, it is imperative that firms respond with the required information for capabilities to be accurately evaluated.

The NARS are designed using state-of-the art survey techniques to randomly select sites to represent the conditions of aquatic resources at multiple spatial scales. Field crews use the same and often innovative protocols at all sites to ensure that results are nationally comparable. For many of the indicators selected for research purposes, scientists analyze the results against reference conditions derived from water bodies judged to have been the least disturbed by human activities. This relatively new survey and continuing research program provides statistically valid data and information vi tal to describing water resource quality conditions across the country, how these conditions vary with geographic setting, and the extent of human and natural influences.
A draft copy of the performance work statement (PWS) is included as an attachment.
Interested parties with the capability of providing any of the services described in the draft PWS posted at the EPA CPOD website: http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/ are invited to submit, in writing, sufficient information that clearly demonstrates their ability to provide the services described in the draft PWS, including personnel, experience and qualifications. A description of similar services previously or currently provided shall be provided. Standard company brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this Sources Sought Synopsis. The applicable NAICS code is 541620 with a size standard of $7 million in average annual receipts. In the capabilities statements, contractors must provide their size status for the above referenced NAICS code, (i.e. large, small) and whether or not they are a certified hub zone, 8(a), women owned, small disadvantaged and/or service disabled veteran owned concern.  As a reminder, small businesses are required to perform at least  50 percent of the costs of the contract performance with their own personnel (See FAR 52.219 14) under a procurement set aside for small businesses.  The EPA reserves the right to set this action aside for small businesses.  Responses to the above should be submitted to Tammy Adams at adams.tammy@epa.gov by 4:00 p.m. EST, on March 10, 2010.

<DESC>GENERAL INFORMATION <br /><br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) to supplement existing market research conducted by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). This RFI is not a request for proposals; therefore, responses to this notice will not be considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a contract. Parties that respond to this RFI are advised that the NRC will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all cost associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the submitting party's expense.
<p>PURPOSE<br /><br />The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) seeks information to determine the commercial availability and technical capabilities of qualified and responsible sources and/or Government Shared Service Providers that are currently capable of providing solutions for the potential requirements described in this RFI. The information that NRC gathers from this RFI and related market research is for planning purposes only and may be used to assist the NRC in planning an acquisition strategy if a new acquisition is deemed appropriate by NRC.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br /><br />The Federal Government placed greater demand on the security clearance and suitability process and Congress enacted the Intelligence Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act of 2004. This act, among other legislative and OMB mandates, requires federal agencies to reduce the time it takes to conduct a background investigation and provide end-to-end automation of processes that supports determining suitability eligibility, creating adjudicative actions, and the granting of security clearances. Many Federal agencies currently experience significant delays for both Government employees and their contractors, due to out-dated processes, procedures, and technology constraints.</p>
<p>The NRC Office of Administration (ADM), Division of Facilities and Security (DFS), Personnel Security Branch (PSB) has recognized the need to modernize their business processes, procedures, and underlying technology. This initiative will allow PSB to become a more agile program that can not only meet current requirements, but also future requirements of both internal and external stakeholder's needs. <br /><br />PSB is challenged by an antiquated personnel security background investigation system. Due to a combination of inadequate documentation and obsolete technology, PSB is struggling to meet the ever-increasing demand for faster and more efficient processing and adjudication of cases. In 2010, the NRC initiated a business process analysis and mapping effort to define the business needs and business processes for providing end-to-end automation of the background investigation and adjudication processes.&nbsp; Not only will PSB need a system to satisfy its current needs, but also will need a system to have the ability to accommodate any future requirements and forecasted demands. PSB requires a customizable solution that will be easy to implement and get off the ground quickly, yet robust enough to change and grow over time.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING A RESPONSE TO THIS RFI<br /><br />In submitting responses please do so by e-mail to michael.turner@nrc.gov, with a courtesy copy to joseph.widdup@nrc.gov, by the response date for this notice. Responses should be submitted in a format that is readable in Microsoft Office Word 2007, Microsoft Office Excel 2007 and/or Adobe .pdf format and include responses to the seven questions listed below.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS FOR RESPONDENTS<br /><br />In order for NRC to learn about current commercial item offerings and capabilities for personnel security background investigation solutions, NRC strongly encourages that parties respond in writing to the questions below. Please correlate the response to the question number.</p>
<p>1. What size is your organization with respect to NAICS code 541511 (i.e. "small" or "other than small")? If your organization is a small business under the aforementioned NAICS code, what type of small business (i.e. small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, economically disadvantaged woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, 8(a), or HUBZone small business? Specify all that apply.<br /><br />2. Does your organization currently manufacture background investigation and security clearance case management commercial item solution(s)? If so, please describe those solutions, including software, services, training, etc. and include commercial price list(s) or range of commercial prices for those commercial item offerings. These may be cloud-based or non-cloud-based solutions. <br /><br />3. Is your organization an authorized reseller/business partner for case management commercial item solutions for background investigations and security clearance commercial item solutions? If so, then please indicate what those solutions are and provide commercial price list(s) or range of prices for those commercial item offerings.<br /><br />4. Does your organization have experience as a prime contractor providing an end-to-end delivery of case management commercial item solutions for background investigations and security clearances for the U.S. (Federal) Government? If so, please provide a list of Federal Government clients, a complete description of the commercial item solution provided. Also, please indicate the number of years of experience that your organization has with each of those types of implementations as a prime contractor.<br /><br />5. Does your organization have experience as a prime contractor implementing OPM's e-Delivery as part of automating the end-to-end background investigation and security clearance process? If so, please describe your organization's experience in that area as a prime contractor and provide a list of Federal Government clients where your organization implemented the e-Delivery process. <br /><br />6. Does your organization have experience implementing FISMA-compliant solutions for any Federal Government agencies? If so, please list and describe those contracts (contract number, contract type, contract value, description of supplies and services included in the scope, period of performance, etc.) and indicate your organization's role (prime contractor, first tier subcontractor, and/or supplier).<br /><br />7.

<p><strong>BACKGROUND INFORMATION:</strong><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" />DoD is developing a Terminal &amp; Networking Roadmap (TNR) that engages with the DoD Laboratories to identify future technology insertion opportunities, that solicits gaps and issues from the Operational Community to determine communications needs as captured in DoD Roadmaps/Visions (i.e. Air Force 2020 Vision), and that discovers emerging technologies within Industry developed through research and development (R&amp;D) or from leveraging existing commercial IT advancements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The TNR will <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>provide decision makers with an enterprise level "strategic view" that lays out a timeline for making key decisions about terminal and networking technologies and defines the data required to make those decisions.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;MILSATCOM is a vital piece of the DoD communications architecture as it provides the space-based network connectivity needed to deliver global communications to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>tactical national security operations in areas that lack terrestrial infrastructure, as well as to mobile platforms. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The TNR will help decision makers within the DoD to examine all current, evolving, and futuristic ground networking infrastructure, and terminal architecture technologies that will be available in the 2020 to 2030 timeframe. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This examination will allow the DoD to take advantage of these capabilities and move forward on a path towards developing mitigation strategies for existing capability/requirement gaps and threats. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>With the current cancellation of the TSAT program, the role of the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) and Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) constellations is anticipated to expand to fill MILSATCOM capability and functionality gaps. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>DoD also turns to commercial SATCOM (COMSATCOM) assets to fill in essential bandwidth gaps, and appears willing to continue exploring SATCOM options such as leased capability and hosted payloads in the future.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><br />The operational requirements of the MILSATCOM terminal architecture are moving towards full functionality across multiple frequency bands and communication protocols. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>As such, future MILSATCOM architecture components (terminals, systems, ground infrastructure, etc.) should be designed with both the flexibility and adaptability to operate across different MILSATCOM satellite systems and communications layers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Commonality at the component level would increase terminal affordability and interoperability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In order for DoD to maximize the use of its existing SATCOM resources while leveraging new technologies, joint service collaboration and planning must be a part of a forward-moving strategy that focuses on; increased terminal capabilities, affordability, a unified approach to network management and connectivity, and decreased IA vulnerabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><br />The path to develop enhanced satellite terminals is challenging because many of the legacy satellite terminals and associated satellite systems were designed to function as independent systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Integrating these legacy systems with new technologies to meet DoD demands for a more interoperable, integrated SATCOM architecture is a huge challenge. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>An integral piece of this new architecture is the interoperability of the space, aerial, and terrestrial communications layers. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Changes in SATCOM demand (increased AISR and Communications On The Move (COTM), for example) within this integrated architecture require us to leverage legacy assets while exploring new technologies, incorporating a mix of SATCOM options to successfully meet the warfighter's operational requirements.</p>

The number of hospitalized TBI patients has increased in the last four (4) years due to combat in the Middle East.  The leading causes of TBI are bullets and fragments, blasts, falls, motor vehicle-traffic crashes and assaults.  Blasts are the primary cause, in combination with other events, of TBI for active duty military personnel in war zones.  The Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center (DVBIC) is a unique health care collaboration of the Department of Defense (DoD), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and civilian partners that promotes state-of-the-art medical care, innovative clinical investigations and educational programs to serve active duty military, their dependents and veterans with TBI.  DVBIC develops and provides advanced TBI-specific evaluation, treatment and follow-up care as well as effective educational materials for the prevention, treatment of TBI and management of its long-term effect.  DVBIC does not possess the human resources in order to fulfill its mission with federal government employees.  The center must supplement its workforce by contracting with a private entity that can provide the wide range of skill sets and knowledge necessary to meet the center's objectives.  <BR><BR>DVBIC is headquartered at Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) with across the CONUS and one OCONUS site, Landstuhl Regional Medical Center.  <BR><BR>This contract will support DVBIC HQ as well as all of the following Network Sites:<BR><BR>Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC), Washington, DC	<BR>Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC), Germany<BR>San Antonio Military Medical Center (SAMMC), TX	<BR>Fort Bragg, NC<BR>Naval Medical Center, San Diego (NMCSD), CA	<BR>Fort Carson, CO<BR>VA Center - Richmond, VA	<BR>Camp Lejeune, NC<BR>VA Center - Tampa, FL	<BR>Fort Hood, TX<BR>VA Center - Palo Alto, CA	<BR>Camp Pendleton, CA<BR>VA Center - Minneapolis, MN	<BR>VA Center - Boston, MA<BR>DVBIC-Johnstown, PA	<BR>DVBIC-Charlottesville, VA<BR>Fort Belvoir, VA	<BR><BR>The geographic dispersion of the sites provides convenience for patients and a greater population for the center, which increases the likelihood military and veterans will receive the proper evaluation and treatment for TBI.   <BR><BR>The following are the primary objectives for DVBIC program: <BR><BR> 	Develop or continue to deploy high-performing management, medical, scientific, and administrative personnel to provide state-of-the-art treatment and performance of all required DVBIC operation sites; <BR><BR> 	Develop or continue protocols, and training procedures for response to all manner of issues that may be present during contract performance;<BR><BR> 	Enhance the capabilities of the DVBIC and Department's operational elements and other Federal, State, and local agencies in TBI science and patient care to fulfill the DVBIC related missions; <BR><BR> 	Develop or continue methods and capabilities to manage and assess patient conditions and outcomes and anticipate emerging issues;<BR><BR>o	Develop and expand Telemedicine initiatives<BR>o	Develop and expand TBI education programs directed toward providers, patients and family members<BR><BR> 	Expand on-going TBI surveillance of military personnel returning from Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)/Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF);<BR><BR> 	Investigate the efficacy of a variety of medications and rehabilitation strategies in treating/eliminating the effects of TBI;<BR><BR> 	Conduct large-scale evaluation studies and surveys to assist with decisions regarding return to work, training, and battlefield operations and to monitor the incidence and type of brain injuries experienced in war and peacetime operations.<BR><BR>The primary objective for this procurement is to provide and improve TBI care for active duty military, guard, reserve, veterans, and their eligible beneficiaries through individual contract health care providers only to the extent necessary for providing the healthcare, research, clinical investigations, and other services required under this contract.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is conducting market research for lower torso ballistic protection.

Current operations expose Marines to Improvised Explosive Devices (IED).  Beyond the blast and damage done by fragments and shrapnel, these events can inject sand and debris into any resulting wound which may require debridement by medical personnel.  MARCORSYSCOM seeks information on commercial solutions which afford protection to the genitals, groin, perineum and closely adjacent areas of the body from sand and debris associated with explosive events.  Desired characteristics include: easy to clean, lightweight, stretchable fabric that is breathable and antimicrobial.  Further, the item could be worn for extended periods of time and would consist of multiple sizes.
  It should afford minimum ballistic protection levels from sand/debris traveling approximately 975 feet per second (protection from the high velocity sand/debris from buried IEDs and not necessarily the fragments of the IEDs themselves) with increased protection against larger fragmentation desired.  The increased performance desired should be at minimal additional weight, thermal burden or discomfort to the user.  All responses should include any available test data, evidence of use by government or other agencies, and any other pertinent information.  Specific areas of interest are as follows:

- What is the finished weight of the system for each available size?  The target population is from the 5th percentile female through the 95th percentile male.
- Is the system machine washable?  If so, please identify any restrictions.
- What are the special care and handling instructions (if any)?
- What is the area of protected coverage for this product (sq inches)?
- What is the level of protection (size of threat and velocity)?
- What is the published unit cost of the ballistic undergarment for each size?
- A description of the material properties of the fabrics selected in the design.

WRITTEN RESPONSES

Respondents are requested to include literature, brochures, capabilities and summaries directly addressing their ability to meet the ballistic undergarment capabilities described above.
  Responses should also address business size, facilities, manufacturing capability (expressed as thousands of pieces per month), and the ability, or planned ability, to meet all Berry Amendment requirements (references: USC, Title 10, Section 2533a; DFARS 225.7002).  Furnished written materials and any proprietary information will be protected when clearly identified as proprietary.  No telephonic responses will be accepted. Responses shall be submitted not later than 16 March 2011 to Jennifer Glenn, at jennifer.glenn@usmc.mil or via FEDEX/UPS to Commander, Marine Corps Systems Command, Attn Jennifer Glenn, 2200 Lester Street Quantico VA 22134-6050.   THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEMS/SERVICES, NOR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED.
 NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS

<DESC>Introduction: 

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  In accordance with FAR Part 10, Market Research, and as part of VA's market research process, this is a request for information (RFI) to assist us in developing an acquisition strategy for VA's claims processing systems. This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the VA.  The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified sources able to meet VA requirements, to assist in planning possible future technical requirements, determine the appropriate acquisition strategy, and understand commercial pricing practices and other market information readily available. Telephone inquiries and responses will not be accepted at this time since there is no further information available.  This announcement is based upon the best information available and is subject to future modification.  VA will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this RFI.  

Overview: 

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Chief Business Office (CBO) is engaging activities to establish a Transactional Repository to decrease fraud/waste/abuse, improve accuracy of payments and facilitate use of industry standard tools that allow automated assessment of payment data.  The CBO requires integration services to assure the most robust commercial off the shelf (COTS) product is implemented.

The repository will provide a view to all Purchased Health Care Claims data to facilitate goals for development of a robust fraud/waste/abuse program, decreasing improper payments, utilize industry standard health care claims tools and provide a broad view of payments across VHA Programs.  The tool sets will include both pre and post payment capabilities.

To assure the most timely and effective impact to our payer programs, CBO requires a phased approach to deployment.  This phased approach requires:
	
Phase 1:  Deployment of the COTS fraud/waste/abuse tool and predictve modeling sets integrated with current claims processing systems at locations across VHA including decentralized sites and a centralized payment processing location; includes a local transactional repository to incorporate pre/post payment edits and business intelligence applications.

Phase 2:  Deployment of the COTS fraud/waste/abuse and predictive modeling tool sets to be implemented at an enterprise-wide transactional repository that allows analytics and application of tools sets across all payment transactions.

There are multiple components that describe a coordinated approach to the development and or acquisition of the desired level of performance:
	
1.	A repository will be fed from multiple systems, this may require real time or near real time data transfers.  The repository will include a business intelligence (BI) application that will accommodate end user browsing and analysis, standardized reports, ad hoc queries and reports and business intelligence extractions which we anticipate will be used to manipulate dimensional presentation of data.  
2.	A health care claims predictive modeling application principally used for Fraud/Waste/Abuse detection.  
3.	A fraud/waste/abuse or claims scoring application to be used at the repository location to detect and deter fraud/waste and abuse.

Background: 

VHA is comprised of 21 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) that are each responsible for managing health care activities within their geographic area that can include six to ten medical facilities and a number of supporting outpatient facilities.  Details can be found at http://www.va.gov/directory/guide/division_flsh.asp?dnum=1. VA medical centers within a VISN work together to provide efficient, accessible health care to Veterans in their areas.  With 163 VAMCs nationwide, VHA manages one of the largest health care systems in the United States.

At times, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities cannot provide the entire necessary outpatient, inpatient, dental, and pharmaceutical care and services required by its patients.  Additionally, the Veteran may not be able to access VA health care facilities based on geographic constraints or due to medical emergencies; or it could be economically advantageous for the VA to provide treatment to Veterans within the community they reside.  In these cases, the VA may authorize and pay for medical care to private sector providers for those Veterans who meet the eligibility requirements.  This concept is referred to as Fee Basis (or non-VA purchased) care.  With the exception of some medical emergencies, outpatient Fee care must be authorized before Veterans receive services from non-VA facilities/providers. 

In addition, CBO Purchased Care manages large health care payer programs, centralized in Denver.  These include the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the VA (CHAMPVA), Spina Bifida (SB), and Foreign Medical Program (FMP).  These health care payer programs also require similar tool sets and will be included in the enterprise transactional repository.

Across all Purchased Care Programs, VA has seen significant issues with improper payments.  Currently VA lacks industry standard automated tool sets to identify and take action on improper payments including fraud/waste/abuse.  CBO seeks assistance with implementing the appropriate tools to improve our program.

The goals for the RFI include:

o	Improve operational efficiency
"	Eliminate improper payments
"	Observe and track field operational best practices
"	Operate as a tightly integrated, operational system 
o Centralize control of business rules and fraud waste and abuse detection
o Improve efficient processing, payment or denial, of health care claims submitted by non-VA providers
For the purpose of this RFI, "enterprise" is defined as deployment across all Purchased Care Program sites.  Solutions to be considered shall include: application software and all necessary hardware (servers).

Requirements:

1.	Assessment of capabilities to perform requirements noted in the RFI

2.	Assessment of the types of changes required to accomplish the goals

3.	Approach to be utilized to develop necessary changes to the systems to meet the organizational goals

4.	Draft schedule to complete necessary changes.  

5.	System functionality shall include:
a.	Enterprise-wide transactional repository with associated 	business intelligence applications
b.	COTS predictive modeling tool
c.	COTS health care claims scoring tool
d.	Reduced Non-VA expenditures
e.	A single national level view to all Non VA Purchased Care claims activity including everything from operational activity to individual claim detail.
6.	Ability to create all required interfaces (from end-to-end) in accordance with industry standards to communicate with VA information (legacy) systems:  
a.	Examples of the type of interface issues to be considered:
1.	Programming M code (i.e. MUMPS - Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System), to add/modify within the VistA application   
2.	Use of a government provided VistA test environment 
3.	Ability to capture interface details through the creation of a formal Interface Control Document (ICD)
4.	SQL Server extract/transform/load functions
5.	Wide area transmission of extracted data from 33 FBCS (SQL) Servers
6.	CHAMPVA systems

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Service Area Office East, Network Contracting Activity 8, West Palm Beach, FL intends to solicit on a sole source basis for parts, labor, digital control programming, digital outputs and exhaust fan cycling for 52 existing proprietary Siemens air handler units, as well as all related wiring and construction modification as necessary. This is not a solicitation. This is market research for informational purposes only. Do not submit bids or proposals for this project. The government is seeking any manufacturer or company who is authorized to modify and/or enhance the proprietary Siemens System 600/Apogee System and can provide an "equal" or better product. The project requires the installation of panels, controllers, power supplies and relays to control the minimum OA dampers on 52 AHU's.  In order to prevent rapid closing/slamming of the dampers, restrictors shall be installed to allow dampers to close slowly, minimum of 15 seconds to close. The project also includes point creation within the BAS as well as programming of the system for efficient use. In addition to controlling the outside air dampers, this project also requires the modification of the exhaust air system in the building.  In general, by closing off 159,000 cfm of supply air entering the building, we must also limit exhausting a percentage of that air to maintain a building with a slightly positive pressure.  Therefore, this project also calls for the programming of certain exhaust fans to be cycled off during modified outside air dampers events. A single emergency point shall be created and graphically represented on the main graphic screen and shall shut off all dampers and associated exhaust fans upon with an interacting icon on the graphic's screen.  The OA Damper project is also intended to be used in the future with daytime control CO2 controls. This project will also provide a means to close outside air dampers to the facility when perimeter outdoor environmental concerns are present surrounding the facility.  

Firm shall be capable of completing performance of this project within twelve weeks of receipt of Notice to Proceed.  BAS parts are required for this project and are available on GS Schedules.  Pricing from GSA Schedules are required.  Work shall be performed at the VA Medical Center located at West Palm Beach, Florida, Building #1.

If you are qualified and authorized to provide the specified equipment, parts and labor on the Siemen's System 600/ Apogee System and provide necessary construction to integrate the system with existing systems in the building, submit your authorization and qualifications to Deborah Murphy, Contracting Officer, Department of Veterans Affairs, SAO East, NCA 8, Building 12, 7305 N Military Trail, West Palm Beach, FL  33410. Email submissions are acceptable. Due date for all submissions is January 28, 2011 by 2:00 pm Eastern Standard Time. Please send your email submissions to Deborah.Murphy3@va.gov.  If you have any questions, please submit them via email.

Any degree of loss of services is a critical risk to the Air Force's mission. It is apparent that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays and substantial duplication of cost to the Government, which would not be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, in accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), "all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency." Not awarding this contract would cause serious injury to the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition of the work required for the bridge contract period would be advantageous to the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this contract, based on this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Written comments or questions regarding this notice must be e-mailed to Ms. Margaret Santos at margaret.santos@buckley.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>This posting serves as notice of intent that the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service, located in Miami, FL intends to issue a fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract for sea turtle satellite tags, both FASTLOC GPS and POP -UP ARCHIVAL TRANSMITTING satellite tags. The satellite tags are used for sea turtle research to determine the impact of fisheries interaction, assess annual survival rates, and spatial distribution of sea turtles. The government intends to award a fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract on a sole source basis to the following entity: Wildlife Computers, Inc., 8345 154TH Ave. NE, Redmond, Washington 98052. A Sources Sought Notice entitled NOAA - SEA TURTLE SATELLITE TAGS was posted in the FEDBIZOPPS on 02/15/2011 for seven calendar days from which no responses were received. As a result of having received no responses, the government intends to issue a sole source contract to Wildlife Computers, Inc. under the authority of Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (Title VIII, PL 103-355) as implemented at Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 12.102 and Subpart 13.106-1(b) for simplified acquisition and the authority of the test program for commercial items section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996. Justification for Sole Source: The specifications for the sea turtle satellite tags can be found in the Sources Sought Notice and are not reiterated here. However, those specifications are essential to ensure the compatibility of results with earlier results of similar studies; the Government has since deployed more than 47 such tags in a post-hooking mortality study for ESA-protected loggerhead sea turtles. Wildlife Computers is the only company that has popup satellite archival tags with operational protocols that ensure that even if the turtle dies wearing the tag, scientists will get back the data transmitted through the ARGOS satellite system. These protocols include a mechanical failsafe system that releases the tag prior to the popup date if the turtle sinks past 1500m and software that allows researchers to program the tag to release prior to its programmed date if the animal maintains a specified depth range for a particular time period. The PAT tags also can be programmed to transmit intermittently while still attached to the turtle to provide data critical to using known-fate mark-recapture analysis methods. Wildlife Computers, Inc. designed and built the above sea turtle satellite tags in cooperation with the NMFS and it holds all proprietary drawings, engineering data, patents, copyrights, and parts necessary to manufacture these tags. The determination by the government not to compete the acquisitions is solely within the discretion of the government. This Notice of Intent does not invite a response. However, if a response is received it will be provided to the end user for future consideration.

<CONTACT>Daniel App, Contract Specialist, Phone 3014923606, Fax 3014923437, Email Daniel.App@nrc.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to enter into a sole source contract with Dycoda, LLC, for work related to completing the MELCOR code run code for the Surry Plant analysis for State-of the Art Reactor Consequence Analysis (SOARCA). Dycoda, LLC, is the only commercially available source that is uniquely qualified to perform the proposed work under this requirement. Over the past four and half years Dycoda has been providing the NRC with technical expertise in performing MELCOR analyses for the ISLOCA scenario as part of the SOARCA project. Consequently, Dycoda and its staff have acquired the unique institutional knowledge and experience in applying thermal hydraulic codes to severe accident analysis, including SCDAP, RELAP, and MELCOR codes necessary to successfully complete this project. Moreover, Dycoda's expertise with the SOARCA project is unique because it developed and employed a "best estimate" consequence analyses approach that discusses mitigative measures. <br />Now in the final year of the project, the NRC staff estimates the completion of the project by another contractor would require a minimum of 10 additional months of effort (6 months to familiarize themselves with the project and 4 months to train staff) at double the estimated cost, which is not expected to be recovered via a competitive acquisition process. This effort is considered to be a logical follow-on to the work performed by Dycoda, LLC. Given its previous experience with the project, it is reasonable to conclude that Dycoda is the only source that has the necessary knowledge, staff, skills, and technical expertise to successfully complete this project timely and efficiently. <br />The work will include but it not limited to:<br />- Re-running the Surry OSLOCA scenario to account for new plant configuration information received from the Surry Plant. <br />- Finalizing the already-started MELCOR analysis for the Surry Plant for SOARCA.<br />- Working to address SOARCA Peer Review Committee comments on SOARCA for Surry.<br />- Working to address NRC comments on SOARCA for Surry.<br />- Presenting work completed for this project at public forums. <br />The period of performance will be nine (9) months from the date of award. This is not a request for competitive proposals. Requests for copies of this solicitation will not be honored unless the respondent provides evidence showing their capability to perform the required services. Inquiries regarding this announcement may be made to Daniel App, Contract Specialist by phone at (301) 492-3606 or via e-mail at Daniel.App@nrc.gov. See Numbered Note 22.<br />

<SUBJECT>--SALE OF FEDERAL NATURAL GAS
<SOLNBR>
<CONTACT>John Hamak - 806-356-1025
<DESC>INVITATION FOR OFFERFEDERAL GAS FROM CLIFFSIDE HELIUM ENRICHMENT UNIT IFO No. BLM-CHEU-001April 2011  March 2012
Introduction
The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) of the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) is requesting written offers from pre-qualified companies (see Pre-Qualification and Credit Requirements) to purchase Federal gas produced from the Bureau of Land Managements (BLM) Cliffside Helium Enrichment Unit (CHEU).  The BLMs CHEU is located in Potter County, Texas near the city of Amarillo. 
Production from the CHEU is delivered into El Paso Natural Gas (El Paso) natural gas transmission system via El Pasos Cliffside lateral line.  The BLM has contracted with El Paso for firm transportation over this lateral.  This firm contract includes access to interconnects with Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) and El Paso Natural Gas (El Paso), also located in Potter County, Texas.   
This sale is for a twelve month term beginning on April 1, 2011.  The buyer will take custody of the Federal gas at the interconnect of the CHEU and the Cliffside lateral (delivery point) and will schedule and nominate the gas at and downstream of this point.
Written offers via facsimile (fax no. 806-356-1041) are due by 11:00 a.m. CDT on March 18, 2011.  We will verbally notify award winners by 3:00 p.m. CDT on March 25.  Please call John Hamak at 806-356-1025 with questions about this Invitation for Offer (IFO).				Offers
The Attachment is the offer sheet containing the meter numbers, estimated daily production, preferred index prices, interconnect meter numbers, and contact information.  Your offer, expressed as an increment or decrement in relation to the index price, should be placed in the appropriate offer sheet column.  Please note that we are selling all of this gas under a swing obligation on the daily market rather than using a baseload and swing component.   The CHEU volume may increase or decrease through the term of this sale although BLM anticipates relatively stable production rates. 
The BLM and the buyer will mutually agree to pricing remedies when:
	The index price does not post or is removed;	Gas cannot flow on the pipeline specified due to pipeline operational issues;	Gas flow is disrupted due to Force Majeure, including acts of God.
Consideration of Offers
The BLM may award a contract on the basis of initial offer(s) received without discussion.  Accordingly, each initial offer should be submitted on the most favorable terms that the offeror can submit.  However, the BLM may negotiate with offerors in the event offers of similar or unanticipated value are received.  The BLM may ask for a refreshed offer in these cases and ask the offeror to submit the refreshed offer via email to john_hamak@BLM.gov.
The BLM shall award a contract resulting from this IFO to the offeror whose offer, in BLMs sole judgment is the most advantageous to the Federal Government.  The BLM will confirm award to the buyer by means of its Natural Gas Transaction Confirmation and Agreement (TC). The BLM will be the confirming party for both the TC and any subsequent revisions to the TC.
Term
Deliveries of the Federal CHEU gas to the buyer will commence on April 1, 2011.  The delivery period will be for a term ending March 31, 2012. 
The reasons for which the BLM may declare an early cancellation may be, but are not limited to:
	The failure to pay, when due, any payment required under this agreement, if such failure is not remedied within 5 business days after written notice of such failure, provided that the payment is not the subject of a good faith dispute and the buyer provides documentation described under Payment Terms. 
	The failure to provide adequate financial assurances to the BLM specified under Pre-Qualification and Credit Requirements. 
	Any representation or warranty which is proven to have been false or misleading in any material respect when made or deemed to be repeated.
Transportation and Scheduling of Federal Gas 
The buyer agrees to take 100% of the Federal gas delivered at the delivery point for the entire contract period.  The BLM will use reasonable efforts, consistent with industry practice, to inform the buyer regarding significant changes in gas production levels, gas quality, and production shut-ins.  The buyer, through customary industry practice set forth by North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB) and the Council of Petroleum Accountants Societies (COPAS) in nominating and scheduling transportation services, will communicate directly with the BLM.  
The buyer, at its expense, shall make all necessary arrangements to receive delivery of Federal gas at the delivery point.  Therefore the buyer, taking gas downstream of the delivery point on purchasers contract, will be responsible for associated penalties, imbalance cashouts and penalties, as well as pipeline imbalances scheduled by buyer.  The buyer is not responsible for costs of transportation upstream of the delivery point nor is it responsible for the Cliffside lateral transportation cost.
No later than eight calendar days before the first day of each month, the BLM will notify the buyer of the daily gas volume and quality anticipated for the following month of production.  The buyer understands that any such estimate is not a warranty of actual deliveries to be made but is provided to facilitate planning of delivery of royalty gas.  Actual volumes should be confirmed daily with the BLM. This will continue for each month of the royalty gas delivery period.  The buyer schedules; nominates and receives pipeline confirmations of flowing gas; the BLM is a read-only entity.   
 Governing Contract
This transaction is governed by the Gas Industries Standards Board (GISB) and/or NAESB contract signed between the buyer and BLM.  The provisions in this IFO are a condition of your purchase and are supplemental to the GISB and/or NAESB contract.  Conflicts between the GISB and/or NAESB contract and this IFO shall be resolved in favor of the IFO.
The BLM will send the successful offeror a Transaction Confirmation (TC) detailing the awarded package.  The TC will be deemed binding for both parties if the buyer does not either sign and return or note discrepancies within 2 business days from date of receipt. The BLM prefers that a fully executed TC be returned.
Pre-Qualification, and Credit Requirements
To pre-qualify, new offerors are required to sign the NAESB "Base Contract for Sale and Purchase of Natural Gas" including the BLM Special Provisions, and provide detailed financial information. If the offeror has previously signed the GISB contract or the NAESB, a new contract will not be required. Participants new to the program must have the NAESB signed and sent back to the BLM prior to bidding. Upon pre-qualifying, the BLM will issue an amount of unsecured credit based on the creditworthiness of the offeror.  In cases where pre-qualified offerors have submitted their most current financial documentation, no additional information will be required. Please be advised that the BLM will require a parent guaranty in situations where the company submitting the offer is a different entity than the company that has pre-qualified. 
The BLM reserves the right to request additional financial information in any situation it deems necessary and may reissue or suspend approved lines of credit. Furthermore, buyers are required to provide the BLM with any information regarding a significant, adverse change in their financial status that would affect the approved line of credit.  Such adverse changes would include a credit downgrade, material changes to liquidity or capital resources, noncompliance with financial covenants in debt documents, or significant market events affecting operations, revenues, or assets. Further, should the creditworthiness, financial responsibility, or ability to perform become unsatisfactory to the BLM at any time during the term of this agreement, satisfactory assurance may be required as a condition to further performance under the agreement. 
For awards exceeding the amount of unsecured credit issued by the BLM, buyers will be required to provide secured financial assurance in the form of an Irrevocable Letter of Credit (ILOC), Bond, or other BLM-acceptable surety instrument 5 business days prior to first receipt of natural gas under the contract.  The financial assurance amount shall be sufficient to cover the value of 60 days of deliveries of the estimated production of all royalty gas awarded, less the amount of unsecured credit issued by the BLM as previously notified.  For new surety instruments, the BLM will contact you regarding the calculation of an estimated amount of surety to be provided prior to initial deliveries.  For continuing surety instruments, we will contact you regarding renewal requirements. Significant and sustained increases in the value of natural gas during the term of the contract may result in requiring an increase in the amount of financial assurance. Failure to provide requested surety within 5 business days after the request has been made, may result in cancellation of the award or termination of the contract.
Payment Terms  
The BLM will invoice the purchaser for payments and transportation adjustments. 


Liquidated Damages
If the buyer requests an early contract cancellation in writing and the BLM agrees to the cancellation, the BLM will remarket the gas using commercially reasonable efforts in an arms-length transaction.  The BLM will collect from the terminated party, on a monthly basis, an amount equal to the positive difference, if any, between the original contract price and the price at which the gas was remarketed. The BLM will also notify the buyer of the new contract price before reselling the gas.  The BLM may also elect to enforce any liquidated damages specified in the signed GISB and/or NAESB contract.

<p>Synopsis SP3300-11-Q-0074 for the quantity of 400, 7535 Psion Teklogix Handheld Batteries was synopsized as a sole source requirement. Authorized resellers of this item have been discovered and therefore SP3300-11-Q-0074 will be cancelled and solicited as a competitive Combined Synopsis/Solicitation under SP3300-11-Q-0076.</p>

<p>See Attachment #1 schedule of supplies and services for CLIN identification.</p>
<p>Offerors shall provide a firm fixed unit price for each CLIN and the total amount inclusive of shipping cost FOB destination. Delivery is required 30 days after receipt of order to DLA Distribution Norfolk Virginia, Building W-143, Driveway 17, Receiving Officer (DDNV), Norfolk, VA 23512-5100.</p>
<p>This notice incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-48 effective 31 January 2011, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) Change Notice DPN 20110202 effective 02 February 2011, and Defense Logistics Agency Directive (DLAD) current to revision 5 and PROCLTR 2010-40. The complete text of the clauses and provisions in this notice may be accessed in full text at http://farsite.hill.af.mil.</p>
<p>The following clauses are incorporated for purposes of this notice and will be included in the contract award document by either reference or full text:</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offers-Commercial Items. Addenda to 52.212-1; the following paragraphs are hereby deleted from this provision: (d) products samples, (e) multiple offers and (h) multiple awards.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items; Evaluation for award shall be in accordance with FAR 13.106. The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this notice on an all or none basis to the responsible offeror whose offer is the lowest price who can meet the delivery requirements for this brand name procurement.</p>
<p><br />FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items. Addenda to 52.212-4; the following clauses apply:<br />The following clause is herby referenced by full text:<br />FAR 52.211-9 - Desired and Required Time of Delivery (Jun 1997)<br />(a) The Government desires delivery to be made according to the following schedule:<br /><br />DESIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE</p>
<p>ITEM NO. QUANTITY WITHIN DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT<br />0001 400 21<br />If the offeror is unable to meet the desired delivery schedule, it may, without prejudicing evaluation of its offer, propose a delivery schedule below. However, the offeror's proposed delivery schedule must not extend the delivery period beyond the time for delivery in the Government's required delivery schedule as follows:<br /><br />REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE</p>
<p>ITEM NO. QUANTITY WITHIN DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT<br />0001 400 30<br />Offers that propose delivery of a quantity under such terms or conditions that delivery will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the desired delivery schedule above will apply.</p>
<p><br /><br />OFFEROR'S PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE<br />ITEM NO. QUANTITY WITHIN DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT</p>
<p>(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated. Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.<br />(End of Clause)<br />DLAD 52.233-9000 Agency Protest (SEP 1999)</p>
<p>Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the Contracting Officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity's Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the Contracting Officer; this is not an appellate review of a Contracting Officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the Contracting Officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the Contracting Officer.<br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p>DLAD 52.233-9001 Disputes: Agreement to use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) (JUN 2001)</p>
<p>(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute.</p>
<p>(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1, or for the agency, by the Contracting Officer, and approved at a level above the Contracting Officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the Contracting Officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate.</p>
<p>(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here ( ). Alternate wording may be negotiated with the Contracting Officer.<br />(End of Provision)</p>

(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and 

(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record _Active_.

(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, _doing business as_ name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business days written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

               (iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds. 
          (2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and- 
               (i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or 
               (ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply. 
     (f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System. 
      (g) EFT and assignment of claims.

In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor.

"Best practices" i.e., those business processes determined to be most effective in the business community, were identified for the administrative areas at the NIH. Implementation will require configuration or changes to the new system that will adopt and integrate these best practices. Functional teams under the direction of a functional team manager have been established to oversee this effort. Functional teams will engage in a variety of duties including the design and configuration of the system, establishing workflow for the business processes, customization of the system (only if required and approved by the Steering Committee), defining system interfaces, and participation in pre-deployment and deployment activities.</p>

<p><br />It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), to procure consultant support services to the ETFC on a broad range of issues related to Title 42 versus Title 5 appointment mechanisms on behalf of the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>Title: NIH OER Consultation Support Services</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The NIH Office of Extramural Research (OER) has been tasked with continuing to provide expert consultant services in support of the NIH Extramural Title 42 Committee (ETFC), an NIH executive committee established to implement policies for extramural/policy staff on Title 42 appointments. This work will consist of reviewing complex scientific material in order to provide executive consultation and advice at regular meetings of the committee regarding the establishment of new T42 positions; Conversion of existing staff from T5 appointments to T42; analysis of information provided by NIH Institutes/Centers in relation to established criteria; and strategy recommendations for consideration by the NIH ETFC committee.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>The objectives of this contract are to provide expert consolation to the ETFC on a broad range of issues related to Title 42 versus Title 5 appointment mechanisms, as they relate to specific positions within the NIH extramural staff or similar agency.</p>
<p>SERVICES TO BE PERFORMED</p>
<p>General Requirements<br />Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the ETFC requires expertise and consultation from a source with current working knowledge of the responsibilities of senior extramural scientific positions and the history and intent of using the Title 42 and Title 5 mechanisms. Of paramount importance is a historical knowledge of the variety of positions that could possibly be included under Title 42, the various organizational structures used by the NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs), or similar agency, to perform functions included as "extramural" for the purposes of this activity. Additionally, the factors that should be considered by that agency as critical for determining the appropriate use of the Title 42 appointment for non-intramural scientists.</p>
<p>The vendor must develop an extensive historical background and current working knowledge of a broad range of issues related to Title 42 versus Title 5 appointment mechanisms as they relate to specific positions within the NIH extramural staff or similar agency. For example, an extensive understanding of the scientific missions and complexities of NIH ICs and the different extramural organizational structures relevant to the multiple categories in the NIH Extramural Professional Designation Model should be conveyed. The vendor must be able to analyze proposed scientific positions and prepare a justification for consideration by the ETFC in relation to established criteria as well as decisions on previous positions for consistency and fairness.</p>
<p>In addition, these projects must be started quickly in accordance with the NIH timeframes, to ensure that related position establishment and conversions are handled efficiently and without undue delay, as this could affect recruitment of senior-level scientific staff into extramural positions.</p>
<p>Specific Requirements<br />1. Provide expert consolation to the ETFC on a broad range of issues related to Title 42 versus Title 5 appointment mechanisms, as they relate to specific positions within the NIH extramural staff or similar agency.<br />2. Communicate regularly with the administrative coordinator for the ETFC on a variety of issues regarding Title 42(f) appointments and provide subject matter expertise, as necessary. <br />3. Conduct in-depth reviews of all proposals submitted for appointment any approved Title 42(f) position<br />4. Provide reports to the ETFC in the form of written summaries detailing proposed candidate's qualifications as they pertain to proposed Title 42(f) professional designation of the position, and the HHS peer review criteria. <br />5. Serve as a subject matter expert in providing consultation to the ETFC during bi-weekly meetings<br />6. Provide written reports of final reconsideration requests submitted for the approval of Title 42(f) position designations to the ETFC Chairmen</p>
<p>RESOURCES<br />Government will reimburse Contractor for travel expenses based on the established government per diem for an estimated 15 trips to Bethesda, MD.</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>March 21, 2011 through March 20, 2012 with two additional option years</p>
<p>Vendor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and Local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations applicable to its performance under this order.

Attachment A
Required Items and Minimum Performance Specifications
Sol-CI-11-00021
ITEM 1:     Particle Size Analyzer
Equipment Description:  Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) Instrument for the measurement of particle size and zeta potential.
 Minimum Specifications ? The following are  the minimum specifications of  the required Particle Size Analyzer:
The instrument must be able to operate in the following modes besides just the measurement of size and zeta potential:
Capable of making dynamic light scattering measurements, as well electrophoretic light scattering measurements for determining size, distribution, and zeta potential in the same instrument.
The specifications to bet met or exceeded are as follows:
Size measurementSize range 1.0 nm - 3 microns*Minimum sample volume 12&#956;LConcentration range 0.1mg/mL Lysozyme to 40%w/v*
Zeta potential measurementMinimum sample volume 0.75mLMaximum sample conductivity 200mS/cmMust allow use of disposable, folded-capillary cells with integrated electrodes in order to eliminate sample cross-contamination
General specificationsTemperature range 2?C to 90?CCondensation control Purge facility using dry airLaser 4mW He-Ne, 633nm
The instrument must incorporate non-invasive measurement fixed at 90 degrees.  The measurement must be internal to the DLS unit and optimally aligned with onboard cuvette holder assembly, not externally located.
The DLS instrument must employ Mixed Mode Measurement Phase Analysis Light Scattering (M3-PALS) for the measurement of zeta potential.  No other measurement mode will be acceptable.  The M3-PALS operation offers superior performance resulting in the ability to test even low mobility samples through combining both a fast field and slow field reversal.
The instrument must utilize, disposable zeta potential cells that eliminate sample cross-contamination and eliminate the need for washing/cleaning zeta potential cells/electrodes.  The cell is a flow-through design also capable of connecting with an autotitrator for determining the relationship between zeta potential and pH (or any other titratable function).  The cell utilizes a 5cm long U-shaped capillary cell for accurate measurement based on known theory.  It is not acceptable for just the cell or the electrodes to be disposable.  The entire cell and electrode combination must be disposable and optionally reusable.
A high efficiency avalanche photodiode detector (APD), specially selected for dynamic light scattering applications must be employed by the DLS instrument.
1 each Mini Tower PC, Windows XP, Intel Core 2 processor or equal, Optical Mouse, Keyboard, 19 inch Monitor and inkjet color printer.

<p><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />1. Past Performance: In accordance with FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and the following, the offeror is required to identify past or current contracts for efforts similar to this requirement. Offerors shall provide the information shown below for at least three (3) and no more than five (5) contracts for the same or similar items. Provide as a minimum the following applicable information for each contract:</p>
<p>a. Contract number, Names of contracting parties or agency, point of contact, specifically the Contracting Officer and the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), including email address and telephone number of these identified individuals.<br />b. Ship name, hull type, length, and displacement.<br />c. Type of availability (dry dock, dockside, etc.) and where performed;<br />d. Original contract commencement and completion dates, actual commencement and completion dates, and explanation of (i.e. reasons for) schedule slippage/extensions, if any;<br />e. Award price and final contract price (award plus growth), including the total number of growth work changes and scope of these changes. <br /><br />Past Performance will look at relevant experience, responsiveness, resources, quality and consistency of services, customer satisfaction, and management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Price: The total price will be the evaluated price.<br /><br />(a) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />EVALUATION APPROACH</p>
<p>1. An evaluation plan has been established to evaluate the factors set forth below and all proposals shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel in accordance with the plan.</p>
<p>2. The Government will evaluate each proposal strictly in accordance with its content and will not assume that performance will include areas not specified in the offeror's written proposal. The Government reserves the right to contact other government and commercial sources to validate information submitted in a proposal and to assess capability, past performance and responsibility.</p>
<p>3. Proposals, which are unrealistic in terms of price, will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the proposed contract. Such proposals may be rejected as unacceptable without further discussions. In addition, the Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration those proposals as deficient in information as to require a major re-write or revision in order to become acceptable.</p>
<p>4. The technical evaluation factors and other factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award.</p>
<p>5. The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal Revisions. The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures.</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be more advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. For the purpose of this solicitation technical capability and past performance are approximately equal to price.</p>
<p>Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit proposals that will be considered by the agency. Proposals must fully address all Technical Capabilities Factors and Past Performance. No reference to Price shall be included in the Proposal. Proposals must contain the contractor's Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number. Proposals must be received no later than <br />01 MAR, 11:00 A.M. Local California time.

<p><br />OMBUDSMAN NOTICE</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<DESC>BACKGROUND
The mission of the Department of Veterans Administration (VA) is to honor America's Veterans by providing exceptional health care that improves their health and well-being. VA will continue to be the benchmark of excellence and value in health care and benefits by providing exemplary services that are both patient centered and evidence based. 

In accordance with the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010, (Pub. L. No. 111-163), VA is responsible for the development and implementation of a comprehensive National Caregiver Training Program for caregivers that are caring for disabled Veterans. The VA is committed to providing a high quality and easily accessible training program for caregivers to learn how to care for injured Veterans, as well as gain a better understanding of home safety principles, wellness and prevention, legal and financial issues, and caregiver self care. Health care services provided by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) are organized and delivered through 21 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) and 153 Medical Centers.  

SCOPE OF WORK
The Contractor shall provide the resources necessary to accomplish the tasks as described in this PWS.  The Contractor shall based on a proven curriculum foundation, develop, implement and deliver a comprehensive National Caregiver Education and Training Program for family caregivers who have been approved as a provider of personal care services for eligible Veterans as defined under Title I,  1720G(a)(B)(2) of the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010, Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers.  The Contractor shall also develop, implement and deliver a Program of General Caregiver Education for caregivers of covered Veterans as defined under Title I,  1720G(b)(2) Program of General Caregiver Support Services.  

Both programs must support multi-modal methods of delivery (classroom and self-study via workbook/DVD and Web). Training must be capable of reaching caregivers of Veterans residing in both urban and rural areas.  All personnel, materials and services to provide caregiver training will be provided by the Contractor. All aforementioned efforts shall include Contractor participation in stakeholder workgroups and interaction with various customers to help collect requirements and program implementation issues. 

PERFORMANCE DETAILS
The Client anticipates a period of performance of one (1) twelve month base period with four (4) twelve month option periods.  

When delivering the caregiver education programs in a face-to-face formal classroom setting, the training shall be performed between the hours of 8:00 am - 8:00 pm location specific time, Monday through Friday.  When developing the caregiver curriculum, the Contractor shall perform and be available for collaboration between the hours of 8:00 am - 8:00 pm ET.  Any work at Government facilities shall not take place on Federal holidays (see 5 U.S.C.  6103) unless authorized by the CO.  

Tasks associated with the development phase of the National Caregiver Training Program shall be performed at the Contractor's facilities or as otherwise agreed upon by both parties. 
  
The Contractor shall develop and deliver two distinct national caregiver training programs.  The first will serve caregivers of Veterans eligible for the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers; the second will serve caregivers of Veterans covered by the program of general caregiver support services.  Education for both groups is to be accessible by caregivers residing in both urban and rural areas. This task shall be accomplished by providing three (3) delivery methods for the provision of caregiver training: 1) classroom; 2) self-study (via workbook/DVD); and 3) web-based training. For the program of general caregiver support a Train-the-Trainer print curriculum is to be developed.  This product will be used for instructing VAMC staff in the content and manner of presentation of the curriculum to caregivers in the program of general caregiver support.  Classroom-based training will take place onsite at the Contractor's facility or local VAMC if mutually agreed by both parties. Classroom training shall be held a minimum of quarterly at rotating sites within each VISN; class size shall be a maximum of 25 caregivers. Any modifications or request for alternate training location will require advance concurrence by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) or VA Program Manager (PM).

The clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br /><br />(i) Price<br />(ii) Technical Acceptability</p>
<p><strong>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD <br /></strong><br />This is a competitive best value evaluation in which the competing offerors will be ranked by price and then determined technically acceptable (LPTA). Certifications and past performance experience will be evaluated in order to determine if the offeror is technically "acceptable". By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements. Unless explicitly noted in the proposal, all offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br /><br />A. Price Evaluation. Initially offers shall be ranked according to price, including any option prices if applicable. An offeror's quoted prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in attachment 5 by the quoted unit price for each Contract Line Item Number or Subcontract Line Item Number to confirm the extended amount for each. The extended amounts will be added together to determine the total evaluated price. When applicable, the price evaluation adjustment for HUBZone small business concerns will be applied in accordance with FAR 52.219-4, Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for HUBZone Small Business Concerns, to arrive at an evaluated price. The price evaluation will document (for the offers evaluated under paragraph B below) the reasonableness and affordability of the quoted total evaluated price.<br /><br />B. Technical Acceptability. Only the five (5) lowest price offeror's past performance information will be analyzed. This solicitation does not require the submission of a separate technical quote however; maintenance on the digital secured trunking system located on Barksdale AFB must be performed by a factory trained Motorola technician using only genuine Motorola replacement parts in accordance with the warranty. In order to determine technical acceptability, training certificates are required to be included with past performance information. <br /><br />(1)Certificates must indicate training on a Motorola Astro 7.4 Digital Secured Trunking System or higher. Certificates should be submitted for the person who will be performing the actual maintenance. <br /><br />(2) Past performance The five (5) lowest price offerors will be evaluated based on (1) their past performance information submittals and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment as "Go/No Go". The evaluation of the five (5) lowest price offers past performance until an offeror is rated "Go" or until all offerors are evaluated. While the Government evaluation team and the contracting officer will strive for maximum objectivity, the evaluation process, by its nature, is subjective and therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire evaluation process. <br /><br />Relevant past performance includes, but is not limited to, digital trunking system maintenance experience. Recent past performance consists of contracts, completed or in progress, performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers within the last three (3) years from date of issuance of this solicitation. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this RFQ, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. <br />Past performance regarding joint ventures, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major requirements or critical aspects of the requirement will be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "No Go," meaning the rating is treated unfavorably. <br /><br />Past performance data required is: contract number, contract performance period, contract award amount, brief description of effort, and government or private issuing activity point of contract/telephone number. <br /><br />C. The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.<br /><br />(End of provision)<br /><br />THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT ACCEPT INCOMPLETE QUOTES. Offers will be evaluated on the prices as offered. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. If an offer cannot comply with every requirement, then the offer will not be rated as technically acceptable, and therefore will not be considered. Once an offer with the lowest price has been determined to be technically acceptable, and in compliance with all directions in this solicitation, the Government will award to the offeror.<br /><br />Quotes can be faxed (in accordance with FAR provision 52.214-13 TELEGRAPHIC BIDS) to the attention of A1C Jeffery Hairston at (318) 456-3648 no later than 25 Feb 2011 at 12:00pm (CST). Offers received after this date and time will be considered as late submissions in accordance with 52.212-1(f) and will not be evaluated or considered. Please refer any questions to A1C Jeffery D. Hairston, Contract Specialist, at (318) 456-3586, jeffery.hairston@barksdale.af.mil; or Travis A. Sippel, Contracting Officer, at (318) 456-3450.<br /><br />(a) Please submit hard copies to:</p>

<DESC>*** 23 February 2011 ***
<p>Additional questions and responses:</p>
<p>QUESTION: 3.16 I see that a question was answered as to providing impedance match resistors. Do I understand this to mean that we do not need to include signal conditioning beyond that for IEPE sensors? Also, is the VSCS only responsible for taking a voltage input and providing a voltage sensitivity for Charge or voltage-mode sensors?</p>
<p>RESPONSE: No, as 3.16 states the vendor's VSCS must have signal conditioning as required for charge mode (high impedance), low impedance voltage (IEPE), voltage mode accelerometers, and velocity pickups. The charge mode shall determine accelerometers charge sensitivity (pC/g).</p>
<p>QUESTION: 3.8 Will reference sensors of velocity and displacement be used? Or, will the reference standard be an accelerometer?</p>
<p>RESPONSE: The reference standard will be an accelerometer.</p>
<p>QUESTION: 6.5 Is it sufficient to provide the VSCS uncertainties only?</p>
<p>RESPONSE: No, the uncertainty shall be presented as in par 6.0 through 6.5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have another concern that has come up. We've been exploring laptop options and cannot find a laptop that meets the storage temperature range, screen size/resolution and number of USB ports.</p>
<p>The only laptop we've found the following:</p>
<p>1. A Dell e6400 XFR meets temperature but not screen size (14")</p>
<p>2. A standard commercial laptop meeting all specs except storage temperature range (typically -40C to 60C)</p>
<p>3. A Getac rugged laptop meets storage temperature and screen size (only has 2 USB ports and is not a major manufacturer)</p>
<p>4. A desktop computer meeting all specifications (except laptop)</p>
<p>RESPONSE: An exception to the 3.3 Storage Temperature Range is for the laptop which shall have a storage/shipping temperature range of a typical environment of a package shipped via commercial carrier.<br />Also the laptop display panel can be as small as 14".</p>

<DESC>This amendment answers questions that several vendors have asked in response to the combined synopsis solicitation. <BR>"Three (3) Translators, (English, Spanish, Portuguese)"<BR><BR>Question: Please provide as many details as possible about the type of<BR>documents that these translators will be expected to work with. <BR><BR>Answer: Military to Military (predominately) directives/slides/coorespondence pertaining to the UN Peace Keeping Operation simulation going on. <BR><BR> <BR><BR>Question: Please indicate the anticipated daily workload for a translator.<BR>For example, a professional translator can typically translate 2,000 words per day. <BR><BR>Price by hours not by quantity.<BR><BR> <BR><BR>Question: Can you confirm that they will only be required to translate into<BR>their native language? For example, the English translator will be presented with texts written in Spanish and/or Portuguese and will provide a written version of the same in English. <BR><BR>Answer: This is the probable scenerio, cross translation is not mandatory, <BR><BR> <BR><BR>Question:   Do you have examples of materials that will require translation?<BR><BR>Answer: intial docs will be provided approximately one week out for review (if available) translation starts before the conference starts. Generally, slides, memos, and operation type orders (these are generally simulations for the exercise)<BR><BR> <BR><BR>Question:  Do you anticipate the workload being distributed evenly between<BR>the three translators (i.e., there is a similar amount of work for each language combination)?<BR><BR>Answer: The majority is Portugese and English with Spanish being a near third, so similar but impossible to precisely answwer at this time. <BR><BR> <BR><BR>"Three (3) Simultaneous Interpreters"<BR><BR>Question:         It is important to distinguish between consecutive and<BR>simultaneous interpretation. Simultaneous interpreting requires the interpreter to sit in a booth wearing a pair of headphones and speak into a microphone; the interpretation is delivered to the participants via a transmitter. During consecutive interpreting the speaker stops every 1-5 minutes (usually at the end of every "paragraph" or a complete thought) and the interpreter then steps in to render what was said into the target language. Please confirm that what you require for this conference is simultaneous interpreting.<BR><BR>Answer: Yes simultaneous.<BR><BR> <BR><BR>Question:   Professional simultaneous interpreters always work in pairs,<BR>alternating every 30 minutes. However, your requirements stipulate just one interpreter per language. If this project requires simultaneous interpretation (as defined above) into English, Spanish and Portuguese, then we would highly recommend having two interpreters per language. It is unrealistic to expect one simultaneous interpreter to work alone for an 8-hour day.<BR><BR>Answer: The requiring activity does feel that the quantity of interpretation being rendered requires pairs. The previous conference held in Brasilia in November 2010, used only three interpreters.<BR><BR> <BR><BR>Question:   Please provide as much detail as possible about the type of<BR>interpreting to be performed. <BR><BR>Answer: Introductions, executions, and wrap up interpretations. For example: after groups make decisions, they will converge on a conference room to annouce current situations, execution of events that have happended and will happen. <BR><BR> <BR><BR>Equipment<BR><BR> <BR><BR>Question:  The solicitation document stipulates "Two person soundproof booths<BR>as required" - Are you able to specify how many of these booths will be required? Presumably, if there are 3 languages for interpretation, you will need 3 booths for the duration of the conference.<BR><BR>Answer: We require two, as only two persons will speak at anyone time. With at least two two person booths. <BR><BR> <BR><BR>

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR THE PROBEPOSITIONING SYSTEM. Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. Thisnotice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendmentwill not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to the following submitted questions:1) The solicitation indicates that the response date for the RFQ is 3/1/2011 and thedelivery date for the end item is 4/15/2011. If the end item due date is in factaccurate, this would allow less than 6 weeks for the proposals to be reviewed, theproject to be awarded, design of the system developed, ordering of parts, manufacture ofcustom parts, assemble of system, test of system, etc. and the packaging and shipment ofsystem to arrive by the due date. From our experience, the time allocated does not allowsufficient time to adequately complete all of the aforementioned tasks. Is the 4/15/11delivery date correct?The probe positioning system is to be used in an upcoming test in the vacuum chamber. Thetesting is set to begin in May. The April 15 delivery date was to allow installation andcheckout of the system. April 15th is the desired delivery date. If this date cannot bemet, I would recommend submitting whatever lead time you feel confident you can meet.2) There is no reference to the installation of the system. Will the supplier beresponsible to assist in the installation of this system?It is assumed that the system will be shipped as built-up components for assembly byNASA. No assistance from the supplier is required other than instructions and respondingto any issues.3) Is there more information available on the Vacuum Chamber? If so can it be provided?The vacuum chamber is identified as VF5 at NASA GRC. It is a 15 diameter x 60 longcryo-pumped vacuum chamber. The base of the bottom axis of the positioning system willrest on two parallel beams that are 240 inches long and 7 inches wide. The distancebetween the beams (outside-to-outside dimension) is 135 inches. There is only 2 inches ofclearance between the outside of the beam and the facility wall. This drove therequirement of 120 inches of travel for the Y-axis (on top of the X-axis moving along thebeams). It assumed some finite overhang for the Y-axis motor and cabling. If 120 inchescannot be met, close to that would be acceptable.4) Is the Probe Positioning System requirement new? Or is this a re procurement?  If a reprocurement, who was the previous provider?The probe positioning system is new so I do not have any previous information.The due date for receipt of offers is not extended.Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASAAcquisition Internet Service (NAIS) February 15, 2011 Documents related to thisprocurement are available over the Internet.

FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, are being utilized for this acquisition. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-48.
<p>Offerors will be responsible for obtaining related amendments to this solicitation, if any, from www.fbo.gov. It is the responsibility of each potential offeror to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to this solicitation. Any communications regarding this acquisition must be made in writing and forwarded via email to Divya Soni at divya.soni@nist.gov and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 511210. This requirement is being competed as a small business set-aside whereby Oracle-authorized resellers/business partners will be the potential offeror base.</p>
<p>APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES FOR THIS SOLICITATION:<br />The Following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation:<br />FAR 52.212-1; FAR 52.212-3; FAR 52.212-4; FAR 52.212-5, including 52.222-50, 52.233-3, and 52.233-4 in paragraph (a)(1), and the following fill-ins in paragraph (b): 52.222-3; 52.222-19; 52.222-21; 52.222-26; 52.222-36; 52.225-13; 52.232-33. All provisions and clauses can be viewed at http://acquisition.gov/comp/far/index.html.<br /><br />Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, does not apply to this acquisition because this is support for a database that has already been purchased previously.</p>
<p>The Office of Information Systems Management (OISM) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has centralized its database management system onto the Oracle Database Management System (DBMS). Consolidation onto the Oracle DBMS platform is consistent with the NIST Technology Reference Manual (TRM). Inclusion in the TRM as a preferred technology indicates that the Oracle DBMS drives technology choices by total business worth by providing optimal support for the NIST mission. All of NIST's enterprise-level databases are centralized on the Oracle DBMS. Oracle is also mandated by the Commerce Business Systems (CBS) application and, by association, the DoC. This procurement is for licenses and support renewal for NIST's existing Oracle database. This requirement consists of the Contract Line Items in the attached RFQ. Quotations shall be tailored to the exact items listed. See attached RFQ for details.</p>
<p>BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:<br />The Office of Information Systems Management (OISM) at NIST has already purchased and is using the Oracle DBMS. The Oracle DBMS is a proprietary application that only Oracle and/or authorized resellers can provide software patches and support for. Only the developer has access to proprietary code to provide the level of support requested.</p>
<p>All responsible offerors that are small businesses and Oracle-authorized resellers/business partners are invited to submit quotations in accordance with the instructions below. <br /><br />ADDENDUM TO PROVISION 52.212-1 - QUOTATION SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS <br />Paragraph (b) below replaces paragraph (b) in provision 52.212-1.<br />(b) Submission of quotations. Submit signed and dated quotations to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Quotations may be submitted on company letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, quotations must include- <br />(1) The solicitation number; <br />(2) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror; <br />(3) Technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with requirements in the solicitation. Item MUST meet exact specifications as laid out in the description attached. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;<br />(4) Terms of any expressed warranty;<br />(5) Firm-fixed price for each CLIN and discount terms;<br />(6) Acknowledgement of solicitation amendment(s);<br />(7) Include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Quotations that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>NIST reserves the right to award a purchase order without discussions, based solely on the submission of the Contractor.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: The award will be made to the responsible authorized offeror whose technically acceptable quotation is deemed to represent the lowest price. Offers that meet all of the attached minimum requirements will be deemed technically acceptable.</p>

<p>If multiple organizations are participating, one signature from the principal/leading organization is acceptable.<br />&emsp;<br />6. Add paragraph VII.C.3.g as follows:</p>
<p>"g. Export Control: Potential offerors are reminded this BAA seeks unclassified technology solutions and that white papers may be shared with foreign government personnel from either the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland or the Government of Australia. As required by paragraph VIII.B.9 above, white paper submissions are to identify any items that are potentially export-controlled; such that dissemination to these foreign government personnel may be inhibited by United States federal laws, rules, or regulations."</p>
<p><br />7. Replace paragraph IX.B.2.f with the following paragraph:</p>
<p>"f. Proprietary or Export Control Marking. Offerors are expected to appropriately mark proprietary and/or export controlled information contained in the proprosal. For additional information regarding export controlled information, refer to paragraph IX.C.1.r below.</p>
<p><br />8. Renumber paragraph the current paragraph "IX.C.1.r" to "IX.C.1.s" and insert the following new paragraph IX.C.1.r:</p>
<p>"r. Export Control: Potential offerors are reminded this BAA seeks unclassified technology solutions and that proposals may be shared with foreign government personnel from either the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland or the Government of Australia. As required by paragraph IX.B.2.f above, proposal submissions are to identify any items that are potentially export-controlled; such that dissemination to these foreign government personnel may be inhibited by United States federal laws, rules, or regulations."</p>
<p><br />9 Add the following to paragraph IX.D.6:</p>
<p>"In addition, foreign government personnel from either the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland or the Government of Australia, participating as outlined in paragraph I.E above, are bound by the non-disclosure provisions covering the protection of "business confidential" information, as stated in their international agreements with the DHS and are not be permitted to release any information to third parties, including others in their organization. By submission of a white paper and/or subsequent proposal, offerors are hereby consenting access to financial, confidential, proprietary, and/or trade secret marked information in the white paper and/or subsequent proposal to these foreign government personnel. To review these two international agreements, see the section titled, "Cooperation in Homeland/Civil Security Matters" at the following link: http://www.dhs.gov/files/international/counterterrorism.shtm."</p>

<p><br />Add the following full text clauses to Appendix B, Applicable Provisions and Clauses:</p>
<p>"CONTRACT AWARDS BY AGENCIES OTHER THAN DHS (using potential DFARS clauses)</p>
<p>DHS/S&amp;T has issued this BAA and shall evaluate White Papers and Full Proposals in accordance with the solicitation's terms and conditions. That said, potential offerors are put on notice that the DHS may elect to have other United States' federal agencies negotiate and ultimately award funding instruments under this BAA (which DHS/S&amp;T evaluated and selected for negotiation). These other federal entities may include the: Department of Interior - National Business Center; Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), and/or Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR). Consequently, resultant funding instruments may deviate from the anticipated FAR clauses noted immediately above by substituting applicable Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) clauses.</p>

<p>Under this BAA and as authorized by 6 U.S.C. &sect; 195c, a resultant award may be jointly-funded by the DHS and either the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland or the Government of Australia. If jointly-funded, pursuant to those countries' international agreements with the DHS, certain contractual provisions must be included in the resultant funding instrument(s). Specifically, as required by both international agreements, their Article Ten, Contracting, indicates:</p>
<p>DHS shall ensure suitable provisions to satisfy the requirements of Article 12 (Information Security), Article 13 (Intellectual Property Management and Use of Information), Article 14 (Publication of Research Results) and Article 17 (Third Party Sales and Transfers) are inserted into contracts awarded under this BAA, as well as have them require subcontracting flow-down of said provisions.

Does this need to be applied to all drives, or just for the Master pre-duplication?<BR><BR>ANSWER (4):  You may provide information on how your system handles that process in your response.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) is performing a market survey for the purpose of gathering information pertaining to industry&rsquo;s capability in the field of countering Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). The purpose of this exercise is to obtain a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) price indication of Remotely Controlled Vehicles (RCVs) for future requirements in the forthcoming months. <br /><strong><br />Please note:</strong> <strong>The due date for industry's response to the market survey has been extended to 11 March 2011.</strong> NC3A&rsquo;s point of contact for this exercise is Rebecca Benson, Senior Contracting Officer. Ms. Benson may be reached via email: Rebecca.Benson@nc3a.nato.int OR via phone: +32-(0)-2-707-8328. <br /><br />NC3A is interested in RCVs for use in operations countering IEDs. There are two main application areas in which NC3A may have requirements: 1) IED Detection and Neutralization during Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) operations and 2) Route Clearance Activities. The equipment will be used by military staff from the NATO nations during operations in peace and wartime, under a broad range of climatic conditions. The equipment shall provide the operating forces with the capability to investigate, manipulate, and disrupt suspected IEDs in a variety of situations and environments, using the RCV with equipment payload. <br /><br />The requirements are fairly wide, with the intention of guiding the company&rsquo;s choice of products to offer so as to provide NC3A with a set of options for RCVs and payloads for use against IEDs in the application areas of interest. Such acquisition, which is envisioned to be conducted on the basis of a competitive exercise, remains subject to the formal approval of the competent NATO authorities, which at this junction has not been granted. At this stage, therefore, NC3A cannot guarantee that such a competitive exercise will be carried out, and it reserves the right to pursue other acquisition avenues at its disposal. To this extent it shall be noted that should a competitive exercise be pursued for the purpose of the procurement of the RCVs, it shall be conducted in such a way as to not limit or otherwise render unfeasible the adoptions or specific solutions to the disadvantage of companies that have not participated in this survey. <br /><br />Any response to this request is to be provided purely on a voluntary basis, and the determination not to provide feedback shall not constitute grounds for the exclusion of companies from any form of competitive exercise to be conducted in the future. Furthermore, NC3A shall not recognize any compensation, regardless of its nature, for activities performed in conjunction with the present request. The present request and any information provided, including but not limited to pricing, quantities, capabilities, functionalities, and requirements are not to be construed as binding for NATO for future acquisitions of any RCVs. Similarly, any information provided by the company in response to the present request shall be kept confidential, shall be disseminated to NATO personnel only and solely for purposes of the present exercise, and shall not be considered biding with regards to the future potential acquisition of the RCVs in question. <br /><br />ROM Pricing and Data Submission Methodology <br /><br />Methodology <br /><br />Companies are requested to provide per unit price information. A number of questions must also be answered. The responses provided by companies will be treated as commercial-in-confidence, and will only be used for the purpose of defining a funding envelope for projects intending to procure such vehicles and not selecting a product. Product selection will be done through the procurement process. <br /><br />Overview <br /><br />NC3A is interested in RCVs for use in operations countering IEDs. There are two main application areas where NC3A may have requirements in the upcoming months: 1) IED Detection and Neutralization during EOD operations and 2) Route Clearance Activities. The equipment will be used by military staff from the NATO nations during operations in peace and wartime, under a broad range of climatic conditions. The equipment shall provide the operating forces with the capability to investigate, manipulate, and disrupt suspected IEDs in a variety of situations and environments, using the RCV with equipment payload. <br />The requirements are fairly wide, with the intention of guiding the company&rsquo;s choice of products to offer in order to provide NC3A with a set of options for RCVs and payloads for use against IEDs in the application areas of interest. <br /><br />Technical requirements <br /><br />&bull; Physical form: The RCV should be small and light enough to be transported and deployed from a typical SUV-size vehicle. <br />&bull; Mission life: The RCV should be capable of a typical mission life of four hours without recharging. <br />&bull; Terrain handling: The RCV should be capable of on-road use, off-road use, and use within buildings, including the capability to climb stairs. <br />&bull; Environmental: The RCV should be capable of operations in a broad range of environmental conditions, including desert conditions, snow, ice and rain. <br />&bull; Speed: The control of speed should be variable, to allow both fast road use and precise control in closed or unstable physical conditions. In on-road or smooth off-road conditions, the RCV should be capable of maintaining pace with dismounted solders. <br />&bull; Remote control: The RCV should be capable of being controlled out of direct line of sight of the operator, e.g., within a building. The control link should be selectable as wireless or physical (e.g., fiber optic). <br />&bull; Payload: The RCV should be capable of operating with a range of payload configurations, including mixes of sensors (e.g., visible, IR, X-ray, microphones) and physical actuators (e.g., robotic arm, shotgun, vehicle entry devices). These should all be controlled by the operator and sensor data related in real time to the operator via the remote link. <br />&bull; Payload maneuvering: The RCV should be capable of fine control of the pointing of payloads through precise control of the RCV itself (e.g., turning on the spot), control of the RCV stance, and/or fine control of payloads on extendable or robotic arms. <br />&bull; Traction: The RCV should be capable of towing/pushing large objects, e.g., vehicles. <br />&bull; Robustness: Although the RCV is expendable in the case of unintended IED detonation, the RCV should be robust and protected against typical operational use of, for example, ballistic payloads. <br /><br />Information Required <br /><br />1) The scope of the solution: <br /><br />Please provide the following information based upon the requirements described above: a) Indicate whether you would be able to provide a complete solution for both application areas: EOD Operations and Route Clearance Activities. b) Provide details of your products that fulfill part of the requirements, meet the requirements, or exceed the requirements.

Product selection will be done through the procurement process. <br /><br />Overview <br /><br />NC3A is interested in stand-off detection equipment to detect explosives and weapons (generically referred to as anomalies) concealed under clothing on personnel attempting to enter secure compounds via an Entry Control Point (ECP). NC3A may have requirements for this type of equipment in the upcoming months and is primarily interested in the following sensor technologies: 1) millimeter wave imaging systems and 2) radar based systems. The equipment will be used by military staff from the NATO nations during operations in peace and wartime, under a broad range of climatic conditions. <br /><br />The requirements stated below are fairly wide, with the intention of guiding the company&rsquo;s choice of products to offer so as to provide NC3A with a set of options for stand-off detection equipment at a typical ECP. A typical operational scenario can be described as follows: <br /><br />&bull; The entry conditions are controlled such that entering personnel can be scanned individually while walking or stopped for scanning if required. <br />&bull; The scanning must take place with a stand-off from own forces and the scanning equipment. <br />&bull; The scanning area will typically be outside (in the open); however, blast protection blocks and light roof cover may be used to partially enclose the scanning area. <br /><br />Technical requirements <br /><br />&bull; Mission time: 24 hours per day continuous use. <br />&bull; Throughput: Six people per minute per entry channel. <br />&bull; Stand-off distance: in excess of 5m, desirably 50m. <br />&bull; Detection Capability: The materials to be detected include explosives, weapons, and ceramics concealed under clothing of the entering personnel. It is desirable that detection occur automatically (without operator intervention) and that the anomalies detected can be discriminated by material type. The automated localization of the position of the anomalies on the body is of significant importance.<br />&bull; Scanning capabilities: For imaging sensors, real time video rate scanning is desirable. <br />&bull; Safety: The system emission levels shall be within safe limits for both operating personnel and personnel being scanned. <br />&bull; Operation &amp; Control: The sensors must be capable of remote operation together with remote display of images, video, and results from sensors. Automatic detection and discrimination results should also be displayed to cue operator action. Recording of sensor data is also required. <br />&bull; Target set: The system shall be able to detect metallic and non-metallic objects hidden under regular clothing. The size and composition of the threats to be detected shall range from coins and cell phones to suicide vests. <br />&bull; Countermeasures: The system must employ countermeasure techniques (e.g., filtering, data processing, etc.) in order to reduce the effect of potential jamming and camouflage. <br /><br />Information Required <br /><br />1) The scope of the solution: Please provide the following information based upon the requirements described above: a) Indicate whether you would be able to provide solutions for both sensor types: millimeter wave and radar based. b) Provide details of your products that fulfill part of the requirements, meet the requirements, or exceed the requirements.

<CONTACT>Steven Santoro
<DESC>BLM Request for Proposals, L11PS00054, TECHNICAL REVIEW OF THE WILD HORSE AND BURRO PROGRAM. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), National Operations Center (NOC) intends to award a sole source contract to National Academy of Sciences, Office of Contracts & Grants, 500 Fifth Street, NW, Washington, DC 20001 for the continuation of a study of the science, methodology, and technical decision-making approaches of the Wild Horse and Burro Program.  In evaluating the program, the study will build on findings of three prior reports prepared by the National Research Council (NRC) in 1980, 1982, and 1991 and summarize additional, relevant research completed since the three earlier reports were prepared.  Section 1333 of the 1971 Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act (WFRHBA) provides the BLM with the authority to consult with individuals independent of Federal and State government who have been recommended by the National Academy of Sciences, and other individuals determined to have scientific expertise and special knowledge of WH&B protection, wildlife management and animal husbandry as related to rangeland management.  The success of any strategy the BLM develops hinges on our ability to bridge the many divergent and conflicting perspectives about how the Wild Horse and Burro Program should be managed in the West.  These differences have led to an increasing number of appeals, litigation, congressional inquiries, and Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.  Many feel the BLM is not credible and does not apply the best science in managing Americas Wild Horse & Burro Program.  The recommendations that the NAS provides would benefit the BLM as we continue to work closely with Congress, the public and our stakeholders to identify strategies for the future management of the Wild Horse and Burro Program in the West that enjoy broad-based support.
A cost-type contract is anticipated, with a delivery date of the final published report of no later than twenty-four months after award of a contract.  The contractor must gather data and provide reports that will address the following key scientific challenges:  Estimates of the WH&B populations; Population Modeling; Genetic diversity in Wild Horse and Burro herds; Annual rates of WH&B population growth; Predator impact on Wild Horse and Burro population growth; Population control; Immunocontraception of wild horse mares (porcine zona pellucida);   Managing a portion of a population as non-reproducing; AML Establishment or Adjustment; Societal Considerations; and Additional Research Needs. 
All responsible sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by the BLM. Send information for technical evaluation to Steve Santoro at (303) 236-3518 by March 24, 2011.  See Note 22.

<DESC>As stated during the Hybrid Electric Drive Industry Day held November 17, 2010, NAVSEA is hosting a second Industry Day to introduce a revised draft RFP and draft specification reflecting updated Navy requirements and feedback from industry. Also included will be an opportunity to view the Navys Land Based Engineering Site (LBES) where HED EPS will be evaluated prior to ship installation and where the HED EPS Proof of Concept (PoC) system will be tested.  The Navy continues to be interested in feedback on the draft solicitation and technical performance specification in areas that would drive cost, increase schedule or otherwise add requirements, all of which potentially could be eliminated without detrimental impact to in-service performance.
 As this is not a solicitation, no attendee firm should view this as an opportunity to exhibit its qualifications or technical merit that distinguish itself from others in attendance. Questions and conversation that appear to steer in this direction will be discouraged.

Please limit attendance from each company to four individuals as the total attendance will be limited. Attendance for the facility tour is very limited so only two individuals from any interested company will be permitted, up to the limit of the group size allowed, on a first-come-first-served basis.  Attendees must be US Citizens or Permanent Resident Aliens and must represent bona fide US Department of Defense (DoD) contractors as the presentation materials may include limited distribution information.
  Evidence in the form of an executed DD Form 2345 (MILITARILY CRITICAL TECHNICAL DATA AGREEMENT) will be required prior to admission. Please pre-register via email to the following address: joseph.tannenbaum@navy.mil no later than Tuesday March 1, 2011. Registration will be confirmed via a responding e-mail and failure to register will prohibit admittance.  Please provide the individuals name, company, phone and e-mail address in addition to the DD 2345 (reference to DD 2345 submitted for the November 17, 2010 Industry Day may be accepted in lieu of a new form).  In addition to the requirement to pre-register, there are access requirements to gain access to the Naval Surface Warfare Center contained on the attached document that must be followed or access will be denied.
  Questions about these access requirements can be addressed to joseph.tannenbaum@navy.mil.  The Government intends to publish a list of attendees to encourage subcontracting opportunities.  Note: This is NOT a "bidders conference" and this announcement is not a contract, request for proposal, a promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind that would otherwise obligate the Government. The Government will not assume liability for costs incurred by any offeror for travel, presentations, marketing efforts or data offered for examination; therefore the cost of preparing information in response to this notice is not considered an allowable direct charge to the Government.

Date: Wednesday, March 9, 2011

Time: Check-in at 9:30am; General Session from 10:00am to 3:00pm; Facility Tour from 4:00pm to 6:00pm.

Location: Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division (NSWCCD), Building 77L, Melville Conference Room, Philadelphia Naval Business Center, Philadelphia PA 19112.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to notify all interested parties that the anticipated Request For Proposal release date has changed.&nbsp; The RFQ is anticipated to be issued on or about March 9, 2011.&nbsp; The RFP will be posted at:<br /><a href="http://www.epa.gov/oam/regions/index.htm">www.epa.gov/oam/regions/index.htm</a>.<br /><br />This requirement is being set aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Businesses. NIACS code 562910 is applicable for this procurement of professional, administrative and management support services in support of EPA in its mission of oversight and enforcement of both Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) activities at active, closing, or former Federal facilities, including Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) installations, Formerly Used Defense Sites (FUDS), and Formerly Used Site Remedial Action Program (FUSRAPP) sites.

<p>These services shall be performed for multiple locations within EPA Region 7 (Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska). Cross-over work to other EPA Regions is possible. EPA anticipates issuing an ID/IQ fixed labor rate contract with performance incentives and disincentives for these services. Estimated dollar value for this contract (if all options and incentives are earned) is $3,500,000 to $5,000,000.</p>
