THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS.
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology. Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals. <br /><br />The purpose of this modification is to fund the contractor to collect and subsequently enter necessary data into the HITECH FISS screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals by March 31, 2011. <br />This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</p>

<p>Title: Liquid Handler for High Capacity Prep Liquid Chromatography</p>
<p>THIS IS A SOLE / SINGLE SOURCE, NON-COMPETITIVE NOTICE. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. This sole / single source, non-competitive notice is prepared in accordance FAR Parts 5 and 13. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. FAR Part 6 - Competition Requirements, is not applicable to contracts awarded using the simplified acquisition procedures of FAR Part 13, not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<p>This announcement constitutes the only notice; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>The resultant acquisition will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular, FAC 05-48.</p>
<p>The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System code 334516, with size standard of 500 Employees.</p>
<p>Market Research conducted by the Government in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 10, Market Research, has determined that the sole / single source reference, is currently the only company that can provide the services / items specified herein.</p>
<p>THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), for the NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source noncompetitive basis to Gilson, Inc. 3000 Parmenter Street, Middleton, WI 53562-1617, to provide a liquid handler for high capacity prep liquid chromatography. <br /><br />The sole source determination is based upon the fact that Gilson's liquid handler is the only equipment on the market that will operate under the proprietary Gilson Software; Gilson is the only manufacturer which uses this software. NCGC currently owns the pump and the detector which uses the Gilson Software and any other software will be incompatible with the existing equipment. Parts and accessories must also be compatible with existing equipment.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this requirement is to apply the tools of small molecule screening and discovery to the development of chemical probe research tools, for use in the study of protein and cell functions, and biological processes relevant to physiology and disease. In this research, the biological utility of small molecules is assessed; this is prepared in NCGC's laboratory. This determination relies on the purity and correct identity of the compound of interest. The NIH Chemical Genomics Center, is engaged in various research activities, including, but not limited to, high-throughput screening, parallel synthesis, assay optimization and bioconjugate preparation.</p>
<p>The Gilson Liquid Handler is an integral part of the purification instrumentation, as it is both an injector and a fraction collector. When integrated into existing equipment, it draws the sample into the system. After the sample flows through the system, this same piece of equipment collects the pure sample into individual test tubes. What is needed to assess, are the biological utility of small molecules, prepared in the laboratory. Most every experiment done in the lab requires solvent for synthesis and purification, specifically HPLC purification where a high volume of fractions containing purified sample are produced. The equipment requested will increase the current capacity of the lab; so it is possible to purify more samples in a shorter period of time. The increasing number of chemists in NCGC's group synthesizing, require additional equipment to meet the demand of increasing number of target molecules being produced. This is a unique piece of instrumentation, and is a needed piece of equipment to expand the current Gilson system already in use.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement. Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-CSB-(HG)-2011-065-CRS, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, COAC Services Branch. Responses may be submitted in writing to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute 6701 Rockledge Drive, RLKG Bldg 2, Room 6150B, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, Attention: Caitlin Savina. Emails will also be accepted at caitlin.savina@nih.gov.</p>

The sole source determination is based on the fact that the Laboratory of Molecular Machines and Tissue Architecture is focus on understanding how minute changes in a single protein can alter the development of whole tissue. These effects manifest through defective protein-protein interactions and impaired dynamics and function of protein complexes. The major method used by the LMMTA is high-resolution live single-cell and whole-tissue imaging.  Our experiments require highly complex microscope setups that allow for the precise control of the environment.  This Nikon Ti-E is the most essential component of my laboratory setup. This microscope body with all its components and attachments is unique because it affords a highly stabilized platform with anti vibration properties that accurate at the nanometer scale.  Specifically, this Nikon microscope employs the Perfect Focus system that is unique among competing manufacturers in that a defined image plane can be maintained at all times regardless of any undesired shift in focus.  This system is critical for the success of our experiments, and thus the success of our research program.  The above parts are compatible with the existing system.  The system was purchase under GSA contract #GS24F-1333C, and the National Institutes of Health contract #HHSN268200800087.  Therefore, it is in the Governments best interest to purchase the item from the manufacturer.

<DESC>The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain maintenance and operational support services for an estimated 100 U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) application systems and information technology (IT) environments, as well as modernization support and documentation support through fiscal year (FY) 2021 at an estimated cost of $237 million.&nbsp; A previous sources sought notice was posted to <a href="http://www.fbo.gov">www.fbo.gov</a> for this acquisition (<a href="https://www.fbo.gov/spg/NRC/OA/DCPM/NRC-10-303-MOM/listing.html">https://www.fbo.gov/spg/NRC/OA/DCPM/NRC-10-303-MOM/listing.html</a>), and the results of the Government's analysis of that sources sought notice have been considered in developing the acquisition strategy for this acquisition.<br /><br />This acquisition is a follow-on to the current "Maintenance and Operational Support of NRC Application Systems" contract, for which the incumbent contractor is OAO Corporation; the incumbent contract number is DR-33-07-358 and related task orders.&nbsp; That contract expires on March 25, 2011 but has two additional six-month options to extend the term of the contract.<br /><br />The 10-year period of performance for this new acquisition provides 7 years for the modernization and maintenance of NRC's applications portfolio pulus up to 3 years of contractor award terms that are tied to contractor performance.<br /><br />This acquisition is intended to be a multiple award, partial small business set-aside acquisition along functional area lines (some functional areas will be full and open competition, and others will be small business set-aside) that will result in award of multiple indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity&nbsp;(IDIQ) contracts&nbsp;under which firm-fixed-price, labor-hour or time-and-materials task orders may be negotiated and awarded.<br /><br />Unrestricted Full and Open Competition (F&amp;OC) functional areas in the solicitation will include:<br /><br />&nbsp;- Initial maintenance of legacy systems<br /><br />&nbsp;- Centralized environment support<br /><br />&nbsp;- Requirements and Design<br /><br />Note: Based on information currently available, it is estimated that the value of thes&nbsp;F&amp;OC&nbsp;services is approximately $97 million.<br /><br /><br />Small Business Set-Aside (SBSA) functional areas in the solicitaiton will include:<br /><br />&nbsp;- Legacy modernization and new software application development<br /><br />&nbsp;- Maintenance of modernized systems<br /><br />Note: Based on information currently available, it is estimated that the value of the SBSA services is approximately $140 million.<br /><br /><br />The evaluation factors for the non-set aside portion of the acquisition will include a Subcontracting Plan Evaluation Factor, which incentivizes offerors that are not smsmall businesses.&nbsp; The acquisition will also include an "on-ramp/off-ramp" feature that provides flexibility in managing the agency's future requirements.&nbsp; NRC anticipates a single solicitation that will utilize&nbsp;a best value tradeoff source selection process for each of the functional areas identified above.&nbsp; This process will result in the award of multiple IDIQ contracts for all functional areas.&nbsp; The NRC anticipates cost/price and non-cost/price factors to be approximately equal in importance for each&nbsp;functional area when evaluating offers and selecting awardee(s) for those functional areas.<br /><br />After IDIQ contracts are awarded,&nbsp;individual requirements in those functional areas (except for Centralized Environment Support, wihich is intended to have only one awardee) will be competed among the awardees in those functional areas, with the result being a task order award based on that competition.&nbsp; The multiple-award, partial small business set-aside strategy will facilitate competition and maximize opportunities for small businesses over the potential 10-year contract period.&nbsp; <br /><br />It is expected as the legacy systems are retired over the course of this new acquisition, the need for services under the unrestricted full and open competition areas will decrease.&nbsp; In addition, over time, as NRC modernizes its systems, the need for legacy modernizaiton, software application development and maintenance of modernized systems services in the SBSA functional areas will grow.<br /><br />NRC will consider the question of organizational conflicts of interest (OCOI) for this acquisition, in accordance with NRC Acquisition Regulation (NRCAR) Subpart 2009.5, and will ensure compliance with OCOI requirements with regard to placement of resulting contract awards.<br /><br />The solicitation and related amendments will only be made available from this web site.&nbsp; Therefore, potential offerors are encouraged to monitor <a href="http://www.fbo.gov">www.fbo.gov</a> for information or amendments relating to this solicitation.&nbsp; The NRC currently anticipates posting the solicitation on or about January 31, with proposals due by the response date indicated in this notice.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This acquisition is being solicited as an unrestricted requirement.  The standard classification NAICS code 541712. <BR><BR>The requirement will include a one year period of performance with two one year options.<BR><BR><BR>DESCRIPTION:  The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) has a requirement for the following:<BR><BR>The purpose of this requirement is to provide proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiling of target host proteins that are significantly affected during infection with bacterial or viral pathogens, and to perform the functional characterization of select host targets that are identified. The pathogens of interest for the study include Yersinia pestis and hemorrhagic fever causing viruses such as Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV). <BR><BR>The contractor shall perform the required services in 4 phases as outlined below: <BR><BR>(1) Preparation of samples with assistance from USAMRIID personnel and performing QC.<BR><BR>(2) Performance of proteomic analyses using mass spectrometry and antibody-based methods. <BR><BR>(3) Analysis of the collected data to verify discovered hits and identify protein networks of interest <BR><BR>(4) Performing follow-up functional assays to test the host targets of interest for future therapeutic approaches.  Ten target genes, or the number selected in consultation with USAMRIID, will be analyzed. <BR><BR>USAMRIID will provide samples for analysis and perform the necessary in vitro and cell-based assays when required. USAMRIID will also perform microscopy, immunological, and other assays to verify the integrity and efficacy of the samples. USAMRIID will provide recommendations on all 4 phases of the work that are indicated above, including the development of proteomic and phosphoproteomic methods, data analysis, and the development of appropriate functional assays to analyze identified targets, to ensure that the final findings will meet mission needs for future development of effective and FDA-licensable therapeutics. <BR><BR>1.	Sample preparation and quality control. <BR>Control and infected protein samples will be prepared as necessary and quantified for use in quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) and phsophosite-specific antibody screening. Integrity of the samples will be verified by gel analysis before use in experiments. <BR><BR>2.	Proteomic and phosphoproteomic approaches.<BR>The contractor will perform quantitative MS and antibody screening of the protein samples. For quantitative MS studies, standard protocols will be used for trypsin digestion of the proteins, post-digestion labeling of the peptides, and TiO2 purification (or other mutually agreed upon method) of phosphopeptides for phosphoproteomic analysis. The MS instruments available to the contractor (such as 2-Thermo LTQ MS instruments with ETD and a LTQ OrbiTrap High Resolution Mass spectrometer or any other MS with the same resolution) will be used for completing the MS work.<BR><BR>3.	Data analysis.<BR>The contractor will perform software analysis of the collected MS data using appropriate analysis software such as TurboSEQUEST (or any other similar software), and will manually verify the MS hits thus identified. The contractor will compile the information obtained from the antibody screen to identify significant hits of interest and will cross reference with the MS list in search of any orthogonal convergence for the two data sets. The contractor will also perform protein network analysis of the data sets using appropriate software such as the Ingenuity Platform Analysis (IPA) software.<BR><BR>4.	Functional analysis.   <BR>The contractor will perform appropriate functional analyses for selected significant hits of interest using the facilities available to the contractor and, when appropriate and required, the facilities at USAMRIID. Depending on the target of interest and availability of appropriate reagents, follow-up Western analysis, and if necessary the purification of the target protein will be performed for specific in vitro tests.<BR><BR>Option Years<BR><BR>As required by the government, two option years may be exercised to perform the following the following tasks:  <BR>Option Year 1:<BR>1.	Optimization and application of siRNA knockdown screening to test the functional effects of at least 10 and not more than 25 target genes.  The number of targets selected will be based on a consultation with USAMRIID. <BR><BR>2.	Optimization and application of non-cell based in vitro inhibitor studies for at least 10 identified target genes (or determined in consultation with USAMRIID) with known signaling or enzymatic functions that can be purified and for which inhibitors are available. In cases needed, purifications must be performed.<BR><BR>Option Year 2:<BR><BR>1.	Optimization and application of cell-based inhibitor studies for at least 10 identified target genes (or determined in consultation with USAMRIID) with known signaling or enzymatic functions for which inhibitors are available.<BR><BR>2.	Performance of time course studies aimed at determining the time window during which the function of a specific target gene is important for infection. At least 10 selected target genes will be tested, or the number that is determined by consultation with USAMRIID.<BR>	<BR><BR>All responsible sources may submit a quote, which shall be considered by the agency.  The competitive solicitation, solicitation amendments and all questions and answers relating to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/ or https://www.fedbizopps.gov.<BR>  <BR>The solicitation is anticipated for release to the vendor community on or about, January 10, 2011, and will only be available until February 24, 2011.

<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquistion Activity (USAMRAA), Fort Detrick, MD  intends to issue a sole source award utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures to FD NeuroTechnologies, PO Box 785, Ellicott City, MD  21041 for services to histologically process brain tissues from rats.  FD NeuroTechnologies has processed tissue in the past and utilizing this contractor's proprietary silver stain represents the continuation of an ongoing series of studies to evaluate blast-induced brain injury.  The tissue should be identically processed and presented as previous tissue to most effectively integrate the overall neuroanatomical assessments and data collection.  For the most direct, meaningful comparisons, it is essential that brain tissue specimens be prepared in an identical manner.  This contractor is the only one with the silver strain that was used in previous studies to detect dead axons and dendrites, and FluoroJade B to detect dying neurons.  This notice of intent is for information purposes only, therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement.  All sources eligible to provide this service must respond in writing. Responses must be supported with clear and convincing evidence to clearly be able to provide services outlined above.  A request for documentation will not be considered as an affirmative response.  If no responses are received, within 15 days after publication of this notice, to the effect that comparable services are available, and that it is more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these services through a sole-source contract, then a sole source acquisition award will be made.  Response to this award is to be sent to wanda.harper@amedd.army.mil.<BR><BR>

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is interested in expanding its temporary sheltering operational capability to improve assistance to disaster survivors during major and catastrophic events. The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to seek industry input regarding innovative, temporarily placed congregate and non-congregate shelter units.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Units could provide separate sleeping quarters for individual households with common services or contain multiple households in a single facility.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We are considering all types of materials and designs but primarily those that can be connected to an HVAC system and can resist inclement weather conditions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Structures must be able to be assembled quickly by unskilled labor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>During an initial disaster response, when requested by an affected State, FEMA provides mass care support to disaster survivors in congregate and non-congregate shelters. When Federal and State programs are not capable of identifying sufficient or alternate accommodations (such as hotels/motels, rental assistance and travel trailers/manufactured housing), FEMA may be asked to provide an alternative solution. Currently, FEMA does not have a mechanism to support States with this type of request. The agency is committed to improve its sheltering capability by identifying innovative options for assisting survivors with temporary solutions for sheltering/housing shortfalls. Solutions should include a range of alternatives, such as erecting small, easily transported and affordable units that can be located in cluster sites and/or on a survivor's private property.</p>

Existing congregate shelters are not sufficient and additional, innovative sheltering solutions are required, as traditional temporary housing has a potentially significant ramp-up time. Cluster sites are established to provide survivor households with units that provide more privacy and stability than a traditional congregate setting, but with lower set-up and space requirements than temporary housing. Wrap-around services to sustain survivors may be provided at cluster sites until temporary or permanent housing can be established.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 19.5pt; mso-pagination: widow-orphan lines-together">&nbsp;</p>

While the home was not destroyed, it requires repairs lasting up to six months before it is habitable. Rather than remaining in a congregate shelter or hotel room, the survivor is provided with a shelter unit on their property, adjacent to their damaged dwelling. This shelter unit allows the homeowner to remain near their home to safeguard their property and oversee repairs. Having this option available will potentially eliminate the need for more expensive traditional temporary housing options that require extensive set-up time. After catastrophic events (depending on various situational factors), wrap around services may be provided on private sites, serviced by volunteer agencies or the local, state, or federal government, to support the needs of disaster survivors.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION NOTICE
<p>This is a Request For Information (RFI) for market research purposes only and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP). A solicitation is not being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.</p>
<p>This RFI is being published to identify industry capabilities and compare the feasibility of obtaining and analyzing nationally representative food purchase data maintained by large store chains, loyalty card companies and/or other commercial sources to determine what types of foods are purchased by participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistant Program (SNAP, formerly known as the Food Stamp Program). <br /><br />The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code proposed for the requirement is 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services. The size standard for NAICS 541611 is $5M. Comments on this NAICS and suggestions for alternatives must include supporting rationale.</p>
<p>1.0 BACKGROUND<br />SNAP helps put food on the table for some 31 million people per month in FY 2009. It provides low-income households with electronic benefits they can use like cash at most grocery stores. SNAP is the cornerstone of the Federal food assistance programs, and provides crucial support to needy households and to those making the transition from welfare to work.<br />The U.S. Department of Agriculture administers SNAP at the Federal level through its Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). State agencies administer the program at State and local levels, including determination of eligibility and allotments, and distribution of benefits.<br />All 50 States have made the transition from paper coupons to the Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card. The EBT card is like a debit card and can be used at USDA-authorized grocery stores across the country. At the cash register, the customer or cashier swipes the EBT card through the card reader at the point of sale and the customer enters a personal identification number to secure the transaction. The system deducts the exact dollar amount of the purchase from the customer's EBT account and deposits it into the retailer's bank account. Once the SNAP EBT transaction is complete, a receipt shows the amount of the SNAP purchase and the amount of SNAP benefits remaining in the EBT account. In June 2004, SNAP completed a transformation from paper coupons to an electronic benefits transfer (EBT) card. Participants receive a plastic EBT card (similar to a bank debit card) with the dollar amount for which they are eligible each month.</p>
<p>The Women, Infants and Children program (WIC) provides Federal grants to States for supplemental foods, health care referrals, and nutrition education for low-income pregnant, breastfeeding, and non-breastfeeding postpartum women, and to infants and children up to age five who are found to be at nutritional risk.</p>
<p>2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>All available evidence indicates that the diets and food choices of most Americans are less than ideal, and that the diets and food choices of low-income individuals are most striking in their similarity rather than their differences with higher income individuals. Concern is frequently expressed that SNAP benefits are spent on unhealthy foods, however, no data exists that identifies the types of foods SNAP recipients purchase with their benefits.</p>
<p>Therefore, this study has three objectives:</p>
<p>1) Identify and compare the feasibility of obtaining and analyzing food purchase data - from large store chains, loyalty card companies and other commercial sources that offer nationally representative information. <br />2) Obtain and examine one or more of these extant data bases to examine the proportion of SNAP benefits spent on different foods. If store sales and EBT transaction data can be linked at the household level, purchase patterns can be examined by benefit amount. <br />3) Explore the feasibility of obtaining and analyzing data on foods purchased by WIC clients.<br />Information obtained from this study can inform policy, nutrition education and environmental initiatives to enhance the food choices of participants.</p>
<p>3.0 SUBMISSION INFORMATION</p>
<p>FNS is seeking information on available data and on firms capable of identifying, obtaining and analyzing food purchase data - from large store chains, loyalty card companies and other commercial sources that offer nationally representative information. Descriptive and multivariate analyses on this data will be required. This data needs to identify, at a minimum down to the product category level, (fruits, vegetables, beverages, baked goods, dairy, snack foods etc.) purchased with SNAP benefits. Information on the generalizabilty of the data, as well as an indication of sample sizes, regional distribution and other data robustness indicators should be discussed.</p>
<p>Interested firms may submit product descriptions or capability statements that demonstrate its ability to perform all elements of the requirement as described in this notice.</p>
<p>All responses must be submitted to david.mugan@fns.usda.gov no later than 4PM Eastern Standard Time, February 15, 2011.</p>
<p>Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this RFI notice is strictly voluntary. Responses will not be returned. No entitlements to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges to the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses, or the Government's use of such information. The information obtained from responses to this notice may be used in the development of an acquisition strategy and future RFP.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE
<p>THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY (NIST) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE</p>
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) under NAICS code, 541712, that have the capability, experience, and expert knowledge in the area of providing technical support to R&amp;D facilities conducting characterization and calibration of a variety of visible and infrared sources and radiometers.</p>
<p>The Optical Technology Div. (OTD) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides the nation with calibration and measurement services in the ultraviolet through infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The OTD requires Contractor support to fulfill its national calibration requirements and to provide measurement technology support to other government agencies and industry.<br />BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The facilities described below in the Optical Technology Division at NIST are used to support a number of programs that are required to continually maintain, characterize, and calibrate a variety of visible and infrared sources and radiometers. These programs are required to provide radiometric calibration support and optical characterization of materials for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Department of Defense (DoD), Missile Defense Agency, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and many of their supporting contractors.</p>
<p>FACILITIES</p>
<p>The Low Background Infrared (LBIR) Facility provides the infrared user community with a calibration base that includes both spectral and broadband measurements in a 20 K background environment. The spectral calibration capability is currently developed in three areas: spectral calibration of low-background infrared detectors, characterization of optical components, and two cryogenic transfer radiometers (BXR and MDXR) used to evaluate highly collimated infrared sources. The broadband measurements are performed for the calibration of blackbodies in radiance mode.</p>
<p>The Optical Properties of Materials (OPM) Facility provides the scientific community with standard reference samples, as well as a service to quantitatively measure optical properties on user supplied samples. The OPM Facility provides this service from UV to Far IR with the use of a variety of dispersive spectrometers and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometers and sources that operate under ambient conditions. For signal detection the facility use a wide range of detectors including those that need to be operated under vacuum-cryogenic conditions. The infrared OPM Facility has established high accuracy infrared reflectance and transmittance capabilities for wavelengths between 1 &micro;m and 18 &micro;m. Near-normal absolute spectral reflectance and transmittance of both specular and diffuse samples can be measured from near ambient to 200 &deg;C using a custom integrating sphere and Fourier transform (FT) spectrometer. Additional capabilities for specular samples include transmittance down to 10 K using an optical cryostat, as well as variable angle transmittance and reflectance using a custom goniometer and polarizers. Special test measurements are performed for both NIST and external customers in government and industry on a wide variety of materials including mirrors, filters, windows, coatings and cavity structures. Emittance and absorptance are obtained indirectly through combining the reflectance and transmittance under identical conditions. The measurement of directional spectral emittance, for sample temperature sup to 1000 &deg;C, can also be performed through comparison of radiance with reference blackbody sources.</p>
<p>To extend the ability to measure OPM to materials that operate under vacuum and cryogenic conditions, NIST is developing a new facility, the Controlled-Background System for Spectroradiometry and Spectrophotometry (CBS3). This facility will contain an evacuated, temperature-controlled infrared test chamber for measuring the optical properties of infrared materials and black body cavities and sources, and for calibrating and characterizing infrared sensors, in the 5 micrometer to 50 micrometer spectral region. This is a key spectral region for environmental satellite sensors for weather and climate monitoring.<br />This facility will also contain a Fourier Transform Spectrometer and associated detectors and optics.</p>
<p>The Advanced Infrared Radiometry and Imaging (AIRI) Facility mission is to establish, maintain, disseminate, and advance radiance-temperature and spectral radiance scales under ambient background conditions for Planckian sources with thermodynamic temperatures below the silver freezing point of 961 &#61616;C. These scales provide traceability to the thermodynamic temperature scale and the International Temperature Scale of 1990 for internal and external customers performing radiance temperature measurements under ambient background conditions above 200 K.</p>
<p>The Spectral Irradiance/Radiance Calibration using Uniform Sources (SIRCUS) Facility is used as a source to transfer optical and near infrared detector standards in an ambient background from primary standard detectors to transfer standards at the Spectral Comparator Facility (SCF). The SIRCUS Facility uses high power laser and linear and non-linear optical devices to create a broadly tunable, monochromatic, high power source. This source is calibrated with an absolute cryogenic radiometer, which in turn calibrates smaller, more portable transfer detector standards which can then be disseminated to the user community.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned Spectral Comparator Facility (SCF), the Radiance and Radiance Temperature (R2T) Facility, and the Remote-Sensing Laboratory (RSL) serve to disseminate the radiometric calibration capabilities facilitated by SIRCUS to customers on a routine basis.</p>
<p>The Aperture Area Measurement Machine (AAMM) Facility provides precision measurements of aperture areas. Aperture area measurement is essential to radiometry and uncertainties in measured aperture area directly affect uncertainties in radiometric calibration activities. The AAMM directly supports a wide variety of programs within OTD as well as missions in other government agencies and private organizations.</p>
<p>The Hyperspectral Image Projector (HIP) facility is under development at NIST to enable electro-optical instruments to be tested with realistic dynamic scenes in which the spectrum of light projected into each spatial pixel can have an independently programmable spectrum. Prototypes are under development that operate over the ultraviolet, visible, infrared wavelength ranges, both for on-site use as well as delivery to other agency customers. The HIP units are calibrated with reference instruments that have a scale based upon the SIRCUS facility.</p>
<p>The Thermal-Infrared Transfer Radiometer (TXR) is portable liquid-nitrogen-cooled radiometer that is calibrated and characterized at a variety of NIST facilities, including the AIRI facility, the Infrared-SIRCUS facility, and, in the future, the CBS3 facility. It is deployed off-site on an as-needed basis to check the black body source scales of industry, other-government-agency, and university facilities involved with radiometric calibrations of infrared instruments.<br />OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide research and service assistance utilizing Government furnished laboratory equipment and facilities in OTD at NIST to accomplish the following general tasks:</p>
<p>a. Operation and maintenance of the Low Background Infrared Facility (LBIR).</p>
<p>b. Operation and maintenance of the Infrared Optical Properties Measurement (OPM) Facility.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND QUOTES WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with Affymetrix.  The NINR IRP labs have been using the Affymetrix system to detect the changes in gene expression and their association with patients symptoms, such as acute inflammation, acute inflammatory pain, and cancer treatment related complications such as radiation therapy-induced fatigue and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. The Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 is one of the most dense whole genome SNP scanning chips.  This product is the latest available and the only compatible whole genome scan with the scanner that already exists in the NINR lab.  We already finished more than 1000 samples with this SNP Array 6.0 and the same set of 1,000,000 SNPs and 1,000,000 copy number variations should be applied for the consistency of the data variables.  There is no alternative assay to replace the SNP Array 6.0 and reaction kits.
The HG U133Plus2.0 and 3 IVT expression system (Affymetrix, Inc) measure changes in global gene expression from human specimens. We have been using this system to detect the changes in gene expression and their association with patients symptoms, such as acute inflammation, acute inflammatory pain, and cancer treatment related complications such as radiation therapy-induced fatigue and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. This system allows us to use only 100 ng of input total RNA to analyze the whole human gene expression. This decreased input material is a huge advantage for our purpose as in clinical studies we are always facing the challenge to get enough specimen from patients.   
 
NINR IRP laboratories have been facilitated with the Affymetrix system to ensure the outcome reliability without technical bias in data acquisition and assessment.

NINR IR continues the use of the Affymetrix system in order to keep studies consistent, and productive.

<a href="mailto:marcus.s.overbay@us.army.mil">PEO STRI Acquisition Center</a>
<DESC>The Government has a requirement for Combat Training Center-Instrumentation System Modernization (CTC-IS MOD).   The CTC-IS MOD effort will provide replacement communication systems, facilities, infrastructure, new training capabilities, and support for each the CTCs  which operate across diverse terrain topographies and RF challenges and include the  Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC), Ft Polk, LA;  National Training Center (NTC), Ft Irwin, CA;  Joint Multinational Readiness Center (JMRC), Hohenfels, Germany.  The Government requires the capability to provide two-way voice and digital communications between exercise controllers in the analysis facilities, the observer controllers in the field, and the training audience to assist in role playing, controlling the exercise, collecting data, providing training feedback, and ensuring the communications environment is reliable, available, and maintainable.  These communications systems will satisfy mobile, tactical engagement simulation and field instrumentation system requirements as well as capabilities to manage, monitor, control, and support execution of training events through voice and data messages sent between the Exercise Control (EXCON), instrumentation and Combat Trainers.  Additionally the requirements include the update of the legacy system coverage and frequency assignments to accommodate training mission needs with newer mature, available technological capabilities. <BR><BR>The Government anticipates that the CTC-IS MOD program requirement will be fulfilled during the 2nd FY 11 quarter.  This requirement was previously announced on the STRIBOP website on 01 July 2010.  A number of changes in the acquisition approach have occurred since that announcement.  Specifically, the Government no longer plans to award up to 3 short-term R&D Firm Fixed Priced (FFP) delivery orders under STOC II for RDT&A and follow-on production options.  The Government approach now plans on a contract vehicle that contains a base period of two years with three one-year option periods.  Additionally, the Government is considering several different contractual approaches to execute program requirements to include: 1) utilizing its STOC II Multiple Award IDIQ contract vehicle to issue a single task order or  2) issuing a solicitation and resultant single award IDIQ contract outside of STOC II.   Regardless of the contract approach taken by the Government, award will be made on a Best Value/Trade-off basis. <BR><BR>Attached to this notice is a draft statement of work for the CTC-IS MOD requirements.  The Government is seeking information from firms who are interested in this requirement, whether as a prime contractor or subcontractor.  Specifically the Government request that firms review the attached draft statement of work and provide feedback to the Government. Structure your responses in the same format as the listed questions.<BR><BR>I.  Your comments, suggestions, and questions regarding the attached statement of work.<BR><BR>II. Capabilities;<BR><BR>1.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS:<BR><BR>This is a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes only, as defined in Federal Acquisition Register (FAR) 15.201e.   This is not a solicitation or request for competitive proposals.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.  No solicitation document exists or is guaranteed to be issued as a result of this RFI.  Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted.  (Note: this RFI is separate from the previously released Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Medical Countermeasures Prime Systems RFI, W9113M-RFI-090001.  Responses are requested regardless of whether a response to the previous RFI was submitted). <BR><BR>BACKGROUND:<BR><BR>The Chemical Biological Medical Systems (CBMS) Medical Identification and Treatment Systems (MITS) Joint Project Management Office (JPMO) is responsible for the development, procurement, fielding, and sustaining of medical treatment and prophylactic capabilities against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear agents.  The current CBMS-MITS portfolio includes therapeutics, pretreatments and prophylactics at varying stages of clinical development, including FDA-approved drugs.  <BR><BR>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:  <BR><BR>The Department of Defense has a requirement for a capability to rapidly treat the effects of nerve agent poisoning in the central nervous system.  The Centrally-Acting Nerve Agent Treatment System, (CANATS), will encompass the development and addition of a centrally-acting therapeutic to the existing therapy, atropine/oxime/anti-convulsant, as well as to future treatment regimens in order to improve the efficacy of these countermeasures against traditional and non-traditional nerve agents.  Current treatment options do not easily cross the blood-brain barrier to counteract the central symptoms of nerve agent poisoning.  Research indicates that the addition of such centrally-acting compounds increases survival, reduces morbidity, decreases neurological damage to the brain and improves other treatment outcomes in animal models.  The new treatment must provide broad spectrum protection against nerve agent exposure.  <BR><BR>The objective of issuing this RFI is to gather information that will assist in the identification of a potential centrally-acting therapeutic candidate(s).  As such, CBMS-MITS is seeking information on current industry capabilities from interested entities with potential to meet ANY of the following criteria, IN WHOLE OR IN PART:<BR><BR>(1) Describe your company's candidate currently under development, to include general background information, pertinent research efforts, proposed indication(s) and proposed human dose and route of administration.  Specifically, identify the candidate's capabilities to fulfill the treatment requirement specified above, including information to support its centrally-acting potential.  <BR>(2) Provide a status of in vitro and/or animal model development (i.e., small animal species, large animal species, route of exposure).  Include any proprietary information and limitations, if any, on sharing of animal models or testing paradigms with the government and its contractors.  <BR> (3) Provide a summary of any pertinent data resulting from efficacy studies (i.e., route of challenge, animal model); genetic and reproduction toxicology studies; short-term and long-term toxicology studies; range-finding toxicology, toxicokinetic/pharmacokinetic studies; absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) studies; safety pharmacology analysis; mechanism of action studies.<BR>(4) Describe formulation development efforts, the candidate's proposed formulation and any relevant chemical, physical, and immunological characteristics.  Summarize any efforts related to manufacturing process development, to include assay qualification and validation, production qualification and validation, process scale-up.  Provide any available information on candidate stability, shelf-life and storage conditions.<BR>(5) Provide an assessment of candidate maturity, stage of development using the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) for Medical Product Development in Appendix A. <BR>(6) Describe any intellectual property concerns to include your company's rights and ability to sell or license any intellectual property as well as your company's interest in selling or licensing the intellectual property.  Proprietary information should be marked as described in the paragraph below.<BR><BR>Respondents are invited to provide materials related to their capabilities to fulfill ALL OR ANY of the requirements specified above.  Respondents should provide whether their level of interest and current capability is to fulfill the entire scope of the effort, or a limited aspect of the effort, such as teaming as a subcontractor with another firm.  The Government will retain comments and information received in response to this RFI.  Proprietary information should be identified as Company Proprietary.  Do not use Government Security classification markings.<BR>Questions regarding this RFI should be forwarded to the CBMS e-mail address listed below within five (5) days after RFI release.  <BR><BR>SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:<BR><BR>All written responses must be received within fifteen (15) days of issuance of this RFI.  Submissions should: (1) use Microsoft Word or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF); (2) be sent to leo.fratis@us.army.mil; (3) be minimum 11 font on 8.5" X 11" paper; (4) be complete, sufficiently detailed, and organized in a manner that tracks to the information requested in this RFI; (5) include a single company point of contact with name, title, address, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail address(es); and (6) not exceed 10 single sided pages in total (not including cover page and cover letter).  Other media types (i.e. CD, printed technical information) that meet the submission criteria above will be accepted and should be sent to the US Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, ATTN: Leo Fratis, 64 Thomas Johnson Drive, Frederick, Maryland 21702.

<RESPDATE>031111
<CONTACT>Edward A. Langwinski, Contracting Officer, Phone 2564501412, Email edward.langwinski@mda.mil - David S. Hettich, Contract Specialist, Phone 2564501482, Email david.hettich.ctr@mda.mil
<DESC>NOTICE:<br />The Department of Defense (DoD) is currently operating under a Continuing Resolution Authority (CRA). MDA anticipates that FY11 funds will be available prior to contract award for the execution of the Objective Simulation Framework contract. This solicitation is being released pursuant to FAR Clause 52.232-18 - Availability of Funds. <br />
<p><br />The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) releases the attached Request for Proposal (RFP) pursuant to a competitive acquisition for the Objective Simulation Framework contract to enhance its current suite of modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) frameworks. The current frameworks (the Digital Simulation Framework [DSA] and the Single Stimulation Framework [SSF]) integrate models from each of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) program elements into a system that accurately represents the performance of fielded BMDS equipment against a variety of threats in realistic environments. The desired framework, hereafter called the Objective Simulation Framework (OSF), will leverage existing or mature capabilities, develop common interfaces, or propose a combination of both, to join digital and hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) representations into a modular, scalable, reconfigurable, and compose-able system.</p>
<p>The MDA OSF contract includes: the development, deployment and sustainment of an OSF Modeling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S) framework that will replace the existing digital (DSA) and hardware-in-the-loop (SSF) systems; the sustainment of the legacy framework/architecture as required until OSF is deployed, and; other requirements as detailed within the Request for Proposal (RFP) package.</p>
<p>MDA anticipates the award of a single OSF Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract with Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee, Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee, Fixed-Priced-Incentive (Firm Target) and Firm-Fixed-Price pricing arrangements to occur by July 2011. The contract is expected to have a five (5) year period of performance without any option periods. The solicitation will be awarded in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 on a full and open competitive basis. MDA intends to award to a single offeror on a "best value" basis to the Government, considering both price and non-price factors. The proposal instructions and evaluation factors for award are included in the solicitation and located in the Files Section herein.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to limit either the number or types of teaming arrangements entered into by potential Offerors, i.e., any given contractor can propose as a prime contractor and/or participate as a subcontractor on one or more proposing teams. Further, the Government does not intend to impose restrictions on team membership after award, except as may be necessary to prevent organizational conflicts of interest. However, for the purposes of this competition, the prime offeror(s) and its subcontractors/suppliers must be U.S. firms/businesses, not foreign owned, controlled, or influenced.</p>
<p>An Offeror's Library for this acquisition has been established and contains both classified and export-controlled data. Access to the information contained in the Offeror's Library will be restricted to personnel who have been pre-cleared by MDA contracting and security officials. The Offeror's Library may be obtained by submitting the attached Offeror's Library request forms (Attachment L-1 OSF Offeror's Library Request Form-Unclassified, and Attachment L-1a OSF Offeror's Library Request Form-Classified) to OSFCompetition@mda.mil. Deadline to request the Offeror's Library is 10 February 2011.</p>
<p>Release of this RFP is NOT a commitment by the Government to award a contract and the Government is NOT responsible for any costs incurred as a result of this release.</p>
<p>Industry is reminded that interested Offerors may register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive email notification when additional information, additional solicitation documentation, and/or any amendments or future documents regarding this acquisition are issued and available for downloading. MDA will not directly send Offerors the solicitation documents or any amendments. It is the interested Offeror's responsibility to periodically check this website for updates.</p>
<p>Please be advised that all communications concerning this acquisition (including, but not limited to, management / technical issues, pricing issues, administration issues, and proposal issues) must be coordinated through the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO), Mr. Edward Langwinski at Edward.Langwinski@mda.mil with a copy to OSFCompetition@mda.mil.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is N00421-11-R-0017 and is issued as a request for proposal. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-15. The requirement will be full and open and the place of performance will be an offsite location near Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.</p>
<p>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, NAS Patuxent River is requesting Internet services for the following two locations: 1) Exploration IV and 2) Expedition IV, Lexington Park, MD. Services requested cover the procurement of circuit installation as well as monthly recurring charges. The circuits will temporarily feed internet connectivity to NMCI Deployable Site Transport Boundaries (DSTB) until a permanent DISA circuit and NMCI boundary can be procured. The following services requested in this SOW:</p>
<p>Provide a 1 GIG Fiber Port Internet Connection supplying 15 Mbps into a Navy provided CISCO 2811 with Dynamic IP Addresses to support 120 users at 46579 Expedition Drive (Bldg IV) suite 300, Lexington Park MD, 20653.<br /><br />The second location is to provide a 1 GIG Fiber Port Internet Connection supplying 7 Mbps into a Navy provided CISCO 2811 with Dynamic IP Addresses to support 60 users at 22299 Exploration Drive, (Bldg IV) suite 300, Lexington Park MD, 20653.</p>
<p>The NMCI DSTB is configured with the following data interfaces: a) dual T-1, b) single Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL), c) single Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and d) single gigabit multi-mode fiber. In order to accommodate NMCI bandwidth requirements of the users within these spaces the only solution is to utilize the gigabit fiber interface. Early market research of data services availability indicates Verizon Business and Metrocast are the only suitable service provider in these geographic locations that can provide gigabit fiber connectivity</p>
<p>This action is required for the command to stay in compliance with force protection regulations governing occupancy. The command is currently in violation of these regulations in Exploration V and is realigning space allocations to new leased spaces (where these circuits will be installed). Given the criticality of the customer requirement utilizing the Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) CSA will be the most suitable method to acquire this solution in a timely manner.<br /><br /><br />The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition. The provision at 52.212-2 is applicable to this requirement and the evaluation criteria to be used in paragraph (a) are as follows: technical capability, price and past performance are in descending order of importance.&nbsp;Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, with their offer. Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition and these additional FAR clauses cited in the clause are applicable to this acquisition: 52.222-26, 52.232-33. DFARS 252.204-7004 "Required Central Contractor Registration" applies to all solicitations issued on/after 6/1/98. Lack of registration in CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award. Please ensure compliance with this regulation when submitting your offer. Call 1-888-227-2423 or view at http://www.ccr.gov/for more information. The total fixed price&nbsp;will be the&nbsp;sum of all prices&nbsp;Awards will be made to the contractor(s) whose proposal is/are determined to be the&nbsp;lowest price technically accpectable&nbsp;based upon the above evaluation criteria. The Government may elect not to make any awards, or to make award to one or more contractors for any combination. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Send quotes via email to the attention of James Findlay, Email address: James.Findlay@Navy.mil.

<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS. (APR 2010)<br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-(A) Are &#10063; are not &#10063; presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have &#10063; have not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); (C) Are &#10063; are not &#10063; presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; (D) Have &#10063;, have not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has &#10063; has not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious,or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. (End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).<br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

I believe the site visit will help in determining whether more cables will be needed.

Services will support any and all real estate programs, domains, and disciplines consistent with AFRPA's and AFCEE's roles and responsibilities. Perform tasks that require knowledge of Federal, State, and/or local regulations and statutes, as well as Air Force and DoD regulations and documentation. Provide logistical and organizational support for the conduct of studies, workshops, conferences and technical assistance site visits at Air Force installations. Perform requirement studies and analyses; review documents and drawings; perform cost, risk and feasibility analyses; prepare required documentation to include technical reports or specialized graphics; assist in and present technology demonstrations, and facilitate technical workshops and partnering meetings. Develop support documents to include solicitation documents, real estate appraisals, land leases and conveyance documents. Evaluate private sector and business proposals, use agreements, management and operations plans, and other financial and legal instruments currently in use in the private sector pursuant to the Air Force's policy of promoting the efficient and economical use of Air Force real property assets. Develop and employ application programs in support of AFRPA's and AFCEE's requirements. Provide occasional expert legal support pursuant to issues germane with AFRPA's and AFCEE's role with clients. These activities may require proven and/or innovative technologies and methods to accomplish the work. <br /><br />The Air Force (AF) intends to award multiple, Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS), firm-fixed price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), contracts with a program amount, not-to-exceed, $40 million.

In accordance with the provisions of DFARS 252.204-7004, ALTERNATE A, CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION; offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.

THERE IS NO COMMITMENT BY THE AIR FORCE EITHER TO MAKE ANY CONTRACT AWARD OR TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY MONEY EXPENDED BY THE OFFEROR BEFORE A CONTRACT AWARD.<br /><br />Firms responding to this Request For Proposal, please submit their proposal to afceeress2011@us.af.mil on or before 10 February 2011 4:00 P.M.

QUANTITY REQUIRED DELIVERY DATE<br /><br /><br />The Government will evaluate equally, as regards time of delivery, offers that propose delivery of each quantity within the applicable delivery period specified above. Offers that propose delivery that will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. The Government reserves the right to award under either the required delivery schedule or the proposed delivery schedule, when an offeror offers an earlier delivery schedule than required above. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the required delivery schedule above will apply.<br />OFFEROR'S PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE<br />ITEM NO. QUANTITY PROPOSED DELIVERY DATE (PROVIDE SCHEDULE)<br /><br /><br />(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed, or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror, results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day award is dated. Therefore, the offeror should compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding<br />(1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or<br />(2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.<br />(End of Clause)<br />FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items<br />FAR 52.212-5 (dev) Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items.<br />FAR 52.215-5 Facsimile Proposals<br />FAR 52.219-28 Post-Award Small Business Program Rerepresentation.<br />As prescribed in 19.308(d), insert the following clause:<br />Post-Award Small Business Program Rerepresentation (Apr 2009)<br />(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--<br />Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority.<br />Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size standard in paragraph (c) of this clause. Such a concern is "not dominant in its field of operation" when it does not exercise a controlling or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.

If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>This is a request for Architect-Engineer (A-E) Qualifications statements from A-E firms interested in providing A-E services for the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Building 1 Renovation (B1R) project on NIST's Boulder, CO campus. This procurement is being conducted in accordance with the requirements of the Brooks Act as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.6. The NAICS code for this project is 541310.
<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Building 1 at NIST Boulder (also known as the Radio Building) was constructed in 1954. Building 1 is a cast-in-place reinforced concrete building. It serves as the main laboratory facility for research and measurements at NIST Boulder, supporting the NIST mission to provide measurements, standards, and technology that advance economic growth and address national needs. Building 1 comprises a total of 300,000 square feet, and includes administrative and support staff offices as well as laboratories. Building 1 includes a wide range of laboratory facilities that support research and measurements in areas such as electronics, nanotechnology, time and frequency measurements, quantum computing and quantum communications, laser science, optics, superconducting sensors, radio-frequency communications, magnetic field measurements, and many other areas. In many of these areas NIST Boulder performs the world's best research and measurements, including the world's leading quantum computing research programs, the world's most accurate atomic clocks, and some of the world's most sensitive measurements using unique superconducting devices. Building 1 also includes two clean room facilities for the fabrication of unique nanoscale instruments that are used for NIST Boulder research and measurements. The extremely demanding and sensitive research and measurements performed in Building 1 require tight control of environmental conditions such as temperature, vibration, humidity, and air quality.</p>
<p>Environmental and space requirements for the B1R are based on extensive programmatic studies of NIST's technically demanding scientific programs, many of which directly or indirectly support US competitiveness. The building environmental requirements for programs slated for the B1R are not being effectively and economically met with laboratory space currently occupying a structure dedicated in 1954. Renovation of Building 1 is a necessity for NIST's continued long-term support of US industrial competitiveness in the world market. The B1R will provide extensive renovation of approximately half of Building 1, including Wings 3, 5, 6 and a portion of the Center Spine. This will provide 80,000 net assignable square feet of high performance laboratory space to perform research and measurements needed by industry and the scientific community. The renovation will support key technology areas such as nanotechnology, biotechnology, new energy sources, computing and telecommunications in a high performance facility. Renovated spaces shall be sufficient to support NIST's vision well into the 21st Century and will be supportive of infrastructure recently developed on site. The finished environment shall be supportive of internal collaboration and informal interaction and shall be energy efficient. The complexity of the program is evident from the numerous and diverse research divisions and support organizations located on the campus. The B1R consists of enhanced temperature control down to +/- 0.5 degree C, humidity control to +/- 5%, continuous air flow with filtration to class 10,000, vibration control, and new service corridors to provide lab support space for utilities in addition to the pedestrian corridor.</p>
<p>Electrical elements included in the renovation will address components such as lighting, power distribution, power quality, electromagnetic interference, and standby emergency power for critical laboratory functions. The B1R will locate the bus ducts in the service corridors. Chilled water, steam, and compressed air will be supplied from the Boulder Site's Central Utility Plant. Communication elements that will be addressed include infrastructure components such as telephone cabling and fiber optic networks for data. Life safety and building security elements in the renovation include components such as fire alarm systems, fire sprinkler systems, and building access control. Renovation design and construction will comply with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and will be submitted for LEED (Silver) certification for existing buildings.</p>
<p>This project must demonstrate the value of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs; balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; and creates environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees. As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal energy targets and security requirements.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The A-E firm shall provide pre-construction services to include detailed cost estimating of a $40 - $80 million construction contract for the Building 1 Renovation on a federal campus. In addition to cost estimating, the selected A/E shall provide constructability reviews, value engineering recommendations, provide design reviews at the various design submittal stages for two years. Due to the size of the project, the Architectural-Engineering (A-E) firm's contract with NIST is projected to range from $3.5 to $5 million dollars for design services to include all architecture, engineering, hazardous material/soil testing, inspections, laboratory de-commissioning standards, survey work, coordination with multiple federal, state, and local agencies and municipalities.</p>
<p>The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional Architecture and Engineering Services. NIST estimates that 65% of the design will fall under the engineering discipline while the remaining 35% will fall under the architectural discipline. The scope of work will require at a minimum: construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), (BIM) and post construction contract services (PCCS) for a federal campus that includes the decommissioning of existing laboratories and the construction of interior and exterior upgrades, site development, client program requirements, and sustainable features. The facility will be designed in English Units.</p>
<p>Summary of Project Design Requirements:<br />&bull; Develop a master plan of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems.<br />&bull; Identify required system capacities.<br />&bull; Integrate utility plan into project scope<br />&bull; Create Building 1 project scope, budget, and phasing with assistance of project stakeholders.<br />&bull; Add and integrate utility infrastructure into architectural and structural revisions to Building 1.<br />&bull; Integrate and upgrade office and research laboratory requirements into existing spaces. <br />&bull; Upgrade building elements to comply with current code requirements.</p>

<p>This update is to issue Request for Proposal FA2550-09-R-8001. Please see attached Cover Letter and Solicitation with attachments. This solicitation is open to all interested, responsible offerors. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330 ($27M).</p>
<p>A Pre-Proposal Conference/Site Visit is scheduled to be held at Schriever AFB at 8:30 AM MST on 8 December 2010. A Secret security clearance will be required for any attendees to the site visit. Each company will be restricted to two attendees. Please see Section L of the solicitation for specific details and requirements for those wishing to attend.</p>
<p><span><br /><br />The 50th Contracting Squadron at Schriever Air Force Base (SAFB), Colorado, intends to award a contract for support of three separate, but related, areas of the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN): Obscura, Mission Integration &amp; Network Support for the 22d Space Operations Squadron (22 SOPS) ensuring critical engineering and technical support for mission and system capabilities integration in to the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN).</span></p>
<p style="BACKGROUND: white; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">The OMINS effort encompasses a full complement of engineering and technical activities necessary to provide 22 SOPS with SOC-to-AFSCN-to-Satellite mission integration and troubleshooting support for new and existing satellite programs (for both internal and external users), multiple system modifications and upgrades, new and existing remote tracking stations, and operational complexes, as well as technical and management support for AFSCN Obscura and Network-common data. Mission Integration (MI) provides a wide variety of integration support activities to help bring new satellites, systems, and upgrades on-line for the AFSCN. Some of these activities include evaluating new satellite program requirements for AFSCN compatibility, integration, test and troubleshooting support for new systems and programs, technical consultation for pre-launch, launch and on-orbit problem resolution, and other unique AFSCN-specific complications that cannot be resolved by other organizations.</span></p>
<p style="BACKGROUND: white; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Obscura support provides for data collection, analysis, and management for Obscura (hard and soft Obscura), Radiation Hazard (RADHAZ), Permissible Exposure Levels (PELs), and determination of Transmit Inhibit Zones (TIZs) for the AFSCN, including the development and operation of an automated obscura analysis capability. Obscura data provides the information required to effectively establish and maintain terrain and building survey data (known as "hard" obscura data) as well as vegetation growth ("soft" obscura) that can interfere with reception and transmission of satellite data. Additionally, obscura data is collected when new antennas are installed or construction is underway for these new assets, or any near-by constructions or activities. Obscura data is also gathered which will identify the optimal location to maximize satellite support activities. Obscura support includes the analysis of raw obscura data from the 85th Engineering Installation Squadron (85 EIS) and utilizes the Automated Obscura and Analysis Capability (AOAC) tool to establish recommended TIZs for the AFSCN to ensure the safety of personnel from RF exposure. Obscura surveys involve obtaining and recording measured Electromagnetic data, and then analyzing, smoothing, and documenting recommended values to update the AFSCN Automated Remote Tracking Station (ARTS) Antenna Control Units (ACUs) for implementation of the recommended TIZ values.</span></p>
<p style="BACKGROUND: white; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Network Support manages and distributes data which is vital and common to all AFSCN users. This effort is accomplished through the Network Data Management and Control (NDMC) effort which manages, maintains, and modifies the network-common (NET-C) data stored in a central repository accessed by AFSCN users for the implementation of distinct operational parameters critical to their mission success.<br /><br /></span></p>

C.  Description of changes;  The purpose of this announcement is to incoporate clauses and provisions into the request for quotations.  The following are incorporated:   SECTION G -- CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION DATA 

G.1	GP-1	IDENTIFICATION OF CORRESPONDENCE 	NOVEMBER 2009
All correspondence between the Government and the Contractor concerned with matters concerning this contract shall be forwarded to the Contracting Officer at the following address:

 SECTION H -- SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS 

H.1	DIAPR 2000-1	NON-DISCRIMINATION NOTICE TO US DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR CONTRACTORS, SUBCONTRACTORS, AND LESSORS	JANUARY 2000
NON-DISCRIMINATION NOTICE TO U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR CONTRACTORS, SUBCONTRACTORS, AND LESSORS (DEC 1999)Based upon law, Executive Order, or internal policy, the Department of the Interior prohibits discrimination in the workplace, including sexual harassment, based on race, color, national origin, sex, religion, disability, age, or sexual orientation. The Department urges its contractors, subcontractors and lessors to develop and enforce comprehensive anti-discrimination policies for their places of work. 
This notice states that Department's non-discrimination policy and encourages the same from its contractors, subcontractors, and lessors. With the exception of categories protected by law, compliance is voluntary and no extraordinary enforcement or protection mechanisms on the part of the Government are implied.

H.2	DIG 2010-04	PROHIBITION ON TEXT MESSAGING AND USING ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT SUPPLIED BY THE GOVERNMENT WHILE DRIVING	MARCH 2010
Executive Order 131513, Federal Leadership on Reducing Text Messaging While Driving, was  signed by President Barack Obama on October 1, 2009 (ref.:  http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2009/pdf/E9-24203.pdf).  This Executive Order introduces a Federal Government-wide prohibition on the use of text messaging while driving on official business or while using Government-supplied equipment.  Additional guidance enforcing the ban will be issued at a later date.  In the meantime, please adopt and enforce policies that immediately ban text messaging while driving company-owned or rented vehicles, or while driving privately owned vehicles when on official government business or when performing any work for or on behalf of the government.

H.3	ET 02-20	AUTHORIZED WORKERS NOTICE TO POTENTIAL BUREAU OF RECLAMATION CONTRACTORS	SEPTEMBER 2002
(a) Definitions.
IRCA - Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986INA - Immigration and Nationality ActINS - Immigration and Naturalization Service SSA - Social Security AdministrationINS SAVE Program - The INS Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements ProgramESA - Employment Standards Administration (Department of Labor)
(a) Authority. Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (8 USC 1101 as amended) and the Immigration and Nationality Act, Section 274A.
(b) Who is Covered. INA includes provisions addressing employment eligibility, employment verification, and nondiscrimination. These provisions apply to all employers, including government contractors.
(c) Basic Provisions/Requirements. Under IRCA, employers may hire only persons who may legally work in the U.S., i.e., citizens and nationals of the U.S. and aliens authorized to work in the U.S. The employer must verify the identity and employment eligibility of anyone to be hired, which includes completing the Employment Eligibility Verification Form (I-9). Employers must keep each I-9 on file for at least three years, or one year after employment ends, whichever is longer. Detailed guidance on the I-9 is available at the INS web site:  http://www.uscis.gov/i-9
(d) Employment Verification Pilot Programs. The INS and the SSA are conducting the following programs that provide employers a way to confirm the employment eligibility of their newly hired employees. Any employer located in a pilot state may volunteer to participate in a pilot program. If employers are not located in a pilot state, they would verify employment eligibility by following the procedures currently in place, i.e., by completing Form I-9.
	(1) The Basic Pilot is a joint pilot being conducted by the INS and SSA in the States of California, Florida, Illinois, Nebraska, New York, and Texas. This pilot involves verification checks of the SSA and INS databases of all newly hired employees, regardless of citizenship. To receive information on the Basic Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981, or write to USINS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO Building 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536. You may also contact the Social Security Administration by calling (410) 966-1940, or writing to Social Security Administration, Office of Program Benefits Policy, 6401 Security Blvd., 760 Altmeyer, Baltimore, MD 21235.
	(2) The INS is conducting the Citizen Attestation Pilot in the States of Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Virginia. The Citizen Attestation Pilot permits participating employers to electronically verify the employment eligibility of newly hired alien employees by using a personal computer with a modem. To receive information on the Citizen Attestation Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981. Employers may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.
	(3) The INS and the SSA are conducting the Machine-Readable Document Pilot in the State of Iowa. The Machine-Readable Document Pilot is identical to the Basic Pilot in all respects, except for the geographic scope of the pilot and for one additional feature. If an employee presents an Iowa's driver's license or identification card containing a machine-readable SSN, the employer will make an inquiry through the confirmation system by using the machine-readable feature. To receive information on the Machine-Readable Document Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981. You may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.
(e) Employee Rights. The INA protects U.S. citizens and aliens authorized to accept employment in the U.S. from discrimination in hiring or discharge on the basis of national origin and citizenship status.
(f) Compliance Assistance. More detailed information, including copies of explanatory brochures and regulatory and interpretative materials, may be obtained from local offices of the Department of Labor's Employment Standards Division, Wage and Hour Division, and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.
(g) Penalties/Sanctions. Employers who fail to complete and/or retain the I-9 forms are subject to penalties. The INS enforces the INA requirements on verification of employment eligibility. The Justice Department enforces the anti-discrimination provisions. As part of their ongoing enforcement efforts, the ESA's Wage and Hour Division and Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs conduct inspections of the I-9 forms. They report their findings to the INS and to the Department of Justice when they find cases of disparate treatment or unauthorized employment. A debarring official may debar a contractor, based on a determination by the Attorney General of the United States, or designee, that the contractor is not in compliance with the INA. The Attorney General's determination is not reviewable in the debarment proceedings

The primary objective of this prospective contract would be to assist the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) in key program areas as they relate to the use of technology and knowledge transfer to influence the development of policies and procedures within State departments of transportations (DOTs) to provide improved benefits to the traveling public by optimizing the operations of state transportation systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also<span style="COLOR: black"> intended to provide a mechanism for promoting, enhancing and expanding the role of transportation systems operations within the departments of transportation (DOT) of the States.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because the organization structure related to the DOT is different among the States, often subject to change because of changes in the administrations of the States, and potentially politically sensitive, a national association with the technical and institutional knowledge, history and respect of the State DOT administrations is necessary to effectively provide this operations support. Interested parties should submit a description of their capabilities for satisfying this requirement which demonstrates they possess the ability to successfully perform this effort. All questions concerning this matter should be addressed directly to Rob Miller at Rob.Miller@dot.gov, or by telephone at 202-366-9167. </span></span></p>

<DESC>SYNOPSIS FOR SELECTION OF A FIRM FIXED PRICE CONTRACT FOR A-E DESIGN OF A MEDICAL COUNTERMEASURE TEST &amp; EVALUATION FACILITY, FORT DETRICK, MARYLAND<br /><br />UNRESTRICTED COMPETITION<br /><br />1. CONTRACT INFORMATION<br />This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6. It is anticipated that (1) firm fixed price "C" contract will be awarded for design services required for the construction of a Medical Countermeasure Test &amp; Evaluation Facility located on the National Interagency Biodefense Campus at Fort Detrick, Maryland. The estimated construction cost of this project is in the range of $400 million to $800 million. The contract will be negotiated as a fixed fee with a base scope of work and options as deemed necessary and may include fast-track design packages under Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) procedures. Selection of A-E firms is based upon the professional qualifications necessary for performance of the required services. A-E services are required for site investigation, planning, programming, survey and geotech report (option), engineering studies including permit application, schematic design (charrette), concept design, final design, commissioning (option), and construction phase services (option) for the subject project. Construction phase services will include laboratory/vivarium bio-containment commissioning, preparation of operation and maintenance manuals, and shop drawing review and approval. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541330. The Product Service Code (PSC) is C118, Research and Development Facilities. This is an unrestricted acquisition and is open to all businesses regardless of size. A firm fixed price A-E contract will be negotiated with a 7-year period of performance; to include approximately two (2) years for design deliverables and five (5) years for the construction phase services. The contract is anticipated to be awarded by June 2011. If a large business is selected for this contract, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it plans to subcontract. The plan is not required with this submittal. <br /><br />SUBCONTRACTING PLAN REQUIREMENTS: In accordance with FAR 19.702(a)(1), a subcontracting plan is required if the firm is a large business. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers goal for small business utilization is 50.0% to small business (SB) dispersed as follows; 17.0% to small disadvantaged business (SDB), 18.0% to women-owned small business (WOSB), 10.0% to HUB Zone small business, 8.5% to Veteran Owned Small Business, and 4.0% Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB). While these are Department of the Army Small Business Subcontracting Goals for FY11, it is the contractor's responsibility to provide realistic, challenging, and achievable goals set forth in a subcontracting plan and will be negotiated prior to contract award. Subcontracting plans will be evaluated IAW FAR 19.705-4, and must receive a rating of "acceptable". Failure to submit and negotiate an acceptable Small Business Subcontracting Plan will make any Large Business Offeror ineligible for contract award. <br /><br />2. PROJECT INFORMATION<br />This project will provide dedicated animal testing and evaluation facilities for biodefense and infectious disease countermeasure development, including products and procedures as a result of research. The project will provide an approximately 460,000 square-foot, new multi-story medical research facility at Fort Detrick, Maryland.

THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD.  ALL INFORMATION REQUIRED TO SUBMIT THE SF330 DOCUMENTS IS CONTAINED HEREIN.  QUESTIONS PERTAINING TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO KATHALEEN SCHOLLARD AT KATHALEEN.SCHOLLARD@USACE.ARMY.MIL. <BR><BR>The Seattle District Corps of Engineers has a requirement for an Architect-Engineer Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) Contract for Multi-Discipline Design and Construction Support Services, primarily for Joint Base Lewis-McChord (JBLM) and its Sub-Installations.  This procurement will be evaluated using Brooks Act (PL-92-582) procedures and FAR Part 36. THIS IS AN UNRESTRICTED ACQUISITION OPEN TO ALL QUALIFIED BUSINESS CONCERNS. The scope and purpose of this IDIQ contract will be to provide full multi-discipline and abbreviated design services for renovation, repair and minor construction projects, as well as to provide construction support services, primarily for projects at Joint Base Lewis-McChord and its sub-installations.  Individual Task Orders to be assigned under this contract will identify specific requirements.  <BR><BR>(A) DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  The Architect-Engineer (A-E) shall perform all or part of the following design services, as identified in individual Task Orders:   <BR><BR>1. General Scope: Prepare full or abbreviated designs, drawings, specifications, charrettes, preliminary studies, sketches, layout plans, surveys, reports, engineering calculations, and design-build Request for Proposal (RFP) packages and cost estimates for a variety of projects involving the maintenance, repair, alteration and/or new construction of projects at Joint Base Lewis-McChord and its sub-installations and projects assigned to Seattle District, USACE. Designs may also include design-build projects requiring preparation of material takeoffs and bills of materials. The Government may provide government designs, drawings, specifications, and standards for buildings, structures and other facilities as necessary to assist the A-E firm in meeting the requirements of the proposed project.  The number of copies of the RFP packages, designs, studies, sketches, plans and reports to be furnished to the Government will be set forth in each individual Task Order. <BR><BR>2. Cost Estimates: A portion of the task orders may include designs with detailed cost estimates utilizing the Army Job Order Contract (JOC) Computerized Pricing Guide (CPG) WinEst.  WinEst is a Windows based RS Means database program designed for IBM PC compatible computers. This CPG system has been selected for use as the cost basis for all work under the JOC and may also be used for negotiated orders under the JBLM Multi Award Task Order Contracts (MATOC). The CPG contains more than 55,000 unit price construction line items for the description of work to be accomplished and for the unit of measure specified. Line item costs will be determined by multiplying the RS Means Bare Costs by the nearest available City Cost Index to localize the bare costs. The localized bare costs are then multiplied by the JOC or MATOC Contractor's coefficient. Cost estimates shall be automated utilizing the latest version of the automated pricing system. Multiple annual databases may be utilized depending on the date estimates are prepared or the terms of the individual JOC and MATOC contracts.  Cost estimates may also be required for designs that will result in award of a construction task order against a Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) or sole source stand alone contract where negotiations with only one contractor will be required. As such, effort under the Multi-Discipline AE contract Task Order may also include supporting government project managers in their negotiations with contractors prior to award of construction Task Orders.  <BR><BR>3.

The number of copies of the RFP packages, designs, studies, sketches, plans and reports to be furnished to the Government will be set forth in each individual Task Order. <BR><BR><BR>2. Cost Estimates: A portion of the task orders may include designs with detailed cost estimates utilizing the Army Job Order Contract (JOC) Computerized Pricing Guide (CPG) WinEst.  WinEst is a Windows based RS Means database program designed for IBM PC compatible computers. This CPG system has been selected for use as the cost basis for all work under the JOC and may also be used for negotiated orders under the JBLM Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOC). The CPG contains more than 55,000 unit price construction line items for the description of work to be accomplished and for the unit of measure specified. Line item costs will be determined by multiplying the RS Means Bare Costs by the nearest available City Cost Index to localize the bare costs. The localized bare costs are then multiplied by the JOC or MATOC Contractor's coefficient. Cost estimates shall be automated utilizing the latest version of the automated pricing system. Multiple annual databases may be utilized depending on the date estimates are prepared or the terms of the individual JOC and MATOC contracts.  Cost estimates not generated out of WinEst may also be required for designs that will result in award of a construction task order against a Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) or sole source stand alone contract where negotiations with only one contractor will be required. As such, effort under Task Orders may also include supporting government project managers in their negotiations with contractors prior to award of construction Task Orders.  <BR><BR><BR>3.

QUESTIONS PERTAINING TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO KATHALEEN SCHOLLARD AT KATHALEEN.SCHOLLARD@USACE.ARMY.MIL. <BR><BR>The Seattle District Corps of Engineers has a requirement for an Architect-Engineer Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) Contract for Civil/Environmental Design and Construction Support Services, primarily for Joint Base Lewis-McChord Washington and its Sub-Installations. This procurement will be evaluated using Brooks Act (PL-92-582) procedures and FAR Part 36. THIS IS AN UNRESTRICTED ACQUISITION OPEN TO ALL QUALIFIED BUSINESS CONCERNS. The scope and purpose of this IDIQ contract will be to provide Architect-Engineering (A-E) services for civil and environmental design, abbreviated design and construction support services primarily for Joint Base Lewis-McChord (JBLM), Washington and its sub-installations.  Required services will include full or abbreviated design services, civil/environmental design, and environmental studies for renovation, repair and minor construction projects, as well as construction support services.  Services under this IDIQ may also include some landscaping, mechanical, and electrical design.  Individual task orders to be assigned under this contract will identify specific requirements.  <BR><BR><BR>(A) DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  The Architect-Engineer (A-E) shall perform all or part of the following design services, as identified in individual Task Orders:   <BR><BR>1. General Scope: Prepare full or abbreviated designs, drawings, specifications, preliminary studies, sketches, layout plans, surveys, reports, engineering calculations, and design-bid-build and design-build Request for Proposal (RFP) packages and cost estimates for a variety of projects involving the maintenance, repair, alteration and/or new construction of projects, mainly for civil/environmental studies and design services at Joint Base Lewis-McChord and its sub-installations and projects assigned to Seattle District, USACE. Designs may also include design-build projects requiring preparation of material takeoffs and bills of materials. The Government may provide government designs, drawings, specifications, and standards for buildings, structures and other facilities as necessary to assist the A-E firm in meeting the requirements of the proposed project.  The number of copies of the RFP packages, designs, studies, sketches, plans and reports to be furnished to the Government will be set forth in each individual Task Order. <BR><BR><BR>2. Cost Estimates: A portion of the task orders may include designs with detailed cost estimates utilizing the Army Job Order Contract (JOC) Computerized Pricing Guide (CPG) WinEst.  WinEst is a Windows based RS Means database program designed for IBM PC compatible computers. This CPG system has been selected for use as the cost basis for all work under the JOC and may also be used for negotiated orders under the JBLM Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOC). The CPG contains more than 55,000 unit price construction line items for the description of work to be accomplished and for the unit of measure specified. Line item costs will be determined by multiplying the RS Means Bare Costs by the nearest available City Cost Index to localize the bare costs. The localized bare costs are then multiplied by the JOC or MATOC Contractor's coefficient. Cost estimates shall be automated utilizing the latest version of the automated pricing system. Multiple annual databases may be utilized depending on the date estimates are prepared or the terms of the individual JOC and MATOC contracts.  Cost estimates not generated out of WinEst may also be required for designs that will result in award of a construction task order against a Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) or sole source stand alone contract where negotiations with only one contractor will be required. As such, effort under Task Order may also include supporting government project managers in their negotiations with contractors prior to award of construction Task Orders.<BR><BR><BR>3.

PLACE OF CONTRACT PERFORMANCE:   Various locations across the United States including, but not limited to, Washington DC, Austin TX and St. Petersburg, FL.

SET-ASIDE STATUS:   Total Set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB)

SUMMARY:
 The mission of VBA, in partnership with the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA), is to provide benefits and services to Veterans and their families in a responsive, timely, and compassionate manner in recognition of their service to the Nation.

VBA has six lines of business, which deliver services and benefits to Veterans. These are:

* Benefits Assistance Service (BAS)
* Compensation and Pension (C&P)
* Education
* Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E)
* Insurance
* Loan Guaranty

For more information regarding these lines of business and the various benefits and services they provide, please visit http://www.vba.va.gov/VBA/index.asp.

Each line of business has several unique software applications and systems enabling the establishment, development, and payment of over $47 billion annually in benefits claims. VBA, in conjunction with VA's Office of Information and Technology (OI&T), is in the process of modifying, upgrading, and replacing a number of these applications and systems, and will likely devote significant effort to such activities throughout the period of performance of this contract. While OI&T is responsible for their development, deployment, and maintenance of applications and systems, VBA is responsible for all business requirements gathering, user testing, training, and organizational change management required to implement new software and hardware, as well as any non-IT support services (e.g., business support services) that provide inputs to system implementation efforts. VBA does not develop any applications or systems internally. Any information technology assets or services associated with these VBA projects will be procured by OI&T using separate contract vehicles.

VBA requires on-site project management support and business analysis services for its staff offices, business lines and affiliate VA organizations.

VBA staff offices, business lines and affiliates (hereafter VBA organizations) require these services to support the business activities surrounding their management of business initiatives and the design, development, implementation, modification, sustainment and portfolio management of their software applications and systems. Multiple VBA organizations have projects and programs that currently require such services and as these projects and programs are completed, or as new priorities arise, some VBA organizations may require less support while others may require additional support or support for the first time.

Project management support and business analysis services shall be performed on a firm fixed price and/or labor hour basis. To compensate for the fluid nature of this requirement, this contract will be an multiple award, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. VBA organizations will independently procure services via task order proposal requests (TOPRs) against this IDIQ contract. Each TOPR will be evaluated based on a price proposal, past performance information and a technical/management plan, then a TO will be subsequently awarded to the ID/IQ Contractor whose TOPR proposal provides best value to the Government.  Services will be performed by contractors in labor categories defined in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) provided in the solicitation. TOPRs will specify the number of contractors in each labor category (and therefore the services) needed by the requiring VBA organization, whether the services shall be performed on a firm fixed price or labor hour basis, any required deliverables and any special conditions associated with performance.

TOs will be aligned with individual VBA organizations and each TO will be managed by a Government Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) who has direct experience in the business requirement on which the TO is focused.

The Contractor shall perform the work in accordance with this RFQ, the resultant contract, and the detailed individual TOs.

The Government intends to make multiple awards as a result of this solicitation. It is anticipated that the awarded contracts (ID/IQ) will have a five (5) year period of performance. The solicitation will be issued on or about January 7, 2011 with an anticipated closing date on or about January 28, 2011.

NOTE:   This document is a modification to the Pre-Solicitation Notice related to VA Solicitation  Number  VA798-11-RP-0014, which was issued on January 7, 2011.  This modification is necessary to correct certain errors within the the FedBizOpps (fbo.gov) Solicitation.  Specifically, the Archive Date for the Solicitation is extended to 30 days past the closing date of the Solicitation.  Also, the Set-Aside Status is modified to reflect a Total Set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB).  Interested parties shall refer to the Solicitation VA798-11-RP-0014 for requirements for proposal submission.

<AWARDEE>Organizational Strategies, Incorporated, 2231 Crystal Drive Ste 1116, Arlington, VA 22202-3711 US
<DESC>Rationale Justifying FAR 6.302-2, "Unusual and Compelling Urgency":<br />This is a bridge effort to task order M801 under SeaPort-e contract N00178-05-D-4482 that was competitively awarded as a CPFF order to Organizational Strategies, Incorporated for a base year and 4 option years of performance which ended 30 November 2010. The follow-on PMA-275 Training IPT Support Services requirement was competed through SeaPort-e and awarded to OSI on 24 November 2010. Subsequently, a GAO protest was filed and a stop-work order issued to OSI on 13 December 2010. The purpose of the procurement covered by this J&amp;A is to bridge the PMA-275 Training IPT Support Services effort until resolution of the issues surrounding the competitively awarded follow-on.
<p>A delay in awarding this support will have a direct impact on the PMA-275 Training IPT's ability to support the critical training requirements of the V-22 aircraft program, which are key to safe and effective combat deployments. The Government does not have a sufficient number of civil service or military employees available to execute these training support requirements. The OSI workforce has knowledge and experience that is crucial to continuing performance of these ongoing tasks. Without the support provided by the OSI workforce under this bridge contract, PMA-275 will not be able to provide the level of support required to ensure the Warfighter is properly trained for combat deployments. The PMA-275 Training IPT needs continuous support for all critical V-22 training events that impact Warfighter safety and operational readiness during this bridge effort, such as:</p>
<p>&bull;Meeting Headquarters Marine Corps-required dates for newly established MV-22 operating bases by providing required training systems to support the new squadrons at those sites.</p>
<p>&bull;Ensuring concurrency and standardization of Marine Corps and Air Force V-22 aircraft training systems and courseware via continuous analyses of impact from aircraft engineering changes.</p>
<p>&bull;Providing critical support to deploying Marine Corps and Air Force squadrons with differences training that prepares the users with knowledge of the most recent changes to aircraft systems and procedures.</p>
<p>&bull;Ensuring on-time delivery of Flight Training Devices (FTD) 3&amp;4 in configuration that is concurrent with the aircraft. FTD 4 is the first such trainer at Cannon AFB and is critical to user operational readiness.</p>
<p>&bull;Ensuring CV-22 Simulators continue to operate, facilitating training events critical to squadron operational readiness and user safety, should malfunctions occur.</p>
<p>&bull;Providing concurrency and standardization of CV-22 simulators with the aircraft in the event of new software releases, which is critical to user safety.</p>
<p>OSI has successfully provided this support to the PMA-275 Training IPT under the previous competitively awarded five-year SeaPort-e task order and has the necessary knowledge and experience to continue to support those critical efforts under this six month bridge contract until resolution of the issues surrounding the competitively awarded follow-on. Therefore, the Navy has awarded this requirement to OSI on a sole source basis under 10 U.S.C. Section 2304(c)(2) as cited in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-2, " Unusual and Compelling Urgency."</p>
<p>Rationale for CPFF/CPIF Contract Type:<br />Uncertainties involved in contract performance prevent estimation of costs with sufficient accuracy.</p>

This will be determined by evaluating the non-pricing factors of the RFQ (including the subfactors), and the pricing factors or price to the Government.  Competing proposals shall be evaluated against the requirements of the solicitation in order to express their strengths, weaknesses, deficiencies, and risks.  <BR><BR><BR><BR>PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS AND EVALUATION FACTORS<BR>GENERAL:<BR><BR>1.  These instructions are designed to provide general guidance for preparing proposals as well as providing instructions on proposal organization, format and content.  The Offeror's proposals should include all documents and information requested and should be submitted in accordance with the instructions.  The Government reserves the right to consider only those proposals submitted in accordance with instructions set forth in this solicitation.

The proposal should be clear, concise, and include adequate detail for effective evaluation.  The proposal should not simply rephrase or restate the Government's requirements, but rather provide convincing rationale to address how the Offeror intends to meet the requirements of the solicitation.  The Government will evaluate proposals based on the information presented in the offeror's proposals.  <BR><BR> <BR>PROPOSAL CONTENT AND FORMAT:<BR><BR>1.  In order to provide all necessary information for a comprehensive technical evaluation and price analysis, offerors must submit a proposal in three (3) separate sections and be clearly and concisely written as well as being indexed and logically assembled.  Proposals should be clearly stated so that Government personnel with general training can make a thorough evaluation and arrive at a sound determination as to whether the services proposed would satisfy the stated requirements.<BR><BR>2.  PART 1 - TECHNICAL APPROACH FACTOR  <BR><BR>a. Offerors must submit written data to support their understanding of the requirement and their proposed means of fulfilling the requirement.  Offerors should provide a complete narrative for each element listed under the Technical Approach Subfactors as stated below.  NOTE:  Statements that "the Offeror understands", "can or will comply with all specifications", statements paraphrasing the specifications or parts thereof, or phrases such as "standard procedures will be used" or "well known techniques will be used" will be considered insufficient and could render the proposal as unacceptable.<BR><BR>	b.  Subfactor 1:  Experience of Personnel:<BR><BR>(1)	Demonstrate expertise and experience of personnel proposed to perform the services as well as equipment and supplies that will be used to perform the required tasks<BR><BR>(2)	Describe and provide documentation of all applicable certifications, licenses, permits, (i.e. State Electrician Licenses, OSHA/NFPA/IEEE/NETA compliant certifications etc.) for instructors.

Subfactor 2:  Scheduling of Tasks:<BR><BR>(1)	Demonstrate a clear understanding of the all the technical features involved in performing the tasks identified in the overall contract Performance Work Statement (i.e. Detailed Course Outlines with tentative  and course material samples for some specified requirements).   <BR><BR>3.  PART 2 - PAST PERFORMANCE FACTOR <BR><BR>a.  Offeror's Past Performance information submitted as required by FAR 52.212-1, instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, will be used to make a determination of the level of performance risk associated with each offeror.  Offerors should provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for at least three prior contracts that are similar in size and scope and complexity to this requirement,  performed within the last five (5) years.  References should also be provided for any anticipated subcontractor to be used.   Offerors should provide the following:<BR><BR>		Reference:  Name, Address, POC and phone Numbers<BR>		Contract, Value, and Dates:<BR>		Description of the Contract Effort:<BR>                             Relevance to this Solicitation:<BR>	<BR>b.  Each Offeror will be evaluated on its performance under existing and prior efforts for similar services .  The offeror may include an overall narrative explaining what aspects of the contract efforts are deemed relevant to the proposed effort, as well as significant accomplishments and difficulties.   Offerors are responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all information and the Government does not assume the responsible for conducting research as a result of incorrect reference information of any kind.  The references should be provided in descending order, with the most relevant contracts appearing first.<BR><BR>               c.  Performance information will be used for both the  responsibility determination  as well as an evaluation factor.  The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration.<BR><BR>                d.  Offerors may describe any quality awards or certifications that indicate exceptional capacity to provide the service or product described in Performance Work Statement.<BR><BR>                e. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) may use past performance information obtained from other than the sources identified by the offeror.  USACE shall determine the relevance of similar past performance information.<BR><BR><BR>4.  PART 3 - PRICE FACTOR.  <BR><BR>	a.  The Offeror's Price proposal must consist of the signed copy of the SF 1449 and total prices for the services requested for the Base and Option Periods included on the Continuation Page of the SF 1449.  It is expected that this contract will be awarded based upon a determination that there was adequate price competition; therefore, the offeror is not required to submit or certify cost or pricing data.  However, after receipt of proposals, if the Contracting Officer determines that adequate price competition does not exist in accordance with FAR 15.804-3, the offeror shall be required to provide cost or pricing data.<BR><BR> <BR>5.  BASIS FOR AWARD:<BR><BR>	a.  Award will be made to the responsible Offeror whose proposal contains the combination of those criteria offering the best overall value to the U.S. Government, in accordance with FAR 15.101-1.   The Government reserves the right to consider only those proposals submitted in accordance with all instructions set forth or referenced in this solicitation.  A proposal that omits material elements required by the RFQ may be eliminated from further consideration.  The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is determined to be in the Government's best interests and in accordance with the criteria set forth in this solicitation.  <BR><BR>              b.  The evaluation will be based on a complete assessment of each Offeror's proposal.  The Government will evaluate proposals based on the Evaluation Factors/Criteria identified above.  It is important that Offerors possess a complete understanding of what each factor requires and accurately interprets their relative order of importance when preparing proposals in response to this solicitation.  The cumulative relative importance of the non-pricing evaluation factors is significantly more important when compared to the pricing factor.<BR>  <BR>              c. Evaluation Factors are in descending order of importance with the Technical Approach Factor being significantly more important than Past Performance Factor.  Subfactors listed under Technical approach are of equal importance.<BR><BR>d.  At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions.   IAW with FAR 15.101-1(2), the evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price. <BR><BR>    	e.  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<BR><BR>(End of clause)<BR><BR><BR><BR>Wage Determination for Schofield Barracks, HI (See Attachment)<BR>Wage Determination for Fort Belvoir, VA (See Attachment)<BR>Wage Determination for Fort Bragg, NC (See Attachment)<BR>Contract Manpower Reporting Clause (See Attachment)<BR><BR>Clauses may be accessed electronically in full text through http://farsite.hill.af.mil or www.acquisition.gov/far.
