<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
Document Number: USDA-RFI-NAIP-2007

A. NATIONAL AGRICULTURE IMAGERY PROGRAM (NAIP)
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Farm Service Agency (FSA), Aerial Photography Field Office (APFO) plans to establish a multi-year contract for the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP). The Government anticipates awarding multiple performance-based contracts to support the production of approximately 2.8 million square miles of digital orthorectified imagery annually. These planned contracts will be issued under FAR Part 15 as full and open competition procurements which will include the provisions Buy American Act (FAR 52.225-2) and Small Business Subcontracting Plan (FAR 52.219-9).

B. BACKGROUND
The FSA is responsible for administering USDA farm programs including crop commodity price support, disaster relief, and assistance for conservation practices. FSA administers farm programs in part by digitizing and maintaining agricultural field boundaries, or common land units (CLU) from digital orthoimagery acquired from the NAIP. CLU boundaries consist of fence lines, roads, waterways, and other cultural features, which form the interface between agricultural vegetative cover and non crop vegetative cover on the surface. Another key aspect of farm program administration is to verify that agricultural practices are in accordance with USDA program parameters. FSA has performed this verification by using NAIP imagery which is acquired during peak agricultural growing seasons on an annual basis. The aerial imagery, along with existing program parameters, is viewed in a geographic information system (GIS) at county based USDA Service Centers to show crops and agricultural practices. CLU boundaries are displayed to assist with identification of farm parcels and acreages. The use of NAIP imagery has been successful in providing FSA current orthoimagery for maintaining CLU boundaries and performing farm program administration. It has also provided participating government agencies with current, accurate orthoimagery for their GIS programs. For reference purposes, the Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract and 2006 Task Order for the final year of the current 3 year contract can be downloaded at http://www.fsa.usda.gov/Internet/FSA_File/naip-3-04-mod-5.pdf and http://www.fsa.usda.gov/Internet/FSA_File/rfp-naip-3-04.pdf, respectfully. Questions regarding the current contract can be submitted to john.mootz@slc.usda.gov or faxed to (801) 975-3512 to the attention of Mr. John Mootz.


C. REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
The Government is soliciting responses from industry addressing the questions and issues stated below. Please address all questions and include feedback on all related topics, including impacts to cost, schedules, and risks. If you do not have input on a question or statement, please indicate with ?not applicable? or ?no response?. In addition, please feel free to provide other recommendations or suggestions on NAIP related subjects or issues.

CONTRACT STRATEGY
1. IDIQ Contract Length: While balancing both the Contractor and Government risks and investments, what is the best contract length (5 years maximum) for the upcoming contract? What impact, if any, would rapid technological change and the relative fast migration from film to digital capture and ?lights out? automated production have on the contract length?
2. Imagery For The Nation: How would aligning NAIP standards toward the proposed Imagery for the Nation (IFTN) requirements impact the aerial photography and orthoimagery industry? Part of IFTN is a proposed 1-meter, complete coverage national imagery program that, if fully funded, would enhance FSA?s requirements for both orthophoto and compliance imagery.
3. New horizontal accuracy specifications: Currently, NAIP accuracy specifications are based on matching new imagery to the older ?first generation? orthophotos (i.e. relational control).  The Government is proposing a change to an absolute accuracy  specification with a 1-meter product accuracy requirement of +/- 6-meters (95% of tested points). What is the impact of moving to an absolute control specification? What impact would this change have on processes and risks if this change is phased in over a 3 to 5 year period?
4. Increase product warranty period: In an effort to reduce Government inspection time and thus decrease the final contract payment timeframe, the Government is considering extending the length of the product warranty. What is a reasonable warranty length for imagery products?
5. Small Business Set-Asides: In an effort to meet the FSA?s small business set-aside goals, future NAIP contracts will have mandatory small business set-aside goals as part of the required Small Business Subcontracting Plan for all subcontracts issued by prime contractors that are certified as other than small.  What minimum mandatory goal is considered reasonable? What is the program risk if the goal is above 50%?

CONTRACTOR PAYMENTS
6. Eliminate duplicate DOQQs: The government?s acquisition strategy for NAIP is based on buying and accepting DOQQ imagery at the state level. The Government is considering reducing or eliminating, during final negotiations, the quantities of duplicate DOQQs that span state boundaries and are flown by the same contractor, assuming similar conditions (i.e. flying season and film type). What are the impacts or risks to contractors if this is implemented?  
7. Incentive or Penalty payment for acquisition: One of the primary uses of NAIP is for FSA crop compliance. This requires that the imagery be acquired and produced in a relatively short timeframe ? weeks instead of months. What impact in terms of cost and risk would an incentive and/or penalty payment have on contractors? What potential impact would there be on the program? How should it be implemented?
8. Change to performance-based payment schedule: The current NAIP contract allows for the following performance-based payment schedule: 60% upon imagery acquisition completion; 30% upon delivery of all required products; and the final 10% payment after the Government?s acceptance of project. What is a fair and equitable payment schedule, which better reflects contractor expenditures, while balancing both the contractor and Government risks?

GOVERNMENT FURNISHED MATERIAL
9. Provide a DOQQ list instead of photo-center files: The Government has been providing a photo-center file that contains a list of required exposure stations, based on traditional film-based cameras. However, in 2006, the major portion of NAIP was acquired with digital sensors which have different footprints than film-based cameras. The Government is considering providing a list of DOQQ deliverables instead of a photo-center file.  What are the potential impacts?
10. Provide standard DEM source: In an effort to reduce contractor?s cost and improve ?repeatable? quality, the Government is considering providing digital elevation models for the orthophoto production process rather than asking for ?best available?. What are the advantages, disadvantages, or risks in providing the DEM as Government-furnished material?

ACQUISITION REQUIREMENTS
11. Elimination of NAPP flight requirements (film-based acquisition): The current NAIP contract requires film-based acquisition to meet very tight specifications (i.e., 1:40,000 scale, pre-determined exposure stations, north-south flight lines) similar to the prior USGS NAPP program. The Government is considering removing flight planning restrictions to allow film-based acquisition more flexibility, while keeping the main focus on the orthophoto end product. How would this change impact the program and/or industry? Would there be a potential cost savings? What risk is involved?
12. Past Performance: To emphasize the importance of meeting FSA?s compliance needs, the Government is considering requiring contractors to provide written proof of poor weather conditions before granting a season extension. Any unverifiable ?acts of God? will be considered an inexcusable delay and will have considerable impact on a contractor?s past performance. What is the minimum data required to support an excusable delay?

PRODUCTION/PRODUCTS
13. Elimination of 2-meter GSD product: Because of the decreasing price gap between 1 and 2-meter imagery FSA is examining potential impacts of having all of NAIP acquired at a 1-meter GSD. How would this ?simplification? and any potential additional processing affect cost/risk?
14. Mosaic compression format: The current NAIP contract requires the compressed county mosaic be delivered in LizardTech?s MrSID format. What are the costs/risks, advantages/disadvantages of moving to a different compression format?
15. Raw image deliverable: There has been interest from NAIP partners to have access to a more ?raw? product in order to further enable digital image enhancement and to preserve image information that can be lost during processing for the compressed county mosaic and quarter quad deliverables. What would be the best footprint and file format for the raw product? What minimum level should the raw product be processed to (i.e. geo-referenced, orthorectifed, etc.)? What raw product from film-based acquisition would be available (i.e. 12-bit scans)? What would be the cost and schedule impacts of providing a deliverable in ?raw? format?
16. 4-band deliverable (digital capture only): The Government has had user interest in a 4-band product (RGB and near infrared). If this becomes a requirement for states acquired with digital sensors, what would be the preferred product format (i.e. a single 4-band or two 3-band product) and why? What are the cost and risk impacts for requiring a 4-band deliverable?  If a single 4-band product is delivered, what would the impacts be regarding quality when deriving separate natural color and color infrared products from the 4-band product post delivery?
17. Faster image delivery for FSA crop compliance: The current NAIP contract is structured to have the compressed county mosaic delivered 30 days after the end of the flying season. Given that flying seasons can typically be 6-8 weeks long, is there a way to deliver imagery faster (web-service, ftp, etc.) for compliance use only (i.e. requiring a ?semi processed? image be delivered within several days after acquisition via electronic transfer)? What would be the additional costs of this deliverable or service?
18. DEM correction deliverable: The Government-furnished elevation model (item #10) should prove suitable for producing orthoimagery to the new accuracy specifications (item #3), but even without these changes, the Government is considering having contractors provide, as a contract deliverable, any corrections made to the DEM. What is the best method for reporting the corrections and what format? What are the cost impacts for requiring this deliverable?
19. Metadata: The current NAIP contract requires the contractor to create FGDC complete metadata from a Government provided template. Is there additional information that is currently not on the template that should be included in the metadata (i.e. DEM source)? Should any of the metadata also be embedded into the imagery?

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in Egypt intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) in anticipation of entering into a contract to implement the Education Technology for Improved Learning Outcomes (TILO) program.    

The objective of this solicitation is to acquire technical assistance and procurement services for implementing a project that uses information technology to improve learning outcomes in select Egyptian schools.  TILO aims at improving student learning outcomes by upgrading the quality of teaching and learning in 202 select K-12 schools in 7 focus governorates in which USAID is already implementing and providing educational reform interventions. In addition, TILO aims to achieve similar goals in 85 Smart Schools.  These are Experimental Preparatory Schools with IT activities being implemented in computer labs and integrating technology in teaching mathematics, science, and English.  The emphasis in the technology interventions in Smart Schools is to acquire proficiency in IT skills compared with a more education-oriented emphasis in the 202 reform schools.
TILO is based on the strong body of evidence that the use of technology in education is successful and effective only when coupled with other education reform efforts such as introduction of child-centered active learning methodologies emphasizing critical thinking skills. The higher level results to be reached at the end of this program include increases in achievement scores measuring conceptual knowledge, practical application, critical thinking and problem solving using active learning methodologies.  These are measured by tools assessing improvements in performance by students in critical thinking and problem solving areas and by measures of teacher and student classroom behavior in participating schools.  These higher level results measure combined effects of technology and other interventions affecting teacher training and student classroom behaviors.  Another result is that 50% of teachers in the Smart Schools succeed in passing 4 of the 7 International Computer Driver License (ICDL) certificate tests.
Some Key features of TILO will include:

(1) Providing state of the art uses of technology in education in Egyptian participating schools aimed at improving learning outcomes and at enriching curriculum with e-content components promoting higher order skills;

(2) Addressing the policy and administrative constraints impeding full use of technology in education; 

(3) Managing, soliciting and awarding an innovation fund, aimed at exploring alternative approaches to resolving technical and other constraints and developing inventive, low cost solutions to the use of technology in education, and 

(4) Engaging local entrepreneurs as Technology Service Providers (TSPs) to perform limited IT training, installation, maintenance, and operations of information technology in schools as an outsourcing of Ministry of Education responsibilities under TILO; and 

(5) Managing and coordinating a public-private-alliance component that allows multinationals and other partners to engage in applying their technological problem-solving skills to the educational challenges in Egypt and to leverage USAID resources in expanding the coverage and beneficiaries of TILO. The alliance component will involve issuing an RFA for soliciting one or more joint alliance activities between several private partners and USAID to achieve these goals.

This is a full and open competition and the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply. The authorized geographic code for this activity is 000 (U.S.).  USAID anticipates awarding a single contract with a period of performance of four years with a total estimated cost ranging from 18 - 21.5 million U.S. Dollars.  The RFP will be posted on the FEDBIZOPPS web page (www.fedbizopps.gov) not less than 45 days after this notice is issued.  In accordance with FAR 5.102(d) availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only.  Requests for other copies of the RFP will be disregarded without notice to the requestor.     No phone requests will be accepted, no RFP will be available for pick-up, and no walk-ins will be allowed.

<DESC>Preparedness for public health threats is a major goal of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). An influenza pandemic has a great potential to cause large numbers of deaths and illnesses over a short time period. A pandemic occurs when there is an antigenic shift in influenza A virus resulting in a new human influenza strain to which most or all of the world's population is susceptible. Three pandemics occurred during the 20th century, the most severe of which, in 1918, caused over 500,000 U.S. deaths and more than 20 million deaths worldwide. Within the scientific community, it is generally believed that the occurrence of another influenza pandemic is highly likely. Recent outbreaks of human disease caused by avian H5, H9, and H7 influenza strains in Asia, Europe, and North America highlight the potential of new strains to be introduced into the population. Estimates for the next pandemic, extrapolating from those of the 20th century, range from about 100,000 to over 2 million deaths in the U.S. alone.  

Influenza vaccines are considered a primary means to decrease the mortality and morbidity associated with the next pandemic.  HHS is pursuing multiple and parallel strategies to close the gap between current influenza vaccine supply and the HHS goal of stockpiling pre-pandemic vaccines as part of the strategic plan for pandemic preparedness.

The Department of Health and Human Services through the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness and Office of Research and Development Coordination contemplates single or multiple awards of contracts to support retrofitting manufacturing facilities for production of pandemic influenza vaccines. The approach may include retrofitting of an existing pilot plant for vaccine seed preparation and/or commercial manufacturing facilities that are currently used to produce Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed biological product for egg-based or cell culture-based bulk production and/or fill finish manufacturing of pandemic influenza vaccines. The scope of activities for which the Offeror may request funds may include conceptual and detailed retrofitting and mechanical engineering design, facility modification and commissioning, facility and manufacturing equipment, and validations of facility/process/systems as required for FDA licensure for manufacturing of influenza vaccines, and warm base operation. Facilities must meet USDA and CDC biosafety containment guidelines for Select Agent usage, WHO recommendations for production of influenza vaccines from reassortants derived from avian influenza viruses, and physical security measured as outlined for BioShield products. The objective of this project is to expand the domestic influenza vaccine supply for influenza pandemic preparedness.  

The anticipated period of performance will be for a total of up to two years.  Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation.  RFP-DHHS-ORDC-VB-06-07 will be available electronically through the FedBizOpps website on or about June 29, 2006 with proposals being due on or about August 14, 2006.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government.  This notice does not commit the Government to the award of a contract.  It is the offerors responsibility to monitor this internet site for the release of this solicitation as well as any amendments.  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and any amendments via this website.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.  See Government Wide Numbered Note 26.  All responses should be identified with RFP No. DHHS-ORDC-VB-06-07, name of company, name of requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, email address and should be submitted to the Contracting Office address identified in this notice.  This solicitation may result in multiple awards.  It is anticipated that an award will be made in 2006.

<DESC>U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) anticipates contracting with Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, 6900 Main Street, Stratford, CT 06614 for Engineering Support Services to be provided with other Government sources in developing information necessary to integrate the Dual Digital Aircraft Flight Control Computer (DDAFCC) into the Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS) cockpit in the MH-60M aircraft fielded for USSOCOM.  The proposed action is for airframe and general aircraft engineers from Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation to provide UH-60X aircraft knowledge to help develop required data reports.  The Government does not have the UH-60X expertise currently to develop these data reports on our own.  Full and open competition can not be permitted since Sikorsky owns the technology in question.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority FAR 6.302-1.  Firms that feel they can provide this deliverable or equal are encouraged to identify themselves.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposal, however, the Government will consider all proposals received by the specified due date (in accordance with FAR 5.203(a)).  A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The estimated release date of the solicitation is 25 October 2006.

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) N61339-05-R-0095 was publicized on the Federal Business Opportunities on 01 September 2005 by the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command Simulation and Training Technology Center  (RDECOM STTC) . This notice calls for White Paper Submissions in reference to the research interest entitled, ?Medical Modeling and Simulation?. Technical Points of Contact for this specific white paper submission: Mr. Jack Norfleet, RDECOM STTC, (407)384-3897, jack.norfleet@us.army.mil or Ms. Michelle Mayo, RDECOM STTC, (407)384-5407, Michelle.L.Mayo@us.army.mil (email contact preferred). Contractual Points of Contact: NAVAIR-Orlando-TSD, Ms. Nikia Jelks, Contract Specialist, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826 or Ms. Vanessa T. Dobson, Procuring Contracting Officer, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826. 

OBJECTIVE: The Severe Trauma Simulation Army Technology Objective (ATO) is researching capabilities to realistically simulate the look, feel, smell, and clinical accuracy of severe trauma for training medics, combat lifesavers and Soldiers.  Severe trauma simulations will be tied to training scenarios appropriate for the current Operational Tempo (OPTEMPO) in the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) and include after action review capabilities.  Each project within this ATO will meet as many of the following conditions as possible:

1.	The simulations shall integrate with any patient simulator or actor to represent the severe trauma injury.
2.	These simulations will benefit by applying technologies from industries outside of typical military training.  (i.e. movie FX, make up artists, material/plastics industry, etc.)
3.	The simulations will have flesh, blood, bone and smells associated with each injury.
4.	The simulations shall be cheaper, more durable and more realistic than current commercial products.
5.	The simulations shall accurately model wounds from a clinical standpoint and shall affect simulated physiology (i.e. measure blood loss and simulate shock symptoms) 
6.	The primary goal is to introduce the physical and psychological barriers that all care givers must overcome before they can successfully treat severely injured soldiers.

BACKGROUND: Blast injuries from roadside and car bombs, rocket-propelled grenades and mortars account for more than half the U.S. combat deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The objective of the Severe Trauma Simulation Army Technology Objective is to research severe trauma simulation technologies to prepare the Army?s Soldiers to deal with the horrific injuries encountered on the battlefield.  Many Soldiers are not prepared to treat such injuries and are thus less effective in the use of their medical skills.  Additionally, battlefield conditions are vastly different from traditional sterile training of the schoolhouse.  Lessons learned from Iraq and Afghanistan show that traditional techniques and procedures for treating injuries can be improved.  For example, field dressings do not stick well to profuse bleeding so Soldiers are improvising in the field at critical times.  Realistic simulated trauma will allow warfighters to master their skills and their equipment before entering the battlefield.  

The planned method for accomplishing the research in this prospective area is to utilize a phased approach.   Therefore, White Papers submitted should be structured so that the technical approach/solution for the proposed research areas address a Basic Award (Phase I) and one (1) priced Option Effort (Phase II) as stated below.  The White Paper must include the anticipated period of performance, a technical description of the proposed concepts, the technical objectives and a planned approach to accomplish the stated objectives as well as a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost.  The ROM cost consists of the total cost plus profit/fee, if any.  

PHASE I.  The Phase I effort will research battlefield injuries and identify materials and technologies to dramatically improve the realism of simulated trauma for training.  Prototypes injuries will be delivered and evaluated against current training methods.  Battlefield injuries such as amputations, eviscerations, blast injuries, burns, orthopedic injuries, compartmentalized injuries, head injuries, penetrations, and blunt force trauma are just a few of the possibilities.  All injuries must address learning objectives and critical skills of care givers.  

Phase I will be a 12-month effort and funding may consist of approximately $250,000 to $750,000.    

PHASE II. The Phase II effort will continue refining the prototype to improve realism, increase ruggedness, improve clinical accuracy, and to address any  shortcomings identified in Phase I.  Severe trauma simulations developed under this phase will be used in the following venues; stand alone, on actors, and on patient simulators.  Designs that accommodate more than one venue are desired.   The specific injuries being simulated will be tracked to learning objectives and critical skills of the Army?s Tactical Combat Casualty Care curriculum. 

Phase II will be a 12-month effort and funding may consist of approximately $500,000.00-800,000.00.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION FOR THIS EFFORT.  DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  

WHITE PAPER SUBMISSION: 

Any responsible offeror capable of satisfying the needs identified in this announcement may submit a white paper. White Paper submissions are encouraged as early as possible but must be received at RDECOM STTC no later than 1600 hrs EDT 14 November 2006. No extensions will be granted. White papers must address requirements for both Phases and shall not exceed 10 pages in length of computerized text at 12-pitchexcluding resumes. Only unclassified white papers will be accepted.  All white papers must include Phase II as a priced option.  The white papers will be reviewed to determine that the proposed effort is within the scope and interest of this solicitation.  A proposal will only be solicited from white papers deemed to best meet the program objectives. White papers will be evaluated by a technical review board using the following criteria listed in descending order of importance: (1) Scientific and Technical Merit: Proposed efforts should create new, or apply existing technology in a new way, that is advantageous to the proposed research topic.  The overall scientific and technical merit of the proposal must be clearly identifiable.  The technical concept should be clearly defined and developed.  Emphasis should be placed on the offeror's technical approach through a comprehensive, logical, orderly, concise, phased plan that indicates major milestones, critical paths, key events, capabilities that can be spun off, demonstration articles, etc.  Consideration should be given to the extent which current State-of-the-Art technology is expanded.    Offeror should discuss how their concept will be documented, demonstrated, or evaluated, and this discussion should be indicative of the understanding of what is required in this program.  (2) Potential Contribution to Military Services Needs and Transition to other Programs: The offeror must adequately address how the proposed program will meet the goal of the research topic.  The proposal must show understanding of the potential approach and make a compelling case for the viability of the proposed effort.  The relevance is further indicated by the offeror's understanding of the operating environment of the product or demonstration (current Military or Industrial technical problems/issues, limitations, etc.).  The relationships of the proposed effort with other ongoing or anticipated initiatives (military or civilian) that are focused on improving the Medical Modeling and Simulation should be considered.  Offeror should recognize and identify potential strategies for transitioning technology within the DoD.  Plans on how offeror intends to get developed technology, and information on these developments, to the user community should be considered. (3) Personnel: The qualifications, experience, capabilities, and demonstrated achievements of the proposed principal investigators and other key personnel for the primary and subcontractor organizations should be examined and assessed for the proposal objectives.
 (4) Corporate Capabilities and Facilities: Offerors are required to describe their relevant capabilities and accomplishments.  The offeror must have a demonstrated capability to conceptualize, develop theories, identify concept deficiencies, analyze, and develop mature concepts for rapid application/ demonstration.  Consider the offeror?s history of related work.  Also consider any unique facilities or equipment that the offeror possesses.
  (5) Cost: The overall estimated cost to accomplish the effort should be considered as well as the substantiation of the costs for the technical complexity described.  Evaluation should consider the extent to which the proposed management plan will effectively allocate and provide accounting of funds, equipment, and personnel, select subprojects, monitor and evaluate the program to achieve the proposed objectives, and respond to contingencies created by unanticipated technical barriers or breakthroughs.
Cost reasonableness and realism will be assessed, but this assessment is of a lower priority than the technical evaluation.   White Papers found to be consistent with the requirements of this announcement and deemed to best meet the program objectives may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  To be eligible for award a white paper must be submitted. Offerors will be notified whether or not their white paper was favorably received on or about 20 November 2006. Favorable review of a white paper does not constitute selection of the proposed effort for contract award and will not establish a binding commitment for the Government to fund the effort in whole or part. Upon notification, the Government will issue a request for proposal letter to the qualified offeror(s), who best meet the program objectives. If proposals are solicited, proposals are due NLT 15 December 2006.  The requirements for proposal preparation and submission can be found at http://www.peostri.army.mil/BAA/home.jsp.

This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the government to reimburse any proposal preparation cost for responding. The cost of proposal preparation in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect costs as specified in FAR 31.205-18.

<DESC>THIS IS ONLY THE ADVANCED NOTICE.  THE SOLICITAION WILL BE POSTED AFTER NOVEMBER 1, 2006 FOR THE WORK DESCRIBED IN THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. 1-1 Purpose The National Park Service (NPS) seeks to re-roof the low slope roof on the Lynch & Kennedy Building's east elevation in the Klondike National Historical Park.  The National Park Service will provide rehabilitation drawings of the building which contain the original construction documents for this particular roof. The licensed and bonded contractor will be responsible for the removal and disposal of the existing roof and associated elements and the construction of the new roof including all labor and materials.  The contractor shall provide the necessary submittals for review and approval by the NPS. 1-2 Background The Lynch & Kennedy Building was restored in 1991.  The low slope roof covers a non-historic portion of the building which adjoins the L & K with the historic Pack Train building.   The existing roof has a slope of ":12 which has failed at the eave and has caused deterioration to the exterior walls and interior spaces below.  The failure may be attributed in part to the quantity of the Pack Train's roof runoff which has drained directly onto the low slope roof for 15 years.  The NPS has been given permission to install and maintain a 5" gutter on the Pack Train's south elevation.  The gutter work will be accomplished by the NPS and will not be included in this contract.  Part II: Site Analysis/Design Programming 2-1 Orientation ***SITE VISIT WILL BE SCHEDULED AND ANNOUNCED WHEN THE SOLICITATION IS POSTED AFTER NOVEMBER 1, 2006.*** A general orientation to the project is necessary to become familiar with the existing NPS facilities and design requirements.  Following the site orientation, it is anticipated that the contractor will have all the necessary information to adequately bid the project and/or recommend any design alternatives.   Specifically, this phase includes: A. Review of government furnished material to develop an understanding of the project history and proposed development actions. B. On-site inspection of the existing conditions to become familiar with the existing NPS facilities and operations. C. Discussion of materials to be used, anticipated challenges or possible changes to the Scope of Work due to unforeseen conditions.   ALL VENDORS WISHING TO BE CONSIDERED FOR THIS SOLICITATION MUST BE REGISTERED IN THE CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (CCR) DATABASE PRIOR TO AN AWARD BEING MADE.

<DESC>The Division of AIDS (DAIDS), of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking an organization to continue the Immunology Quality Assessment Program. 

Currently, the IQA Program serves approximately 85 U.S. and 60 non-U.S. laboratories.  With the growing number of NIAID studies in the developing world, it is expected that the IQA Program will expand to evaluate the ability of approximately 125 U.S. and 100 non-U.S. flow cytometry laboratories to adequately enumerate CD4-positive T Cells and to provide laboratory assistance and training.  This potential increase will be accommodated by the exercise of contract options.  U.S. and non-US laboratories supported by the IQA Program shall hereinafter be referred to as Sites.

Several NIAID programs and Study Groups have been served by this resource. Groups that will be supported by this resource include: the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG); the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT); the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN); the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN); Microbicide Trials Network (MTN) (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/news/newsreleases/2006/leadership.htm); the Women and Infants Transmission Study (WITS); the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS); the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS); the Comprehensive International Program of Research on AIDS (CIPRA); the Acute Infection and Early Disease Research Program (AIEDRP); and individual grantees (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/about/organization/daids/). In addition, the contract shall serve as a resource to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Global AIDS Program (GAP)-affiliated laboratories supporting the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) activities http://www.cdc.gov/nchstp/od/gap/default.htm.

The scope of activities to be carried out under this contract include: 1) design and execute proficiency testing programs to externally assess the ability of U.S. and non-U.S. DAIDS-support clinical trial sites (hereinafter referred to as Sites) to reliably: 1) perform immunological assays (e.g., T-cell subsets and other cytometry-based tests); 2) provide assistance and training to laboratories that are not performing according to established standards, especially to flow cytometry laboratories in non-U.S. resource limited countries; 3) conduct or support comparative evaluations of instruments, methods and reagents; 4) facilitate the development, standardization and assay characterization of new immunological assays, and of cheaper simpler methods to measure CD4, for implementation in multi-center investigations; and 5) evaluate the ability of Sites to adequately freeze viable peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for future immunological tests.  

To accomplish these aims, the Contractor must:  a) have access to a wide range of infected and non-infected  donors to obtain human biological materials (e.g. plasma, PBMC, tissue); b) prescreen potential donors for existence of required characteristics (e.g. CD4 count, viral load level, HLA type, antigen response, vaccine titer); c) create panels of samples (coded when used for proficiency testing purposes), including replicates to assess within- and inter-laboratory variability; d) provide data management and statistical analysis capability; e) provide staff and facilities for on-site and off-site training; f) provide  the facilities to store samples and reagents; and g) ship and track samples and reagents.  In addition, the IQA laboratory shall be Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified, conducting operations in accordance with Good Clinical Laboratory Practices (GCLP), and have local Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval for its activities.

Three options, that may be exercised at the discretion of the Government, shall provide for expansion of the IQA Program to additional U.S. and non-U.S. Sites as follows:

Option 1  CD4 Proficiency Testing Program:  Addition of U.S. and Canadian Sites only to the CD4 Proficiency Testing Program.

Option 2  United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Service (UK NEQAS) Proficiency Testing Program:  Addition of non-U.S. Sites participating in the UK NEQAS CD4 proficiency testing program.

Option 3  Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) Cryopreservation Proficiency Testing Program:  Addition of U.S. and non-U.S. Sites to the PBMC cryopreservation proficiency testing program.

The incumbent contractor is the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.  It is anticipated that a cost-reimbursement, incrementally funded, completion form contract will be awarded for 7 years with options to potentially increase support to additional sites over the life of the contract.  The Government considers the effort to be approximately 6 Full Time Equivalents (FTEs), per year.  The RFP will be available on November 3.   This RFP will be available electronically on the NIAID Office of Acquisitions home page:  http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract and the Federal Business Opportunities web site:  http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.   Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government.   This announcement does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.   No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.   See Government-wide numbered note 26.

<DESC>This activity will build on successful prior USAID assistance developing market value chains in the agricultural sector to include other non-agricultural sectors such as tourism and handicrafts.  Specifically, whereas USAID has successfully supported the development of the Haitian agricultural export industry for a number of years and has  also supported the handicraft sector under a another separate initiative, its support for market value chain development will now be carried out across all sectors where there is the most potential for local, regional and export value-added.  The intent is to gain economies of scale and synergy by combining all value chain analysis and strengthening into a single market-oriented activity.

The performance-based Contract to be awarded will aim to increase the numbers of Haitians involved in sustainable economic activities and the income derived therefrom.   As a result of this activity, USAID expects to see increased incomes, increased trade and investment in selected market chains; increased sustainable livelihood options, and better management of natural resources (particularly soil) by way of increased value of environmentally friendly (non-erosive) products.  The MarChE Project is expected to work in tandem to the maximum extent feasible with other ongoing and planned USAID development activities.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command intends to issue a cost-plus-fixed-fee delivery order to the Boeing Company under Basic Ordering Agreement N00019-05-G-0026. The delivery order to Boeing is for development and design of a vibration-isolated mounting tray assembly for the AN/APN-194 Radar Altimeter.  The solution requires an immediate design & productionization plan for forward fit and retrofit of the new mounting tray into F/A-18E/F and E/A-18G aircraft.  The vibration-isolated tray assembly design will be based on the current Boeing design and will need to meet or exceed the platform-unique environmental requirements of the F/A-18E/F and E/A-18G.  The Boeing Company as the designer, developer, and sole manufacturer of the Radar Altimeter Mounting Assembly is the only known source available to provide the required effort in the requisite time frame.

The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Throughout the region, J4 USSOUTHCOM in collaboration wit h local, national, regional, international, governmental and non-governmental organizations are working together to improve the host nations disaster response capabilities.  This has been accomplished by increasing the capacity and regional infrastructure of host nations through support of established Regional Emergency Management Mechanisms.

This fraction of the program is also tailored to help partner nations; particularly those that have been affected by disaster or hardship, to improve healthcare, education and ensuring sustainable commu nity development. The ultimate goal is to build the capacity of community members in order to meet existing and future challenges and mitigate the need for U.S. assistance.

<DESC>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source Pikes Peak Center (Doing business as Colorado Springs World Arena) for leasing a performance location for use by the USAF Academy Band under the authority of FAR 13.106.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 48 Hours after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally by considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Sole Source is based upon the sole source justification document below.  


SUBJECT:  Sole Source Justification 

1.  Agency Identification:  This is a Justification and Approval for the sole source rental of the Pikes Peak Center for The USAF Academy Band.  This acquisition is being requested by The USAF Academy Band and supported by the 21st Contracting Squadron at Peterson AFB.

2. Nature and Description of the Action Being Approved:  The USAF Academy Band performs several public concerts in Colorado Springs each year in support of the community relations mission.  In order to fulfill this mission, a concert hall must be procured.  The best venue to meet our needs is the Pikes Peak Center.

3.  Description of the Supplies or Services:  2006 and 2007 Performance dates are as follows:     

28 Oct 06 ? Performance		
11 Dec 06 - Concert Band load-in and rehearsal
12 Dec 06 ? Evening Performance
13 Dec 06 ? Evening Performance
11 Feb 07 - Performance
4 Mar 07 ? Performance
22 Apr 07 - Performance
14 May 07 - Concert Band load-in and rehearsal
15 May 07 - Concert Band performance - Armed Forces Week concert

Expected total cost is $.  Please see Statement of Work for further details.


4.  Statutory Authority:  Lieutenant General Rosa, Superintendent, the United States Air Force Academy mandated this venue.  Included in this request are provisions for lighting, sound, facility rental, ticket printing, stagehands, and operational staff necessary to support this event.  Requested venue is the Pikes Peak Center, Colorado Springs, CO.  Phone: (719) 477-2101.  POC:  Ms. Dorothea Lischick.  Email:  dlischick@worldarena.com

5.  Unique Qualifications:  As Commander of The USAF Academy Band, I have been directed by Lieutenant General Rosa, Superintendent of The United States Air Force Academy to hold our 2006 concerts at the Pikes Peak Center in order to alleviate security and audience transportation concerns that make using the Academy?s Arnold Hall unusable for our specific needs.  The Pikes Peak Center is the only local venue available that can offer size, acoustics and logistical support for events of this magnitude.  Therefore, we request only the Pikes Peak Center be considered for award of this contract

6.  Description of Efforts Made to Solicit Many Potential Sources:  Our knowledge of concert halls in the local area is complete.  Since there is only one that meets our needs, the selection process was simple.

7.  Statement of Determination of Fair and Reasonable:  (To be completed by the Contracting Specialist) 

8.  Description of Market Research Conducted:  It is essential that The United States Air Force Academy Band and the United States Air Force produce the highest quality community-relations performances possible.  The Pikes Peak Center possesses all the equipment, experience, acoustic properties and unsurpassed first-hand knowledge necessary to accomplish musical performances in a world-class manner, within the price point specified by our budget.  The Pikes Peak Center is uniquely qualified to hold our events because it is the only acoustically viable venue large enough to handle the 2000 plus audience attendees (per concert) within the Colorado Springs area.  Last year (2006), The USAF Academy Band delighted over 12,500 audience members in four concerts that ensured a continued strong bond between our military members and the local community.  The intent of our 2007 concert series is to increase USAF Academy and Air Force community-relations initiatives by performing seven local concerts at the preferred Colorado Springs music performance venue the Pikes Peak Center.  Performing our concerts at the Pikes Peak Center will reduce logistics and security concerns and offer a better concertgoer?s experience when compared to using the USAF Academy?s Arnold Hall Theater.  The Pikes Peak Center?s unique auditory and seating capabilities will undoubtedly leave our audiences with a lasting impression of the professionalism and readiness of the USAF Academy and our Air Force.  Our organization has done extensive research to find a concert hall that is acoustically viable and has an audience capacity of at least 2200.  The geographic front-range area includes three acceptable facilities.  In addition to the Pikes Peak Center, two other halls with acceptable acoustics and seating are located in Denver and Greeley.  Boettcher Hall (POC Mr. Drew Armstrong 303-640-2637) is the facility in Denver.  Monfort Hall Union Colony Center is in Greeley (POC June Lindenmeyer 970-350-9460).  While the other facilities also meet our minimum seating and acoustical needs, they cannot support the more than 500,000 El Paso County residents who live too far away to attend Academy Band concerts at these venues.

Description
The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is surveying the market to determine potential sources qualified to perform JPATS Ground Based Training System (GBTS) Contractor Logistics Support (CLS).  We anticipate a 5 to 10 year contract with support beginning on 01 July 2007.

Anticipated Acquisition Schedule: 
Draft RFP Release                              September 06
Presolicitation Conference                     September 06

BACKGROUND

GBTS was developed and procured as part of the JPATS program with Raytheon Aircraft Corporation (RAC) as the prime contractor.  RAC is currently providing GBTS CLS and is responsible for integration of the T-6A aircraft with GBTS.  The GBTS and associated CLS was developed to support training operations for the maximum student and instructor training load at each training site. The GBTS has three major functional areas:  Courseware, Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs), and the Training Integration Management System (TIMS).

There are five different types of Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs) in training operations.  Three of these are Flight Training Devices used to teach students normal and emergency procedures as defined in the Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) syllabus.  All three utilize the same Central Training Complex (CTC).  This includes a full functioning replica of the T-6 front seat cockpit and the same Instructor Operating Station (IOS).  Each simulator has no motion.  Each has five PC computers that run the IOS, the host, the flight deck I/O, the aural cueing system and the electronic control loading.  The primary difference in the devices is the level of corresponding visual system.  The Unit Training Device (UTD) has no visual system.  The Instrument Flight Trainer (IFT) has a 45 X 33 degree visual and the Operational Flight Trainer has a 270 X 70 degree visual.  Both use the same visual databases and a common Vital 9 or 10 Visual Control Computer and Image Generator.  Both also use forward projection Barco CRT projectors.  The IFT uses one and the OFT uses five.

The other two ATDs are used for teaching emergency and ground egress and include the Egress Procedures Trainer (EPT) and the Ejection Seat Trainer (EST).  The EPT replicates the forward cockpit of the T-6A with non-functioning instruments and a moving stick and throttle.  It also has a canopy that replicates the opening forces of the A/C.  The EST is a standalone mock-up of the A/C ejection seat and allows the student to practice strap-in and ejection procedures.  A student is given an aural indication when ejection has been properly initiated.

The Courseware consists of Developed and Standardized courses and their associated syllabi.  The T-6 Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) student, T-6 Pilot Instructor Training (PIT) and admin courseware (which teaches users how to use the GBTS) are developed courseware.  The courseware was developed using Authorware.  Standardized courses include courseware for other undergraduate training platforms.

TIMS was designed to manage all Air Force and Navy undergraduate flying training programs (T-6, T-37, T-1A, T-38C, T-34, TH-57, etc.)  TIMS operates on Windows 2000 clustered servers, SQL 2000 databases and Windows XP clients.  Portions of TIMS, developed with Microsoft .NET, require an application server.  The core TIMS development environment includes Microsoft Visual Studio .NET (Visual Basic, C++, C# and Java).        

CURRENT ENVIRONMENT

RAC is currently responsible for integration of all GBTS components.

On-Site ATD support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB, and NAS Pensacola.  At the Air Force locations, the contractor provides required manning, spare parts, and support equipment to meet mission effectiveness of 95%.  There are financial penalties for not meeting the mission effectiveness.  The Government does not own ATD spares at Air Force Locations.  At the Navy location, the contractor provides manning, support equipment and replenishes Government owned spare parts.  Maintenance actions and spare parts usage are tracked using Magic Service Desk.

On-Site TIMS Computer Aided Instruction (CAI) support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB, Columbus AFB, Vance AFB and Sheppard AFB.  Each of these locations has CLS for the CAI labs and a Helpdesk (takes and responds to calls and walk-ins, enters trouble tickets, performs system administration and database administration, etc.).

Randolph AFB has one CAI lab in bldg. 740
Moody AFB has two CAI labs in bldg. 709
Laughlin AFB has two CAI labs (one right above the other) in bldg. 328
Columbus AFB has two CAI labs in bldg. 230 and 268
Vance AFB has two labs in CAI bldg. 672
Sheppard AFB has one CAI labs in bldg. 2320

Randolph AFB is the central site for the Modification and Update Support System (MUSS) which makes changes and distributes these changes to other GBTS locations.  The MUSS supports:
ATD software and visual database maintenance
Developed courseware (i.e. CAI Graphics, Test Bank Questions, Syllabus Management)
Standardized courseware integration, quality checks, syllabus management and distribution
TIMS software maintenance (additional support provided at contractor location)
Systems and Sustaining engineering (support provided at contractor location)


FOLLOW-ON CLS CHALLENGES AND EXPECTATIONS

The required support will not include on-site ATD maintenance support for the Navy.  Excluding the Navy sites, the total support provided will be no less than the support described in the current environment above.  Support will be required to integrate T-6 and ATD production changes into the fielded GBTS.  TIMS MUSS support will require Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Level 3 certification as a minimum.  The contract type is anticipated to be fixed price with some T&M effort.

Interested sources should submit information that describes in-house capability and what might be subcontracted.  Provide experience and knowledge of:
1.  Simulator support
2.  Courseware support
3.  Training management systems and IT systems administration
4.  Software certification level
5.  Undergraduate/graduate flying training

If you have already responded to a prior sources sought announcement for this effort, updates may be submitted to address any changes contained herein.  Any comments to the documents for this effort may be addressed to the contracts representative, Ms. Lisa Adams, Lisa.Adams@wpafb.af.mil, or Ms. Michelle Hendricks, Michelle.Hendricks@wpafb.af.mil.

PROGRAMMATICS: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his/her concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition into the proper channels. The Ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern when requested by the offeror. The Ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process for this acquisition. The Ombudsman is Col Robert Catlin, (310) 653-2138.

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to notify interested parties of the upcoming AT21 Pre-Solicitation Conference and to provide instructions for requesting subsequent one-on-one industry sessions. The AT21 Pre-Solicitation Conference will be held on Tuesday, 31 Oct 2006 from 1:30 to 5:00 P.M. at the Four Point Sheraton Conference Center, 319 Fountains Parkway, Fairview Heights, Illinois.  The conference is being conducted to provide interested parties the opportunity to improve their understanding of the government's requirements, to identify and resolve concerns regarding the acquisition strategy, to assess the suitability of the proposal instructions and evaluation criteria, including the approach for assessing past performance information, and to address any other industry concerns or questions. 

The following agenda for the AT21 Pre-Solicitation Conference is provided:

1.   Welcome/Introductions
2.   AT21 Program Overview
3.   Solicitation Review
4.   Small Business Goals and Objectives
5.   Requirements Briefing
6.   Question/Answer Session

USTRANSCOM will host subsequent one-on-one sessions with potential offerors to provide them an opportunity to address any specific areas of concern in regards to the release of the final AT21 solicitation.  The one-on-one sessions will not be a forum to market company specific capabilities or for vendors to obtain information that has not been shared with industry. Sessions will be strictly limited to 30 minutes and will be scheduled on a first-come, first-serve basis.

The one-on-one sessions will be held 01-03 November 2006 at the The MITRE Corporation, Lakepointe Centre Professional Park, 1662 Windham Way, O?Fallon, IL  62269.  To schedule a one-on-one session, please e-mail your company name and point of contact information to Ms. Terri Francoeur at terri.francoeur@ustranscom.mil and Michael Pardue at michael.pardue@ustranscom.mil no later than 25 Oct 2006.  Specific questions can be directed to Ms. Francoeur and Mr. Pardue at 618-256-4300. Due to space limitations, a maximum of ten company (10) representatives will be allowed to participate. Please note that your participation in the one-on-one sessions will be at your company's expense. USTRANSCOM will not provide any reimbursement for costs incurred in travel or other expenses. Further, the government may use any information provided during the one-on-one sessions to complete market research. We highly recommend you not discuss any information you deem as competitive sensitive or proprietary. If you choose to provide written documentation to support your discussion, recommend you identify all sensitive information, such as corporate proprietary information, and state the appropriate restrictions in the evaluation and use of the information provided.  USTRANSCOM appreciates your participation in this acquisition.

The following is a brief synopsis of the AT21 requirement:  

Agile Transportation for the 21st Century will identify and implement business processes and systems that enable USTRANSCOM?s distribution planning, transportation planning, and transportation execution activities in support of the DOD distribution enterprise. This effort will apply best business practices and leverage order management and transportation management technologies; enhance supply chain capabilities resulting in reduced deployment and distribution cycle times, increased customer satisfaction via tailored distribution support, and reduced customer wait time; and, achieve of an environment that provides asset visibility throughout the supply chain and leads to decreased materiel costs.

The effort will focus less on capturing the ?as-is? processes and more on providing a solution ?blueprint? that best meets the program objectives (mission capability and performance), addressing and integrating the myriad of enterprise-wide elements including: organization, culture, personnel competency, business processes, facilities and assets, and enabling information technology. The ultimate solution should define and enable end-to-end integrated processes to achieve transformational impact, rather than applying technology to existing processes for incremental improvement. 

This requirement will be managed in increments as shown below.  Initiation of each increment is not necessarily dependent on the completion of the previous increment.  

Increment	Description
I	Requirements Consolidation and Workflow Management
II	Strategic-Level Optimization and Scheduling
III	Operational-Level Optimization and Scheduling
Post Incr III	Post Increment 3 Support

Specific AT21 requirements will be identified in the Capability Development Document (CDD) and in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) to be included in the upcoming draft solicitation expected to be released the week of October 16, 2006.

For planning purposes, request all interested parties e-mail their company name and an estimated number of attendees to Terri Francoeur at terri.francoeur@ustranscom.mil and Michael Pardue at michael.pardue@ustranscom.mil  no later than Wednesday 25 Oct 2006.

<DESC>This is an update to the notices N00019-06-P7-ZD180 and N00019-06-R-0052, posted on 24 March 20006 and 28 June 2006, respectively.  The Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) Program is being transitioned to the Navy Unmanned Combat Air Systems (N-UCAS) Program.  The N-UCAS Advanced Development Program Office (ADPO) has a requirement to develop and demonstrate technologies and operational concepts that will provide effective, affordable, survivable, and supportable Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle (UCAV) systems.  In support of this requirement, the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to hold a limited competition to develop, build and test an aircraft carrier (CV) based Unmanned Combat Air System (UCAS) Demonstration System.  Participants will be limited to the current J-UCAS sources, which are: The McDonnell Douglas Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Boeing Company (Boeing); and the Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation (Northrop).  Boeing and Northrop are the only known responsible sources with the required technical expertise to satisfy the Government?s requirements.  Award to any source other than current J-UCAS participants would result in substantial duplication of costs that would not be recovered through full and open competition.  The Demonstration System effort will be structured to mature critical technologies and reduce risk for aircraft carrier integration of an operationally relevant UCAS with a Low Observable (LO) planform.  The UCAS demonstration shall include, but is not limited to, Carrier Control Approach (CCA) operations, launch and recovery, deck operations and supportability.  Activities will focus towards a suitability demonstration of a relevant LO planform aboard ship no later than 2013.  The UCAS demonstration system will include an Air Vehicle (AV) and Mission Control System (MCS) design approach.  All correspondence and Request for Proposal will be posted to the NAVAIR website at http://www.navair.navy.mil (select Doing Business and then select Open Solicitations).  To date, no other company has expressed an interest in the Navy UCAS requirement.  A formal Request For Proposal (RFP) is planned to be released in late November 2006.  All questions and correspondence regarding this synopsis shall be sent to the Contracting Officer.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to the synopsis issued on 18 Oct 2006 is to delete any reference to a "dynamic positioning system:"  The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to award a sole-source contract to MacGregor (USA) Inc., 14 Ridgedale Ave, Suite 205, Cedar Knolls, NJ 07927-1106 (RFP N00024-07-R-2214) for the development and production of a prototype side port ramp for the Maritime Pre-positioning Force (Future) (MPF(F)) Mobile Landing Platform (MLP) with an integrated side port platform for the MPF(F) Large Medium-Speed Roll-on/Roll-off (LMSR). The effort will include technology development and testing of one new MLP side port ramp integrated with the side port platforms for the MPF(F) LMSR and existing Army LMSRs. The MLP Ramp and LMSR Platform will be an extension of new technologies using the existing stern ramp system from the Military Sealift Commands T-AKR Class (LMSR). The design concept will facilitate the transfer of vehicles between the Mobile Landing!   Platform (MLP) and existing and future LMSRs. The design will consist of a smaller version of the Army LMSRs stern ramp mounted on the starboard side of the MLP, which will be deployed to a new platform that folds out from the port side of the LMSR. The system will operate through sea-state 3 conditions with a maximum load capacity 160,000 pounds. The new side platform will be about 48 feet wide and 56 feet long which will be larger than the existing LMSR side platform while still stowing with the same side shell recess and mounts. When deployed, the platform will be angled about 5 degrees below horizontal supported by hinged links at the fore and aft ends. The MLP ramp and LMSR platform will require detailed knowledge and familiarity with critical technical details, design, configuration, and performance characteristics of previously produced ramps and doors. In addition, commonality with existing (Army) LMSR ships is essential. MacGregor USA is the only company maintain!  ing the necessary familiarity with prior LMSR ramp/door designs; desig n systems; and, production processes to successfully execute this effort. Therefore, MacGregor USA is deemed the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the Governments requirements. Firms interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact MacGregor USA directly as follows: POC: Jeffrey Siegel (jeff.siegel@macgregor-group.com), (973) 285-7874 (office), (914) 439-3662 (cell), (973) 285-7861 (fax)..

<DESC>This is amendment 5 to the RFP.  Its purpose is to post RFP questions received from potential offerors and the Government's responses.  Note that the Government did receive additional questions that are not being posted.  These questions either identified the offeror or may have asked for clarification about the size of company that can respond to this full and open competition.  These questions received direct responses. It was determined that the responses did not provide the offerors with any competitive advantage.  Likewise, offerors not receiving these responses will not be at a competitive disadvantage.  

Q1. In reference to Section H.6 1352.237-73 KEY PERSONNEL (MARCH
2000) of the RFP, the Contractor shall assign to this contract the following Key Personnel: TO BE DETERMINED.  While we have several engineers who may be assigned to this effort if awarded, as the work will occur at some future TBD point, knowing precisely which engineer will handle the work is impossible. It is not clear from the RFP what the ramifications are if we later remove personnel listed from the effort. We understand we need to notify the government, but what are the government's legal choices in this case, for example can NOAA cancel the R&D contract if it wishes? (Practical examples include a key employee leaves the company or they get assigned to work on a different internal R&D program). Please advise why this list of key personnel is necessary and how it gets weighted on the overall score. Also, related question: Are time sheets required as backup to prove who-worked-on-what-when? In audits for CPFF type contract instruments this is often required.

A1.  The purpose of this clause is to make sure that the main or key personnel assigned to this contract have the capability to perform.  The Government wants to be notified if a key individual is replaced so they know who is working on the contract.  If a change in personnel needs to be made during contract performance, the Government wants to be assured that a suitable substitute key person is provided.  If an inadequate replacement is named and no acceptable replacement can be identified, the Government may be justified in terminating the contract. The evaluation criteria does not include a separate Key Personnel factor.  However, the evaluation of personnel will be included in the review of FACTOR 1:  TECHNICAL QUALIFICATIONS and FACTOR 3: CORPORATE EXPERIENCE.  The SEB will review the capabilities of the key individuals proposed in terms of how well the proposal demonstrates their abilities to perform the functions listed in "a" through "j" of Section L.2 PROPOSAL PREPARATION.  In paragraph 1 of Section M.1 EVALUATION CRITERIA of the RFP, it lists the evaluation criteria and states that the criteria are listed in order of importance.  "Technical Qualifications toward meeting or exceeding the UDS Specifications" is listed first and is therefore considered the most important.  Scores for this factor will be more heavily weighted than other factors. The Government has determined that contract performance requires identification of contractor key personnel.  Therefore, this DOC local clause has been included in the contract. Time sheets are not required as backup.  The resulting contract type will be firm fixed price. Also note that if key personnel change during the proposal period, offerors need to inform the Government and obtain approval of the replacement.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The second question references 52.219-8  UTILIZATION OF SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS (MAY 2004) and M.1  1352.215-76 EVALUATION CRITERIA (MARCH 2000) of the RFP.  

Q2: We understand this is not a "small business set aside" contract as
the government previously conducted limited research and determined that there was not more than one small business concern capable of meeting the needs of the RFP. However, are small business concerns given any advantage to larger business bidders on the RFP? If "no", how does NOAA reconcile the inclusion of this clause in the contract (that is, why is it included)?  Further, if "yes", what is the additional weighting afforded to being a small business, thus allowing NOAA to help meet its agency obligations under clause 52.219? 1352.215-76 makes no mention of this and we are hypothesizing OMB requires this clause in all contracts, but it seems to be contradictory.

A2:  No advantage will be given to small businesses within this full-and-open competitive environment.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The third question references VOLUME II COST/PRICE PROPOSAL:  
 
(B)  Prices.  The Government expects that this contract will be awarded
based upon adequate price competition.  The Government has $200,000
budgeted for this requirement.  However, in order for the Government to
determine that prices are fair and reasonable, Offerors shall provide a
cost breakdown of labor and materials that supports your fixed price. 

Q3: "Is this a cost ceiling of $200,000? For the development scope
described this seems low. For example, our firm just completed a two
year $375K NOAA Phase I/II effort that involved the R&D of only a
lightweight dropsonde (what the RFP calls the UDS) and receiver (what
the RFP calls the ORDP). And that effort was also heavily subsidized
internally, so the true cost was more like $500K. We do feel that a
release mechanism alone is feasible for $200K, but can you comment on
how much additional funds would be available beyond $200K, or what the
weighting is on bid cost (beyond simply 'best value' guidelines?)" 

A3:  The Government's current budget is $200,000.  Any proposal over the $200,000 is made at the offeror's risk.  Remember that this is a best value decision.  Though the Government budget is small for this effort, the delivery of a successful prototype will entice the Government to obtain a budget for deployment of the Ultra-light dropsonde system in the field.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q4: Related question to Q3: "Are bidders considered unresponsive if
they propose more than $200K?"

A4:  See answer provided above in "A3."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q5: It is very helpful to know a superpressure balloon will be used for testing, this makes practical sense. Can we assume that the balloon will be used for fair weather soundings only? Obviously we cannot use a balloon drifting to test in a hurricane, as the winds will be divergent, even at 80K ft (re: Alan G., NOAA Air Operations Center, and Terry Hock, NCAR, personal communications.) 
A5:  Balloon flights for testing will be conducted in eastern Colorado during daylight hours with early morning launches.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q6: Will a parachute be used to control decent from the super pressure balloon? If so, will it be similar to the patented parachutes used by existing dropsondes and will the government provide those parachutes? (Reason: the four sided parachutes are protected by patent and are only available from the vendor that licensed them from NCAR ... and to the best of our knowledge this vendor does not sell them separately from their dropsonde, which they also licensed from NCAR). 
A6:  The descent phase of testing using balloons will employee standard parachutes.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q7: In the response it is stated that the dropsonde release mechanism will not be a component of the effort. Will the government be developing this technology on its own or will the R&D of that element potentially become a separate R&D contract? If so, how will dropsonde flight testing be conducted and the contract completed, if the government-developed dropsonde release mechanism is not ready on time? If, as the RFP asserts, both chamber testing and flight testing will be required, it seems that the R&D of the release mechanism ought to be tied together contractually, no? Would the government consider separating flight testing into a separate effort? 
A7:  Government plans concerning the ?dropsonde release mechanism? are not firm at this time.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q8: In response to sensor accuracy questions, we see the statement "the government expects the RFP specs to be met." Unfortunately, what is desired for sensor accuracy in the RFP and what is practical to build with sensor components that can be procured at reasonable cost, that work over the wide 200F temperature dynamic range are divergent. We understand that an on board pressure measurement in a hurricane will be needed (as opposed to GPS attitude-derived pressure). However, we respectfully ask the government to include explicit language in the contract that these specification are a "best effort" instead of "must be met".  (Reason: we own a high altitude simulation chamber, and measuring pressure to 0.1hPa over a -100 to +100F range is currently beyond the current state-of-the-art with disposable/expendable sensor technology.) We suggest that the NOAA hurricane forecast center end customers be asked to qualify their sensitivity/resolution parameter requirements with respect to model accuracy, as we suspect there are not hard drivers for these PTU specifications.  
A8:  As stated earlier, the Government expects the requirements of the RFP to be met.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q9: The RFP states that we need a 90% data success rate and mentions that we cannot have more than 3% contiguous drop outs in data packets. So if we lost GPS satellite lock for a 3 second period out of the entire flight and stopped sending position data, the whole flight will fail given this criteria. If we had data every five seconds is that sufficient? Can you explain why the contiguous drop out spec is a requirement and why these particular limits were chosen?  Further, do all 12 prototypes need to pass the same requirement? In our experience, GPS signal propagation is somewhat indeterminate and somewhat beyond one's control at times due to space weather effects, etc. Suppose in a 10 second interval where we have the first two seconds successful, followed by five dead seconds, followed by three seconds of data ... can you elaborate more about the time granularity. 
A9:  If your design will not provide reliable tracking, your proposal should indicate the frequency of this occurrence and provide details of how your processing system will deal with it.  The data requirement is given in the RFP.  The ?drop out spec? is a requirement to insure the integrity of the collected data set and the limits were chosen for the convenience of the government.  All of the equipment to be delivered has to meet the applicable requirements of the RFP.  The RFP specifications will provide the ?time granularity? desired by the Government. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Q10: In order to meet the stringent PTU sensor specifications we need to know the exact technology the referees will use for referee environmental sensors, both in the test chambers and on the superpressure balloon. Will the environmental sensors pressure/humidity/temperature providing truth data for the superpressure balloon during flight testing use aspirated air temperature sensors such as PRTs? Will the humidity data truth sensor be a chilled mirror hygrometer? Will the pressure data truth sensor be a heated compensated aneroid barometer? etc. We need to understand the time constants and other factors such that we can be assured that our disposable PTU sensors will agree with the data truth sensors on the balloon package within spec. 
A10:  The sensor set used for testing will be based on Vaisala RS-80 radiosonde sensor technology with a digital data logger attached.  Prior to testing, the sensor set will be compared with laboratory standard measurements to determine bias so that this bias can be adjusted for in the testing.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q11: We asked about whether the temperature specification will need to be met if our dropsonde thermistor sensor becomes wet and experiences evaporative cooling. The government said essentially, "yes, under conditions that it would normally experience." This is a major issue and a known problem with existing RD-93 dropsondes which have a negative bias when wet, of more than a degree or so.  Because this is far in excess of the RFP's target temperature spec, we wonder how this can be achieved with present technology? This is a physics problem. Certainly, a dropsonde will get wet in a hurricane, but how can this be dealt with in meeting the spec? Would the government be willing to adjust the spec to be under "dry/non-condensing" environment? 
A11:  The details of the way that you propose to provide the measured values of temperature should be covered in the proposal.  The Government will consider the effectiveness of your approach when the proposals are evaluated.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q12: We asked if Cyclical Redundancy Check (CRC) was suitable to provide data link integrity, and the government replied CRC was generally not sufficient to protect the integrity of a data link. We recognize that with one-way data transfers that there is no way to do "error detection and correction" but only "error detection". Error correction requires two-way protocols (as in V.32/V32bis/V42) and drives us to putting a receiver on the dropsondes. We would like to rephrase the question as: "if we send data between the sonde and the airborne receiver as one-way, CRC tagged data, such that single or multi bit errors are detected and the data ignored (resulting in a single packet data loss), so that only good packets made it through, and enough good packets made it so we meet the target data telemetry threshold", would that be considered responsive? In other words, if we have error detection but not error correction between the sonde and receiver but have both error detection and correction between the receiver and the ground station (that is, the Iridium satcom data link between the airborne receiver and the ground station detection and correction), is that OK? 
A12:  All technical aspects of the communications link ?between the sonde and the airborne receiver? are the prerogative of the proposer.  The Government interest is in the data packets received at the ground station.  If those data packets meet the applicable specifications given in the RFP, the proposed design will be considered acceptable.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q13:   The government has stated it expects that "all sensor performance targets need to be met." If we are unable to meet one or more target sensor specs during testing, what will be the financial ramifications? For example, if we cannot meet, say, the 0.3mbar pressure spec over the entire a +/-100F temp span, can the government withhold payment on the contract, and if so, what amount? Will there be progress payments? 
A13:  The Government expects all performance targets to be met.  Offerors should not propose if they cannot meet all the requirements.  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q14: Would a NCAR/UCAR subcontract be allowed under the contract (as they are a FRDC organization)? The team there has a wealth of operational experience, especially with balloon-borne deployments. But NCAR is often not allowed to participate in certain types of procurement due to their non-profit status.
A14:  Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) are generally prohibited from participating in competitive acquisitions. Any offeror that teams with an FFRDC will be reviewed for its lawfulness.  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q15: Design rights: Would the government elaborate as to why the as built design must be turned over at the end of the contract, given the maximum dollar amount is only $200,000? What is the long term advantage to the contractor in being able to supply these commercially?  
A15:  The Government requires the as-built design at the end of the contract in order to have a complete and current design at contract completion. The Government also requires this design if it should desire to make modifications in the future or for some reason, the design owner is unable to compete on future requirements.
The advantage to an offeror, if any, is one for each offeror to determine on its own.  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q16: (re: progress payments), the government has stated that 25% would be paid upon design review, 50% upon user training, and the final 25% upon final test acceptance. As most of the work is in getting the sonde design to actually pass the rather stringent sensor specifications, the user training and testing will be lumped together near the end of the whole effort. Essentially, training cannot take place prior to the ability to deliver a working test item. This means that roughly 75% of the funds would be withheld until the point where the testing occurs, and only then assuming tests occur successfully. Assuming a one year effort, this means the government will withhold 75% of funds for 9 or 10 months. Certainly, this payment schedule is an advantage for the government as it delays expenditures until the end. But businesses must pay vendors within 30 days and typically make payroll every two weeks. Why can't several additional technical milestones be established such that progress payments are metered out on a monthly basis, rather than bunched up at the end? Related to the question below, this progress payment schedule appears to place a significant financial burden on the smaller contractors, favoring larger business entities that typically have highly diversified and more established business lines, over smaller businesses.

A16:  Payments will be made in accordance with Section G.4 entitled, INTERIM PAYMENTS, in the solicitation.  A shorter payment schedule may be available if a small business wins the award.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q17:   (re: small business set-aside), the government has stated based on lack of response from a past RFI last winter, there appeared to be not more than one small business that could potentially fill the need.  We note that particular RFI was for a much more technically aggressive non-GPS (radio direction finding), 20g dropsonde with a $20 target cost, which, in our opinion was vastly different than the current RFP goals. Hence, the current RFP isn't a small business set-aside, yet we have identified three established small business manufacturers in the US that have the capability to perform this work: Yankee Environmental Systems, Intermet and Space Data. Moreover, both Yankee and Intermet have had recent major contracts with NOAA. We ask why this RFP is not made a small business set-aside, based on the fact that there is more than one potential vendor? We recognize that the agency wants as many bidders as possible. However, given the clear Congressional mandates that have been established for many years to help small/disadvantaged businesses, we respectfully submit that this RFP ought to be a small business set-aside, rather than an open procurement.

A17:  As required by the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the Government conducted market research to determine the procurement strategy (set-aside or full-and-open competition.)  A Request for Information was posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website.  The Government reviewed the qualification statements received and determined that not more than one small business had the capability to perform.  Accordingly, the decision was made to use a full-and-open competition strategy.   As requested in the RFI, vendors used their qualification statements to provide information to the Government about market dropsonde size availability. The Government?s need for as small a dropsonde as possible to meet its requirement has not changed.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q18: Frangibility requirement: over the years, the FAA has developed a set of standards for frangibility to keep air travel as safe as possible. Even if we could ignore device cost and meet the stated accuracy via (for instance) a chilled mirror hygrometer for dew point, a three thermistor sensor for temperature and a temperature-compensated aneroid barometer for pressure, the end device will be quite physically large and bulky. Yet if we must meet frangibility and accuracy, the device will necessarily become large, (mitigating the 'ultralight' in UDS.) Given that the dropsondes are most commonly deployed over open ocean areas having minimal air traffic (due to the hurricane), will the government waive all frangibility requirements, or will we be required to meet those established guidelines?

A18:  There is no frangibility requirement in the RFP.  The test flights using helium balloons will be conducted under a FAA waiver where the frangibility of the unit under test will not be an issue. 
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Q19: Target cost vs. sensor specs: Tied into the above set of sensor questions, does NOAA intend this to be a "performance at any cost" design or is low unit cost a major requirement? Thus far into the questioning period, it appears that cost is not an object, while sensor accuracy certainly is the goal. The current RD-93 made by Vaisala does not meet the accuracy specs but cost $700 each in quantity, and it appears that we may be headed towards a $5000 dropsonde. Would NOAA please comment on the expected tradeoff between end unit acquisition cost and expected/desired sensor performance? We are keenly aware of market pressures and want to be sure the design is as affordable as possible.

A19:  The requirements for this acquisition are given in the RFP.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q20:  With regard to telemetry range, is there a specification for range between the actual dropsondes and the unmanned aerial vehicle? It?s my understanding from reading the solicitation that the 300 km specification is for effective range between the unmanned aerial vehicle and the ground/receiving station.
 

A20:  There is no specification for range between the actual dropsonde and the aerial vehicle from which it was deployed.  It is understood that the dropsonde would take data from release height down to the surface.  The understanding that the 300 km specification is for effective range between the aerial vehicle and the ground station is correct.

<DESC>The University of California, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is seeking sources for the design and fabrication of a tritium processing system.

The Tritium Processing System (TPS) will be an integral portion of a radiation management infrastructure required to support the National Ignition Campaign.  The TPS will be configured to recover tritium from building operations at a rate of approximately 500scfm.

Principal components of the TPS include: process plumbing, process controls and alarms, abort tank system and support frame, ventilated enclosure, and project documentation.

The TPS will use a well established tritium recovery process, involving tritium oxidation, with the resultant water collected on molecular sieve beds.  The molecular sieve beds will be removable for off site disposal or reprocessing of the molecular sieve media.  A built in regeneration loop for the molecular sieve is not part of this scope.

The process plumbing skids will be configured such that they can be brought to the installation site via a freight elevator.  The process plumbing skids will be housed within a ventilated indoor enclosure with appropriate feed-throughs for plumbing, electrical and fire protection systems.  The design will consider OSHA noise standards.

To optimize the use of space at LLNL, the abort tanks will be located above the TPS enclosure on a structural steel support frame.

Experience designing and fabricating systems in accordance with the criteria of 10 CFR 830.122 Quality Assurance Criteria is essential.

Interested contractors should submit detailed information on their qualifications and capabilities via email to Nathan Ancheta, at ancheta3@llnl.gov.

<ARCHDATE>11302006
<CONTACT>Vicki Diaz, 937-255-0748
<DESC>The 716 AESG, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH contemplates the award of sole source contract actions to extend production kit  modification options for the C-5 Avionics Modernization Program (AMP).  Lockheed-Martin Corporation was awarded the C-5 AMP Engineering,  Manufacturing, and Development contract under full and open, best value  source selection in 1999.  The contract included competitively priced  production options for AMP kits, spares, and installation for up to 124  aircraft.  Budget adjustments and program delays have forced the need to  restructure the options for production for up to 53 operational C-5 A/B/C  aircraft.  The first of these kits/spares are anticipated to be awarded in  December 07 and the option for the associated installation is anticipated  to be exercised in December 08.  Lockheed-Martin Corp is the only source  possessing the technical and engineering expertise to continue the  production of C-5 AMP, maintaining total schedule, configuration, and  system performance responsibility of the re-phased acquisition.  Sole  source negotiation for restructure of options for kits and spares for C-5  AMP production is envisioned pursuant to the authority of 10 USC  2304(c)(1), as implemented under FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).  The USAF cannot  provide sufficient drawings, data, etc to facilitate award of kits and  spares to another source.  Sole source negotiation for restructure of  options for installation for C-5 AMP production is envisioned pursuant to  the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR  6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).  TCTO 714 and Level 3 wire harness installation  drawings are available.  The 716 AESG, however, believes that award of  installation to another source would result in substantial duplication of  cost that the Government would not recover through competition and would  result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling USAF requirements.  Lockheed-Martin, at the start of the up to 53 installations covered by  this action, will have completed 59 to 60 installations at Dover and  Travis Air Force Bases.  The 716 AESG does not plan to issue a formal  Request for Proposal.  Interested sources, however, are invited to submit  capability statements for consideration.  Such statements shall be  submitted with 10 days of this publication to 716 AESG/PK, Building 558,  2590 Loop Road West, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7142 to the attention  of Ms. Vicki Diaz, Contracting Officer or Victoria.diaz@wpafb.af.mil.  Questions may be addressed to Ms. Diaz at (937) 255-0748. Current status is pre-solicitation.  This is Category 16  aircraft  components and accessories program.

<DESC>PURPOSE

The Federal Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to solicit information from qualified vendors on implementing recently passed legislation. The legislation grants OCSE the authority to match individuals owing past-due child support with individuals receiving insurance claims, settlements, awards, and payments from insurance agencies or insurers.

OCSE is seeking an efficient and cost effective solution to implement the insurance match legislation.  The solution should provide flexibility for states and insurers or their agents in submitting and receiving information regarding insurance data.  The solution must support web services and electronic transmission of child support case and insurance data. 

OCSE is interested in exploring the use of vendors (private industry, state Child Support Enforcement agencies, and other federal agencies) to work with OCSE in the design, development and implementation of the insurance match legislation.  

It is possible that OCSE will use the information acquired from the responses to this RFI to develop a Request for Proposal (RFP).  There is no guarantee that an RFP will follow this RFI.  
 
PROBLEM STATEMENT 

Currently, states lack a national insurance match program that would allow them to identify insurance payments, claims and/or settlements payable to individuals owing past-due child support.  Recently passed legislation grants OCSE the authority to compare information about delinquent obligors who owe past-due child support with insurance data in order to provide information to state child support enforcement (CSE) agencies responsible for collecting past-due child support.  The insurance match legislation is optional for both states and insurers.  Therefore, alternatives selected for implementation should require minimal effort from insurers and states and use automation to the maximum extent possible.  

At this time, less than half of the state CSE agencies are actively engaged in matching with insurers.  States currently participating in insurance matching are not reaping all the possible benefits of identifying insurance claims because several of the nation=s largest insurers are not participating in the existing insurance matching programs.

SCOPE OF RFI

OCSE intends to use the results of the RFI as a basis for determining alternatives for implementing the national insurance match.  OCSE acknowledges that implementation will occur at different times for states and insurers, therefore, the alternatives should address a rolling implementation.  

The RFI should include information about how vendors would:

1.	Identify data elements available for exchange.
2.	Accomplish the data exchange between OCSE and insurers or their agents.
3.	Address data security and confidentiality.
4.	Provide outreach to insurers and/or their agents.


SECTION 2: RFI CALENDAR OF EVENTS 

This RFI is being issued based on the calendar below, which OCSE may revise, as necessary.  Time is in business days.  If there is a change in the timeline, any vendor that has expressed an interest in the RFI should check FedBizzOpps for any amendments that may be posted regarding the timeline or any other parts of the RFI.

SECTION 3: OVERVIEW OF THE CURRENT PROCESS

Several states have legal requirements for insurers doing business in their state to compare the claimant=s identifying information to child support lien information maintained by the child support enforcement (CSE) agency to determine whether there is a child support lien prior to issuing a claim, settlement or award.  In 1998, under Federal grant, the State of Rhode Island implemented a pilot insurance match program.  The program was successful in pilot and Rhode Island obtained an additional Federal grant to expand use of the insurance match and intercept program to all states.  Insurers doing business in the states with the child support reporting requirements supported the effort to streamline the insurance match process between insurers and states.  Currently, the Child Support Lien Network (CSLN) has 23 member states that submit their delinquent obligors.  CSLN matches the delinquent obligor file with the Insurance Service Office (ISO) database, which contains insurance claims information from approximately 96 percent of insurers nationwide.  For a majority of states participating in CSLN, the verified claims are returned to the state CSE agencies and the states take the appropriate action to intercept the insurance settlement.  For some states, CSLN issues the notice of freeze/seize to the insurer on behalf of the state CSE agency.

CSLN provides secure File Transfer Protocol (FTP) sites or secure web site upload/download features for interfacing with state CSE agencies and secure FTP to exchange match information with ISO.

SECTION 4: OVERVIEW OF DESIRED FEATURES

The partnership between private and public sectors to provide children with the support they deserve continues to grow.  Currently, OCSE partners with employers and financial institutions to provide states with information that enables them to collect current and past-due child support.  State child support systems are increasingly using web services and electronic means to perform child support enforcement services.  

The most attractive solutions would include features that allow flexibility for state CSE agencies and insurers and also include options for web services and other secure, electronic data exchange mechanisms. 

OCSE is seeking vendor solutions that will provide access to insurance claims information by OCSE for matching purposes using an automated data exchange that is cost-effective, efficient, and secure.   

Cost-effectiveness.  Solutions that are economical in terms of the goods or services received for the money spent for insurers, state child support enforcement agencies and OCSE.  Solutions that provide discounted pricing due to the social service nature of U.S. child support agencies= business are encouraged.  

Efficiency.  Solutions that allow batch and/or on-line processing of child support case data and insurance claims information using automation.  Solutions that leverage existing insurance matching products and institutional agreements are also encouraged. 

Security and confidentiality.  Solutions must preserve the security and confidentiality of personal data exchanged for the national insurance match.

1.	Cost to conduct the match with insurers or their agent(s) and return all matched data to one location instead of to each state/territory (54 locations).
2.	Cost for match verification (if vendor has the ability to verify matches) to determine if the claim is open/active and to ensure, to the maximum extent possible, that the individual who filed the claim is the delinquent obligor submitted by the state CSE agency.
3.	Cost for outreach to insurers and/or their agent(s) and state CSE agencies.
4.	Cost for monthly maintenance fees, if applicable.

<DESC>The service provider shall provide the necessary products and services to accomplish all of the requirements stated herein.
The Office of Foreign Missions (OFM) in the Department of State seeks to institute a credit and/or debit card based system to manage its obligation for providing diplomatic tax-relief privileges for foreign diplomatic missions, international organizations and their members throughout the United States.  This new system will be referred to as the Diplomatic Tax-Exempt Credit/Debit (TECD) Program.    

OFM seeks from the private sector proposals for the provision of diplomatic tax-relief privileges initiated through the use of a provider issued ?tax-exempt? credit and/or debit card to foreign missions, international organizations and their eligible personnel.  ?Tax-Exempt? means vendors should exempt or remove charges associated with most taxes on purchases made using such cards.  The U.S. government will not underwrite or assume any liability for these credit/debit cards, and also will not guarantee payment of the debts on these credit cards. All risk in extending credit will fall on the credit issuer.  

OFM hopes to eventually provide diplomatic tax-relief privileges solely through a credit/debit card-based system.  However, it accepts that technological and programmatic issues stand as current obstacles to achieving this vision.   Therefore, this credit/debit card will serve as one of two systems that OFM will make available to the foreign mission and international organization community for obtaining diplomatic tax.  OFM estimates that such credit/debit cards will be used frequently and will likely have a higher average use-rate in comparison to those issued to average consumers.  

The tax-exemption identification cards that OFM currently produces will continue to exist as an option for the provision of diplomatic tax-relief privileges.  However, the option to use the existing system will only be available to certain individuals.  Therefore, the majority of the diplomatic and international community will receive their tax-relief benefits through the TECD Program.  Each mission/organization will have the option of using either the existing tax-exemption identification card system or the new TECD Program.  In the event the selected bank is unable to provide services to a mission/organization or their members, they will be able to use the existing system.   

There are roughly 9,000 diplomatic tax-exemption cards currently circulating throughout the United States.  

The provision of this service will attract the operating accounts of many foreign missions and international organizations as well as their members to the bank selected for this program.  Therefore, service providers stand to generate new revenues not only from providing this system, but also through the added customer and deposit base that goes along with providing banking services to such account holders.  

As a point of reference concerning the credit worthiness of foreign missions and their members, in conjunction with participating oil companies, OFM has provided ?tax-exempt? gasoline credit cards to foreign missions and diplomats since the mid-1980s.  Although, the tax-relief mechanism used with this card is vastly different from the one described in this document, the extension and management of credit to foreign missions and their members is basically identical.   Over the past 20 years, the service providers of the ?tax-exempt? gasoline credit cards have reported extremely few problems concerning foreign missions or their members as routinely delinquent or unable to pay balances on such accounts.  A list of the oil companies that participate in the ?tax-exempt gasoline credit card program can be viewed on the OFM website at www.state.gov/ofm/tax/gasoline/24625.htm.  

OFM will permit the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) to participate in the TECD program to facilitate its responsibility to provide tax-relief privileges to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States (TECRO) and its members.  These privileges are established under the Taiwan Relations Act (PL 96-8) of April 10, 1979.   AIT will serve most of the roles/responsibilities identified for OFM in this document.  

This solicitation not only offers the opportunity for service providers to present a solution to OFM?s business process needs for a credit and/or debit card based diplomatic tax relief program, but to propose added services that might realize the Department of State?s vision of electronic and streamlined government business processes, both domestically and abroad.

Currently, OFM plans to offer this opportunity to all service providers capable of meeting or exceeding the requirements established in this document.   

Background of the Diplomatic Tax Exemption Process:
The Foreign Missions Act of 1982 (22 USC 4301-4316) requires that OFM manage the U.S. Government?s provision of certain diplomatic privileges on the basis of reciprocity.  The U.S. Government?s obligation to provide diplomatic tax relief is primarily a result of both the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.  However, this privilege is also an obligation of various other bilateral and multilateral treaties and agreements, such as the United Nations Headquarters? Agreement. 

The authority to authorize TECRO and its members for tax-relief privileges is an obligation of AIT in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act (PL 96-8) of April 10, 1979.      

Due to the reciprocity requirement in the Foreign Missions Act, OFM is required to provide foreign missions with diplomatic tax relief privileges to the extent that each counterpart foreign government provides such relief to the U.S. diplomatic mission and its members.  Therefore, OFM limits or denies tax exemption to missions that limit or deny tax relief to U. S. diplomatic representatives in the host countr

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
RESIDENTIAL SOLAR THERMAL POWER PLANT

.

Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to commercialize LLNL?s recently invented Residential Solar Thermal Power Plant.

Background: Solar power is a renewable source of energy that involves no fossil fuel combustion, and releases no greenhouse gases. In the past, solar power has not been economically competitive in the primary electric power market in the United States. Recent developments at LLNL in concentrating solar thermal power when commercialized are estimated to be able to supply electric power for 6?/kWh at the single family residential scale, and thus be lower than the current retail price for residential electric power of approximately 10?/kWh.
 
Description: The LLNL technology converts sunlight to electric power much more economically than has hitherto been achievable with comparable concentrating solar thermal power systems. Approximately 25% of the incident sunlight on the present system is converted to electric power, with most of the remaining solar energy captured for water heating or space heating. In the winter, approximately 90% of the incident sunlight is exploited.

Advantages: This invention makes solar power an economically competitive distributed source of heating and power. This energy is produced without emission of greenhouse gases, and without production of other air pollutants associated with fossil fuel combustion. The consumer is also insulated from fluctuations in the cost of fossil fuels.

Potential Applications: There are two scales on which this technology can be applied. The first, the single family residential scale, is particularly attractive in states such as California that have Net Electric Power metering, and Time of Use rate schedules. Using this invention, the homeowner can either be completely self-sufficient, by generating sufficient solar power to offset his own consumption, or can substantially decrease his electric and gas bills by generating a portion of his needs. In addition, the consumer may benefit from rebates offered by the California Energy Commission. At the second, large scale of centralized electric power generation stations, this invention further allows for the generation of electric power that is economically competitive at wholesale rates.


Development Status: While patents are pending on this LLNL technology, testing of small-scale prototype components is ongoing, and several of the critical high efficiency factors have been proven. Economic analysis of the cost of solar thermal electric power according to the current invention indicates that in modest production, a competitive return on investment is available to the consumer.
 

LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.

<SUBJECT>J -- J - Copier Maintenance RFI
<DESC>DESCRIPTION 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is hereby conducting market research, pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 10.001 by issuing this Request for Information.  The FDA is seeking information from vendors who can provide copier maintenance for the FDA?s current (see attached spreadsheets) and potential inventory of copiers.  Copier maintenance is anticipated to include (1) parts and labor for copiers and accessories and (2) consumable supplies (other than paper).

A. PURPOSE

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal (RFP) or Request for Quotations (RFQ)) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future.  This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Interested parties are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party?s expense.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked PROPRIETARY will be handled accordingly.

Interested parties are advised that the Government is not obligated to provide comments on any particular submission.  The Government, however, may ask for additional information or clarifications as needed.  The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by the Interested Parties in responding to follow-up queries.

The Government is also requesting information from small businesses, which includes Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Women-Owned Small Businesses, HUBZone Small Businesses, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses. All small businesses are strongly encouraged to provide responses to this RFI. This will assist FDA in determining the potential levels of interest, competition, and technical capability to provide the required services within the Small Business community.  In addition, this information may also be used to assist FDA in establishing a baseline for developing any subsequent potential subcontracting plan small business goal percentages, as necessary.

Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract or agreement.  The Government will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this RFI.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if one is issued. 

B. GENERAL 

The FDA?s Copier Maintenance Commodity Council is chartered to critically analyze FDA?s overall copier maintenance requirements and recommend methods to strategically acquire the necessary services to achieve cost savings, to improve performance in support, and to increase quality of services. 

The FDA is located in numerous buildings in the Washington, DC, Metropolitan Area with other offices and laboratories located throughout the United States of America.  The attached spreadsheet details these locations, the FDA?s current inventory of copiers with makes and models, and the level of service agreements.  The spreadsheet does not, however, include any additional copiers purchased in the 4th quarter of Fiscal Year 2006). 

The FDA is considering awarding a five-year, fixed-price, blanket purchase agreement(s) (BPA) via the General Services Administration?s Federal Supply Service Program for its copier maintenance requirements.  However, this approach will be reviewed in consideration of the responses received from this RFI.

Industry comments are requested for consideration to determine the most suitable approach to acquiring the services and items to meet the Government?s requirements.

C. DESIRED INFORMATION 

Vendors with expertise in providing copier maintenance are invited to submit information regarding the FDA?s requirement for copier maintenance and address the following, as well as providing any other helpful information:

1.  Vendors should submit capability statements / written documentation which demonstrate the vendor?s ability to fulfill the requirements.  Responses should include the vendor?s business size status based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 811212.  The vendor should summarize their skills and experience in supporting similar requirements.  This summary should also include any ?teaming? or ?subcontracting? arrangements in which the vendor participated in providing services for a requirement of this magnitude.  The vendor should provide a customer point of contact (name, address, telephone number) for each experience described and indicate whether the vendor performed as a prime or subcontractor.  

2.  Vendors should identify any contract vehicles (GSA/FSS, GWACs, etc) that are currently available that can support the requirements contained herein.  

3.  Vendors should address the feasibility of the Government?s plan to use a BPA as the acquisition tool for its requirements and the degree of interest such a vehicle might generate along with comments regarding other potential approaches.  

4.  The Vendor should address what percentage of the work can be done with the vendor?s own employees and what percentage of the work would be subcontracted?  Or, if the vendor is large business, discuss the subcontracting opportunities that will be made available for small business, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or woman-owned small businesses?  If no subcontracting opportunities would be made available, please provide the rationale for that decision.

5.  The Vendor should address any difficulties or constraints foreseen in providing services to the identified geographically diverse areas or providing services for multiple equipment manufacturers that should be considered by the Government when drafting the requirements. 

6.  Are there any unique issues applicable to the purchase of these services that the Government should consider when drafting the requirements?

7.  Are there innovations in this area that the Government could benefit from and, if so, what are they?

8.  At what age is it generally determined that it is no longer cost effective to keep a copier under a maintenance agreement?  Is there a white paper or other documentation on customary industry practice?

9.  Please provide information on contracts, business size (any small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small business, etc), scope, plans, performance based statements of work, constraints, etc.  If there is any other information that can be provided to assist the Government with drafting the requirements (such as performance based statements of work, repair and escalation of problem time parameters, levels of service available, problem reporting procedures, etc) please provide it as part of your response.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the sam relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held- 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

The contractor shall provide all labor, tools, parts, materials, equipment, facilities, transportation and supervision necessary to provide 30th Contracting Squadron (CONS) move from Bldg 7015 (2nd Floor) to Bldg 8500 and Small Business Office (SBO) move from Bldg 11777 (1st Floor) to Bldg 8500.
1.  Scope of Work:  30 CONS and SBO are currently located in two (2) separate buildings.  However, both of these units will be relocated to 2 different areas in Bldg 8500 under one (1) single move contract.  The 30 CONS's move will be broken down into 2 phases.  The first phase will include the relocation of the 30 CONS Government furnished items.  The second phase will be the relocation of the 30 CONS servers, UPS, and associated electronic equipment. The time between the first phase and second phase shall not be longer than 6 months.  30 CONS will relocate to a furnished area in Bldg 8500 and therefore will leave most the stand alone and systems furniture behind.  However, the Small Business Office will be moving to an unfurnished office and will require the existing stand alone furniture to be moved from Bldg 11777 to their new office in Bldg 8500.  Moving work includes, but is not limited to providing moving boxes, labor and expertise to relocate all Government items of the 30 CONS from Building 7015 (2nd Floor) to Building 8500.

The Contractor shall provide a receipt for the total number of boxes that will be delivered to each unit.  The Contractor might be required to pack Government items that are not already in boxes on the day of the move.  Government items may include, but are not limited to copiers, computers, monitors, printers, scanners, plotters, typewriters, UPS, shredder, chairs, filing cabinets, storage lockers, display cases, book cases, tables, archives, maps, documents and other miscellaneous property (to include all refrigerators, microwaves, and wall hangings) from Building 7015 and Bldg 11777 to Bldg 8500.  The 30th Contracting Squadron is moving into a furnished area, so the relocation of furniture shall be minimal.  However, the Small Business Office is moving into an unfurnished area.  Therefore, all existing furniture shall be relocated from Bldg 11777 to Bldg 8500.
1.1.2  Prior to the arrival of the movers, the 30th Contracting Squadron and Small Business Office personnel will ensure that all computer associated equipment (i.e., computers, mice, card readers, speakers, monitors, printers, scanners, plotters, etc.) to be moved are appropriately dismantled and disconnected from outlets, and the workstations are clear and ready to move.  The 30thContracting Squadron and Small Business Office personnel should label all boxes and bulky electric items so that they can be delivered to the appropriate places in Bldg 8500.  The contractor shall provide special boxes and moving equipment for the relocation of computers, monitors and keyboards to reduce damages during the packaging and transportation process.

INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS

A. Systems Submission of Invoices. 

 Invoice submission is a two step process:

The Vendor shall develop an Acceptance Information document in IT Solutions Shop (ITSS) and attach a copy of invoice with all required back-up documentation.

     Current ITSS web site https://it-solutions.gsa.gov

The Vendor shall also complete the invoice form on the Finance web site and attach soft copy of invoice.  This is the official system of record; the invoice will not be processed for payment unless this process is completed.  

     Current General Services Administration (GSA) Finance web site is www.finance.gsa.gov.  Go to
    http://finance.gsa.gov/password/ to obtain Password/Sign-Up for Email Notification.

B. Invoice Submission Process.

?	Submit each invoice only once.  Submitting multiple copies confuses and delays processing.

?	If editing is required, update the first submission; don?t create a second invoice submission.

?	Make sure the invoice amount and the acceptance document amount are the same.

?	Use the invoice number for both the Finance and ITSS submission.  Don?t use voucher numbers.  Always enter the invoice number on the Acceptance document in ITSS.  The invoice number must be identical in both sites.

?	Do not use special characters in the invoice number, only alpha and/or numeric.  No spaces in invoice number.

?	If an invoice is rejected, a corrected invoice will be submitted using the original invoice number with some type of unique identifier attached; i.e. ?R? to denote resubmission which will make the invoice number unique.  Each invoice submission must have an invoice number that is unique.

?	In addition, the contractor is responsible for ensuring client acceptance of invoice. This can be accomplished in ITSS or contractor may have client sign a hard copy of invoice prior to attaching to the Acceptance Information document in ITSS.

?	Invoice must be submitted in ITSS on Acceptance Information document and include copy of invoice and required back-up attached.

C. Timing of invoices.

Invoices shall be submitted for payment of deliverables that have been completed and accepted by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR).

For Firm Fixed Price (FFP), this will be a completed and accepted deliverable.  Evidence that the COR accepted the deliverable must be present before the GSA Project Manager (PM) can proceed.  Ensure the invoice is submitted in accordance with the established payment schedule.  

For Time and Material (T&M), this will be a month?s worth of services.  The COR will certify that the contractor has performed in accordance with the statement of work and the government has received the hours and/or materials billed by the contractor.  Ensure the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.232-7, Payments under Time-and-Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts, are fully complied with.  GSA PM will certify the invoice for payment.

D. Payment of Invoices.

Payment of invoices shall be based on the quality of the invoiced deliverable.  If the invoiced deliverable does not meet the established contractual standards, the invoice will not be paid until the deliverable has been determined to meet the established standards, as applicable.

	The contractor is reminded that invoices will be submitted In accordance with (IAW) FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions ? Commercial Items, paragraph g, which states the following:  
52.212-4(g) Invoice.

STATEMENT OF WORK 
Project Number GHLN 06-1097

Install carpet in building 1292 and the corridor connecting building 1294

1. GENERAL:
a.   Carpet is not government furnished. Contractor shall supply carpet and deliver it to building 1292 for installation. See attached drawings for locations of new carpet.

b.   All other materials (adhesives, edge strips, floor stone, seam joining materials, etc.) are to be furnished by the Contractor and of a type suitable for the purpose intended.

c.   There is existing carpet to be removed. Contractor is responsible for off-base disposal.

d.   Hazardous Materials (HM) Approval. Contractor shall submit a Materials Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for each chemical and/or compound proposed carpet or vinyl installation to the Base Bioenvironmental Office (90 ADOS/SGGB) for review and approval prior to delivery to the base. A HM is defined in Federal Standard DED-STD-313D, Tables I and II. The definition of materials presenting a health or physical hazard is found in OSHA 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.1200(c).

e.   Hazardous Materials Management. All HM shall be managed, stored and monitored in full compliance with all applicable local, state, federal and Air Force regulations. Contractors who bring hazardous materials onto FEW AFB without authorization are responsible for any punitive or regulatory actions. Contractors are responsible for proper disposal of containers/hazardous material. Flammable liquids shall be stored in an approved fireproof storage cabinet. All chemicals shall be secured and properly stored when not in use.

f.   Prohibited Hazardous Materials. Prohibited materials include those that contain Class 1 ozone-depleting substances (including CFCs, halons, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform and methyl bromide) per Air Force Policy and as regulated by Title VI of the Clean Air Act, specifically Sections 601-607. Other prohibited construction materials include lead (i.e. lead-based paint), asbestos, PCBs or other hazardous substances.

g.   New and Recycled Materials and Equipment Purchasing. All materials shall be new or newly manufactured using recycled materials unless otherwise indicated. All materials (both new and recycled) shall be the most suitable and highest grade and type for the intended use unless otherwise indicated. They shall be produced by a manufacturer regularly engaged in manufacturing or fabricating similar products with a history of successful production acceptable to the Contracting Office. When names of manufacturers or models are
 
listed, the purpose is to give examples of products meeting the specifications and to provide a basis for comparison subject to the following: (1) The product is equivalent to the specified product meets or exceeds the requirements of the specifications and is otherwise suitable for the intended use. (2) The warranty meets or exceeds that of the specified product and the requirements of the specifications. (3) The Contractor coordinates the installation and makes any necessary changes at no additional cost to the Government. (4) The Contractor waives claims for any time extension associated with the use of the product.

h. Recycled Product Purchases. Contractors must comply with guidelines and requirements of The Air Force Affirmative Procurement Program for the purchase and use of recycled material. This is required by Presidential Executive Order and Section 6002 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (42 U.S.C. 6962). The use of recycled products is mandatory unless they are not available within a reasonable time frame, or if the cost exceeds the cost of a non-recycled item or if they do not meet the technical requirements of the project, or if they are not available from at least two (2) sources so as to maintain a satisfactory level of competition. The construction materials included under this requirement are all types of carpet made of polyester fiber and floor tile containing recovered rubber or plastic. The use of other recycled products is encouraged.


i. Recycled Products Reporting. Contractors must compile a "Recycled Products Report" for the Resource Recovery and Recycling Manager at 90 CES/CEV listing the total quantity recycled products used. Submit the report through the COAR at the end of the contract period or at the end of the calendar year, whichever comes first.

j. Material Storage. Contractors shall protect materials during delivery, storage, handling and installation per manufacturer's printed instructions. Materials should be delivered in original containers or packaging with labels intact. Storage locations shall not interfere with work of other trades. Acceptable temperature and humidity conditions must be maintained. Work areas shall be enclosed, watertight, and heated as necessary to protect finish materials during and after installation.

k. Affirmative Procurement Guidance. The use of recycled material shall follow requirements based upon Department of the Air Force Space Command Affirmative Procurement Program Policy and Guidance Letter dated 8 April 2002. The main legal requirements for an Affirmative Procurement Program (APP) are derived from Executive Order 13101 dated 14 September 1998 (http;//www.ofee.gov) and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Section 6002 (http://www.ornl.gov/ornlp2/sec6002.htm). This policy requires action by the Federal Government or its authorized agents to make more efficient use of natural resources by maximizing recycling and preventing waste whenever possible. Specifically, it mandates procurement of the five EPA guideline items; calls for review of government plans and specifications to eliminate virgin material requirements; requires recycling programs and requires consideration of: recovered materials use, reuse of products, life cycle cost analysis, ease of recycling, and use of environmentally preferable products.

<DESC>AMENDMENT AS FOLLOWS:
Question1:  Do you want the Generator towable unit to have a pintle hitch with a receiver on the rear to tow the Portable A/C & Heater unit behind? This will allow only one vehicle needed to tow the units. Yes we would want a pintle hitch on the rear of the A/C unit. 
 
Question 2:  There is no mention on hitch configuration; we assume you want a Pintle Hook setup? We would prefer to have a pintle hook setup; this is the most universal setup with our other support equipment and tow vehicles.
 
Question 3:  Fuel type for the generator? We would prefer to have diesel fuel, again this the universal fuel type so it would be readily available.
 
Question 4:  Flexible Duct size [diameter] and length of duct. We need 8 inch diameter and approximately 160 feet long.  We would like to keep the number of sections to a minimum to provide a 100 foot length and two similar length stubs (approximately 30 foot each) off the main 100 foot trunk.  A continuous length is not required.  Any cost effective solution is acceptable.
 
Question 5:  Plug configuration for the Portable AC/Heater. Keep in mind we can configure the plugs the same as the GLC system; we just need to know what you would like. A Generator plug to the A/C & Heater / A Generator plug to the GLC System. So, what plug configuration is on the GLC? We'll need to adapt to the GLC. The air conditioner/heater unit must have plug compatible with the Cooper ARKTITE Series 3R, AR-1042, Model M3, 3 pole, 4 wire, 600 volt, 100 ampere jack currently installed in the hangar.  The generator should have two load cords with a cord-mount mate to the air conditioner connector that is functionally equivalent of the ARKTITE AR-1042. 
 
Question 6:  Regarding the plug above; we need to know the length of cord you will need for each unit. 
We need a minimum of 85 feet for the air conditioner unit.  The generator should have a minimum of 10 feet of cordage, depending on the connection point, to allow the mated connectors to rest on the ground without inducing strain on the generator or posing a trip hazard.
 
Question 7:  Do you currently have a unit described in this solicitation on site that you would like to replicate? Unfortunately, no.

d.   Hazardous Materials (HM) Approval. Contractor shall submit a Materials Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for each chemical and/or compound proposed carpet or vinyl installation to the Base Bioenvironmental Office (90 ADOS/SGGB) for review and approval prior to delivery to the base. A HM is defined in Federal Standard DED-STD-313D, Tables I and II. The definition of materials presenting a health or physical hazard is found in OSHA 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.1200(c).

e.   Hazardous Materials Management. All HM shall be managed, stored and monitored in full compliance with all applicable local, state, federal and Air Force regulations.

Other prohibited construction materials include lead (i.e. lead-based paint), asbestos, PCBs or other hazardous substances.

g.   New and Recycled Materials and Equipment Purchasing. All materials shall be new or newly manufactured using recycled materials unless otherwise indicated.

The main legal requirements for an Affirmative Procurement Program (APP) are derived from Executive Order 13101 dated 14 September 1998 (http;//www.ofee.gov) and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Section 6002 (http://www.ornl.gov/ornlp2/sec6002.htm).
