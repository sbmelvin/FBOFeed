The expertise derived from daily production of a ?24by7' weather and climate television show is unique. The Weather Channel has a tremendous library of weather, climate and environmental video footage to use in making NOAA specials.  In most cases, new video footage would not need to be shot. This offers a significant production cost savings to NOAA.  The Weather Channel on-camera meteorologists (OCMs) to be used in the NOAA specials are recognized nationally by millions of viewers each and every day.  The OCMs are trained meteorologists who work full time on the nations only 24 hour weather and climate video network.  In addition, the contract will cover a provision for The Weather Channel to distribute NOAA specials on its video and Web network.  The Weather Channel video network  reaches over 80 million house holds using cable and direct broadcast satellite delivery.  These NOAA specials will run several times on the video network to ensure maximum audience exposure.  Further The Weather channel will inform the public of the NOAA specials on their web site, which is the most used portal for weather and climate information, averaging more than 350 million page views per month.  The contract will be for a base and two option periods.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The National Weather Service/Office of Hydrologic Development located at Silver Spring, MD has the following requirement.  The period of performance is for a total of 3 years, 1 Base Year with 2 1-year Options.

Objectives

There are two primary objectives:  (1) Develop innovative, operational, real-time rainfall analysis techniques using WSR-88D data that will generate ensembles of rainfall products that provide most-likely rainfall estimates and associated uncertainty information. The techniques should use WSR-88D data as their primary input and should not be dependent on the availability or density of rain gauge or satellite rainfall data. These techniques could be extensions of existing NWS radar-only techniques such as the PPS or could be new ones based on dual-polarized radar data. The techniques must be robust enough so that single-polarized reflectivity data and/or dual-polarized radar data could be used as input since both forms of radar data will be available from the WSR-88D in the near future. In either case, the proposed techniques must be efficient and robust enough to be viable in the
real-time operational environment of the NWS and must be able to be implemented within NWS WSR-88D computer systems and infrastructure. The procedures and products are expected to be validated against rain gauge data or other comparable rainfall sources in a variety of rainfall regimes across the topographically diverse U.S. in all four seasons.  (2) Develop innovative techniques based on human factors considerations to display this quantitative information to users that are both intuitive and informative, yet not overwhelming.

Deliverables

First-year deliverables include a written report from the contractor proposing and evaluating one or more possible techniques for generating ensemble or probabilistic radar rainfall estimates. This report should include a review of existing NWS QPE techniques such as stated above to assure the contractor understands the scope of current capabilities. Semiannual progress reports are required.

If the proposed techniques are judged by the NWS to be operationally viable and scientifically valid after NWS review of the year-1 report, development of the techniques can proceed in the second year with availability of funding. Semiannual progress reports are required.

The final deliverable at the end of the third year with availability of funding will be an operational prototype algorithm, including software and documentation, that can be implemented within existing NWS systems. Semiannual progress reports are required.

The proposals will be evaluated based on the following factors:  Past Performance, Knowledge of real-time rainfall analysis techniques, Knowledge of display techniques, and cost.  All factors will be weighted equally.

The period of performance is anticipated to be within 6 months from date of award.  EPA  believes that the University of Nevada, Reno is the only source capable of providing the required services based on previous experience, their familiarity with the study area, and their access to a unique database.

<DESC>Subject to final approval, the Bureau of the Public Debt intends to acquire, on a sole source basis, health plan decision tools (support software) from Asparity Decision Solutions, Inc., P. O. Box 14233, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina  27709.  The health plan decision tools will be for use by customer agencies of the Franchise Business Activity-Central (FBAC) of Cincinnati, OH.  FBA-Central has a need for an automated, user-friendly, web-based Federal Health Plan preference-based decision support application.

The application tool must have the ability to match an employee's personal health care preferences against their eligible health plan set, and rank them in the order that best meets their personal needs. The system must allow employees and annuitants access to compare specific information about available health plans, including benefit features, quality indicators, customer satisfaction ratings, accreditation status, and cost information.  The system or tool should use an intelligent multiple decision-making process of personal preferences, not just a matrix-oriented comparative checklist.

The FBAC has a need for the decision tool to be easily linked to an existing central web site that provides employee benefits information.  The link must be easily accessible without users having to deploy additional software.  The system must be able to host a large number of employees (500,000+) and have the scalability to add or remove thousands of users and handle hundreds of updates on hundreds of health plans.  The customer agencies that could become potential users of this service are worldwide. Therefore, the decision tool must include all Federal Health Care Plans (FEHB) available to employees, and be in compliance with Federal Regulation 508.

It is anticipated that customer agencies will begin receiving services on the first calendar day of the new fiscal year. Therefore, the required system must be operational and able to accept customers no later than September 30, 2002.

Firms must submit a description of their proposal in sufficient technical detail to substantiate the ability of any alternative service to meet all of these requirements.  Submissions should be sent to Shelia Monroe, contract specialist, at the contracting office address listed above.  If no affirmative written response is received within 15 days after publication of this notice to the effect that a comparable service is available, and that it is more advantageous to the Government than obtaining the service through the proposed contractor, a sole-source award will be made.  No solicitation document is available.  Requests for a solicitation document will not be considered an affirmative response.

<DESC>INDEFINITE DELIVERY / INDEFINITE QUANTITY (IDIQ) SOLUTION ORDER CONCEPT (SOC) MULTIPLE AWARD CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT (MACC) AT NAVAL AIR STATION, JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA, NAVAL STATION, MAYPORT, FLORIDA, AND TRIDENT SUBMARINE BASE, KINGS BAY, GEORGIA AND OTHER ACTIVITIES IN THE ENGINEERING FIELD ACTIVITY SOUTHEAST AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY. 
This acquisition will be limited to 8(a) firms servicing the Northeast Florida and Southeast Georgia Districts, which have a NAICS Sector Code 23.  All other firms are deemed ineligible to submit.
This solicitation will result in the award of three contracts to three 8(a) contractors who provide the most advantageous, responsive and responsible proposal resulting in the best value to the government, price and other factors considered. It is the intention of this acquisition to procure renovation, alteration, repair, and minor construction by means of an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity Solution Order Concept (SOC) Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) at Naval Air Station, Jacksonville, FL, Naval Station, Mayport, FL, and Trident Submarine Base, Kings Bay, GA and other activities in the Engineering Field Activity Southeast area of responsibility. This acquisition is for a base year of twelve months for a maximum value of $10 million with task orders in the range of $100,000.00 to $1,000,000.  The contract contains two twelve-month options for a total maximum duration of thirty-six months or a value of $30 million whichever comes first.
The three best value contractors will be selected for the award of either one of the seed projects or the award of a contract with a minimum guarantee.  The first projects procured under these IQ contracts will be firm fixed price, 100% design, and as follows:
1) Install Catwalk at Runway 27, Naval Air Station, Jacksonville, FL - Estimated Cost of Construction between $188,000.00 and $230,000.00.
2) Construction of Training Tower Over a Swimming Pool, B-614, Naval Air Station, Jacksonville, FL - Estimated Cost of Construction between $120,000.00 and $150,000.00
Projects assigned to these IQ contracts may use the Solution Order Concept (SOC) approach to scope and price the work.  After award of the initial contract to the three contractors, they will compete for delivery orders based on either best value or low price technically acceptable to the Government through Government/Contractor Team Cooperative scoping of the work.   
OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Offerors should not assume that they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals. However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions to provide an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal. 
FOLLOW-ON WORK AFTER AWARD; All three contractors awarded an IDIQ Contract will compete on subsequent task orders. Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages. Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either the best value trade-off continuum or low price. If the Government decides to issue the task order as a best value, award factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order. Should one of the three IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, then the Government reserves the right to negotiate a task order with only that offeror.

The RFP will be available at esol.navfac.navy.mil on or after August 1, 2002.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) intends to solicit proposals for the Instrument Incubator Program (IIP), a technology development program in support of the Earth Science Enterprise (ESE). The IIP seeks proposals for technology development activities leading to new system and subsystem level airborne and space-based measurement techniques which: ·  reduce the risk, cost, size, and development time of Earth observing instruments, and ·  enable new Earth observation measurements. The IIP is designed to reduce the risk of new, innovative instrument systems so that they can be successfully used in future science solicitations in a fast track (3 year) acquisition environment. This NASA Research Announcement solicits instrument design, engineering model construction, lab demonstrations, and field demonstrations for innovative measurement techniques that have the highest potential to meet the objectives of the IIP and the measurement capability requirements of the NASA Earth Science Program. The IIP is envisioned to be flexible enough to accept instrument and measurement concepts at various stages of maturity, and through appropriate risk reduction activities (such as design, construction of laboratory breadboards and engineering models, and field demonstrations on the ground or on airborne platforms), advance the system's technology readiness to that necessary to compete successfully in future science solicitations or New Millennium Program space flight demonstrations. The proposer must define the starting point for the instrument or measurement technique and the exit or success criteria for the proposed activity. The following science measurements are solicited from this IIP NRA: ·  Topography and surface change ·  Gravity field Measurement ·  Tropospheric profiles of O3, CO, NOx from GEO ·  Atmospheric temperature, moisture and rainfall from GEO ·  Sea ice thickness and snow cover ·  Coastal region change from GEO ·  Innovative technologies supporting measurement concepts from the L1 or L2 libration points. Proposals for other technology developments that do not address the needs as described previously will be considered non-responsive and will not be evaluated. The NRA will be available electronically on the release date, via the Internet at the Research Opportunities home page at  http://research.hq.nasa.gov/research.cfm  under ''Office of Earth Science (Code Y)''. This announcement will be open for the period from July 16, 2002 through September 5, 2002, and proposals may be submitted at any time throughout that period.

<SOLNBR>RFQ-02-163-UHP
<RESPDATE>071702
<ARCHDATE>08012002
<CONTACT>Uyen Phuong, Lead Purchasing Agent, Phone 301 496-6127, Fax 301 402-8169, Email PHUONGU@mail.nlm.nih.gov - Karen Riggs, Contracting Officer, Phone 301 496-6546, Fax 301 402-0642, Email RIGGSK@mail.nlm.nih.gov
<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional Japanese rare book cataloging services on a sole source basis from Ms. Sachie Kobayashi.  The NLM has approximately 1700 titles in Japanese, consisting of printed books (60%), manuscripts (30%), periodicals (5%), and visual materials (5%) dating from the 15th to the early 20th century which have only minimal records in the library catalog, OCLC and RLIN, and occasionally lack records altogether.  The records, which exist usually, lack proper transcriptions and standard descriptive cataloging, including name authority work.  An historian of Japanese medicine has examined the books and made notes and written historical abstracts in Japanese and cited bibliographies for many of them.  Attached to these notes are photocopies of the title pages, colophons, and cover title pieces.

The purpose of this procurement is to obtain cataloging services for the library's rare Japanese medical collection.   The project entails: 1) examining photocopies and original copies of title pages, colophons, and other information of books, manuscripts and visual materials, as well as notes already prepared about the materials by an historical consultant; 2) searching titles in the OCLC WorldCAT, Kokusho somokuroku (Tokyo: Iwanami Shoten, 1989-1991), and other bibliographical sources; 3) creating or updating records for each item in OCLC or RLIN and exporting bibliographic records into NLM's local catalog and editing them there, all to the standards of Anglo-American Cataloging Rules (Chicago: ALA, 1998.) and Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Books (Washington, DC: LC, 1991); 4) creating or updating name authority records for authors, editors, illustrators, former owners or other added entries needed for the bibliographic records.

 Ms. Sachie Kobayashi is the only known source capable of providing the cataloging services noted above.  Ms. Kobayashi has a Master's Degree in Library Science and is fluent in spoken and written Japanese with an Associate's Degree from Yamanashi Eiwa College in Japan.  Ms. Kobayashi has 8 years of experience in cataloging Japanese materials for Yamanashi Eiwa College, Kofu City Library, the University of Maryland and the Library of Congress.  Ms. Kobayashi is currently obtaining training in Japanese rare book cataloging at the Library of Congress using LC standards and the rules laid out in Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Books.

The period of performance will be on-site for one (1) year with an option for one additional one-year period.  The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition.  This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner which will be considered by NLM.  Firms interested in responding to the notice must be able to provide the referenced services as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposal must include pricing information. NLM Synopsis No. NLM 02?163/UHP.  Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to Uyen H. Phuong, Lead Purchasing Agent, NLM on (301) 496-6127 or by email at phuongu@mail.nlm.nih.gov.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute, Division of Clinical Sciences, Clinical Proteomics Reference Lab intends on entering into a sole source contract with Tecan US, 4022 Stirrup Creek Road, Suite 310, Durham, NC 207703 for a Robotic Sample Handling System with accessoriies.  The primary focus of the Clinical Proteomics Reference Lab is the advancement of common research interests shared by CBER and NCI in the application and development of proteomic technology to the diagnosis and treatment of human cancer.  The formation of Clinical Proteomics Reference Lab was approved with the goal of providing approved methods and specifications of utilizing proteomic patterns for diagnostic purposes.  The use of proteomic pattern evaluation for the diagnosis of Ovarian Cancer was developed and published by CPRL.  In order to bring this methodology to the public in as rapid a fashion as possible, CPRI intends to file a Pre-market Application(PMA) to the Food and Drug Administration for approval as a method for aid in the diagnosis of ovarian cancer in high risk populations.  As part of the research effort to demonstate the method feasibility, a determination has been made that the consistency of sample and reagent application was critical to obtaining high quality results, therefore, it would be necessary to utilize instrumenttion for this purpose rather than depend on manual functions which are not reliable, reproducible or consistent.  An instrument was obtained and modified in-house for this purpose and consistent results were obtained.  However, it is necessary to develop and optimize the methodology under the mandate of design control (CFR Part 820). This requires an instrument that is flexible in design for the optimization and must be provided by a company that can provide a configuration which can be specified for performance as part of a PMA.  The characteristics of such instrumentation are provided by a company whose focus is robotic instrumentation for serum handling and processing.  Because of the PMA filing, the instrument must be developed and manufactured under design controls as mandated by 21 CFR Part 820.  Tecan US is the only source known to the Government that can provide a system which can provide this service for this technique.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements,it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office no later than 1:30 PM EST on July 10, 2002.  This action is pursuant to 41 USC 253(1) and under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The requirement will be procured as a commercial item in accordance with FAR Part 12.102(c) under the test program.  If you have any questions, please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent(301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collects calls will be accepted.  The NAICS Code 334516.

<DESC>The Department of Justice (DOJ) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a contract with CaseSoft, 5000 Sawgrass Village Circle, Ponte Vedra Beach, FL 32082 for the purchase of CaseMap and TimeMap (and related utility NoteMap and TextMap programs) licenses and on-going five-year maintenance and support for use by attorneys throughout the DOJ.  The anticipated date for contract award is August 15, 2002 

The DOJ has a growing need to analyze increasing amounts of data related to both affirmative and defense litigation and in the organization of evidence for trial.  Further, the DOJ needs to be able to track different types of data elements, which vary from case to case, and to analyze that information and display the inherent relationships between those elements.  Specifically, the DOJ needs software that will (1) analyze data automatically to produce cross-references and identify relationships between elements based on information entered by the user as well as by the categories and priorities assigned by the user, (2) provide efficient shorthand data entry features which insure data uniformity and consistency, (3) produce a timeline based on the dates and descriptions, (4) allow the user to print the timeline in large scale format to display to the jury, (5) allow the user to electronically display a timeline to a jury, and (6) integrate with existing DOJ litigation support packages including Summation, Concordance, and Trial Presentation - Sanction.

The DOJ has completed market research and has determined that CaseSoft is the only responsible supplier who can provide the software license and maintenance to meet the stated DOJ need.  CaseSoft's CaseMap/TimeMap is the only known software package that will meet the DOJ's need.  Currently 17,000 users in DOJ's US Attorneys and Tax Divisions are using CaseSoft's CaseMap/TimeMap to effectively satisfy the stated need.  The DOJ intends to contract with CaseSoft to extend CaseMap and TimeMap to additional attorneys throughout the DOJ.  

There is no solicitation document.  Interested parties must submit a detailed response, to include descriptions and product literature that clearly and convincingly demonstrate the ability to meet the DOJ needs.  Responses received as a result of this notice of intent will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Responses will not be considered as proposals or bids, and cost and pricing data are not solicited.  A determination by the DOJ not to open this requirement to competition based upon any written responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the DOJ.  Responses are due by July 18, 2002.

<CONTACT>Xinia Llovet-Zurinaga, 508-233-4146
<DESC>NA The US Army Soldier Systems Center, Product Manager – Force Sustainment Systems, Natick, MA, has a requirement for a Cargo Parachute Release to be used for the 500 Foot Low Velocity Airdrop System (500’ LVADS).  The new Cargo Parachute Release will eventua lly replace the current M-1 and M-2 Cargo Parachute Releases so as to provide a more reliable, lower maintenance, lower weight, and lower cost release.  This new Cargo Parachute Release, used with either a single or clustered parachute configuration, shall  have the following performance characteristics: capable of delivering combat loads having suspended weights between 200 pounds through 42,000 pounds (Objective) (200 pounds through 15,500 pounds (Threshold); capable of withstanding the forces typically as sociated with LVAD operations from military cargo aircraft traveling between 130-150 knots indicated air speed (KIAS).  The release shall hold from 1 to 8 cargo parachutes. The release shall be easy and quick for an Army rigger to attach to each of the 4 p latform slings and to each parachute riser. The Cargo Parachute Release shall be designed to allow each parachute to be released separately from the other parachutes and the load. The release shall be capable of releasing the parachute(s) when the platform  impacts the ground and release equally, in any direction, in ground wind speeds of 17 knots (threshold) (21 knots (objective)).  Please note that, for LVAD operations, the maximum rate of descent at ground impact will not exceed 28.5 ft/sec.  Any proposed  pyrotechnic device shall already be certified by the Army for military use in the intended application.  Any electrically operated device shall use commercial-off-the-shelf batteries and have a built in test circuit to show that the battery is good and th e electrical circuit is ready to fire. Emphasis on durable lightweight materials and low/simplified maintenance is highly desired.  Proposals that discuss existing release designs, which provide valid test data demonstrating substantial compliance with 500 ’ LVADS performance requirements, will be more favorably considered than entirely new design or engineering approaches. Proposal evaluation will include, but not be limited to, the following processes: An RFP will be issued and offerors’ proposals will be evaluated to determine the item’s ability to meet the above requirements.  A competitive range will be established and offerors of proposals that fall within the range will be issued pre-contract award purchase orders for 1-3 cargo parachute releases to be  tested and evaluated.  These cargo parachute releases will be purchased for preliminary evaluation to determine their capacity to meet the requirements defined above.   These 1-3 cargo parachute releases shall be ready for testing within 60 days after iss uance of purchase order.  Offerors will be required to provide rigging, repair, and technical support during these tests, and will be compensated for such support as a separate Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) in the purchase order.  A down select will occ ur at the conclusion of the Government’s pre-contract award test and evaluation.  The down select will be based on the offeror’s written proposal, including supporting analytical or test data, drawings of their product, and the results of the Government te st and evaluation of the cargo parachute release samples.  The down select will result in the Government awarding a Cost Plus Fixed Fee type contract, with options, to a single offeror.  The contract will include a Base Effort for Design Validation (DV) an d contract options for Developmental and Operational Testing (DT/OT).  The Base Effort’s DV and the DT option will include CLINs for cargo parachute releases, engineering, rigging, and technical support for each respective test effort.  The Base Effort wil l require three (3) cargo parachute releases and will be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee type contract.  Test items will undergo evaluation for fit, form and function, an d will also be subjected to airdrop testing.  The Government may exercise Option 1 upon successful completion of the Base Effort.  Option 1 will require the delivery of six (6) cargo parachute releases.  These systems will be subjected to DT to determine i f they satisfy all the performance requirements identified in the Operational Requirements Document (ORD).  Option 2 is to deliver ten (10) production representative cargo parachute releases.  These items will be subjected to OT to determine if they satisf y all the 500’ LVADS operational effectiveness and suitability requirements.  Option 2 will also include the requirement for the delivery of a Technical Data Package (TDP) (to include complete drawings, lists, and detailed specifications).  In addition, Op tion 2 will also require that the Offeror sell the Government the data rights for the 500’ LVADS Cargo Parachute Release.

The deck blaster, while being manually controlled by an operator, will simultaneously blast and vacuum a horizontal surface. During operation of the deck blaster, the vacuum generation & filtration system will evacuate the wastewater and paint chips from the blaster, process the solid waste for disposal, and filter the water for reuse in the high pressure pump. For blasting other surfaces using the manually operated guns, the Vacuum & Filtration System will not be used. All accessories such as pumps, tanks, hoses, interconnecting piping/fittings, and control boxes necessary for this process shall also be provided by the offeror to satisfy the requirements of this specification. This procurement will be firm fixed price, includes requirements for logistics and technical data, and has provisions for a small amount of contract options.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology (NE), US Department of Energy (DOE), in cooperation with the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of the Republic of Korea (ROK) is interested in receiving Field Work Proposals (FWPs) for collaborative scientific and engineering research and development (R&D) with participants from the ROK in the field of nuclear energy under the International Nuclear Energy Research Initiative (I-NERI).  The I-NERI program is designed to support innovative collaborative research on a bilateral basis to address the principal technical and scientific obstacles to future use of nuclear power world-wide. The Department initiated I-NERI program development and planning early in Fiscal Year 2001.  The bilateral US/ROK collaborative R&D program awarded six I-NERI projects to US/ROK teams in December 2001 as a result of the 2001 I-NERI program solicitation.  This solicitation is intended to expand the number and scope of projects in the US/ROK collaboration as part of the ongoing development of the I-NERI program with cooperating counties from around the globe. A memorandum of understanding (MOU) between US-DOE and ROK-MOST, dated June 14, 1996, as subsequently amended, constitutes the umbrella agreement for cooperative R&D between DOE and MOST in broad fields of study.  The bilateral US/ROK I-NERI collaboration in nuclear energy development was formally authorized and initiated with the mutual approval by DOE and MOST of Annex V to the US/ROK MOU dated May 16, 2001. This program announcement applies only to FWPs from DOE national laboratories for US/ROK collaborations under I-NERI where the laboratory is the lead US performing organization that will be responsible for the proposed work. Where DOE laboratories are included secondarily in international collaborative arrangements with non-federal organizations, and not as lead performers, such joint proposals should be submitted in response to the separate, but equivalent Financial Assistance Solicitation Number DE-RPO6-02RL14400.  DOE laboratories participating in a proposal led by a non-federal party must also submit separate FWPs for their portions of the joint proposal in accordance with the guidelines in this RFP and the practices and procedures of their respective local DOE operations offices. The FWPs for I-NERI grants under this solicitation must reflect collaborative arrangements for cooperative R&D involving at least one participant from the US and one participant from the ROK.  The ROK participants will be funded under separate financial support from MOST.  Participation of ROK parties in I-NERI will be invited through a separate, but equivalent solicitation being issued by MOST simultaneously with this program announcement.  Collaborative arrangements may involve US and ROK federal and non-federal organizations, in lead roles and/or as subcontractors.   The work scope and corresponding funding of all participants must be separately identified in the applications.  A single proposal shall be jointly prepared by the US and ROK lead organizations and shall be submitted by the lead organizations in response to this Program Announcement for each collaborative R&D project.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS TO DELETE THE LANGUAGE REFLECTED UNDER THE DESCRIPTION HEADING OF THE COMBINED SYNOPSIS/REQUEST FOR QUOTATION POSTED IN THE JULY 2, 2002, EDITION OF THE FEDBIZOPS AND REPLACE WITH THE FOLLOWING: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to negotiate a sole source, commercial item contract with Fluent Inc., 10 Cavendish Court, Lebanon, NH 03766 for renewal of  the annual software maintenance Fluent and Fluent/UNS Software and to purchase additional perpetual licenses, serial and parallel processes licenses which are currently being used for a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) code and support.   The Government intends to negotiate solely with FLUENT, Inc., for a firm fixed price contract.  The period of performance is one base year with four one-year options.  The FLUENT code is needed because it is the only mature code with a fully unstructured grid arrangement, automatic grid adaption, and a full   proprietary RNG turbulence model.  FLUENT's unstructured grid allow users to create solution meshes on complex geometries with minimal effort.  FLUENT's hybrid unstructured mesh allows the user to combine element types to suit the needs of the individual problems and can minimize the number of mesh cells needed.  Automatic grid adaption allows the user to refine the mesh automatically in regions where large gradients in the problem exist.  This is an important aspect of CFD analysis.  FLUENT also contains proprietary RNG turbulence model which will allow the NRC to model some turbulent flows with improved results over some other turbulence models.  The FLUENT code is a mature unstructured code with the ability to model boundary conditions and fluid properties in more detail and with more flexibility than upcoming (newer)  limited physics unstructured codes.  Parallel processing will allow the code to run on two CPU's and therefore reduce the time it takes to obtain solutions.   Interested respondents must submit written capability statement including technical information sufficient to demonstrate a bona fide capability to meet this requirement to the address shown above no later 15 calendar days from date announcement appears in the Federal Business Opportunities.  Telephonic responses and responses providing insufficient information for evaluation will not be considered. Direct all questions or inquiries to the telephone numbers provided below.

<DESC>Amendment 2 clarifies NIST's technical requirements and extends the proposal delivery date as follows:

Clarifies paragraphs 1 and 3 of Attachment I - Specifications for Laser Tracker System, any approach that achieves the required accuracies, will be acceptable.  The angular coverage required for roll is 360 degrees and the angular coverage required for pitch and yaw is 180 degrees  (360 degrees is preferred).  

With respect to paragraph 14 of Attachment I - Specifications for Laser Tracker System, NIST uses many different devices on which to mount antennas in the antenna lab.  Several antennas may need to be aligned at the same time.  The requirement for 6 targets is to give the flexibility needed to align several antennas relative to each other.  

Proposal Due Date:

The new proposal due date is Friday, July 12, 2002, at 3:00 p.m.  If you have already sent a proposal and would like to submit a revised proposal, your new proposal shall be marked "Revised Proposal #1."  (Please note that since no changes are being made to the NIST specifications, a new proposal is not necessary.)

<DESC>NAICS Code: 421830   The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Quantum Analytics under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 to provide an analytical system to measure Endocrine Disruptor Compounds (EDCs) in solid and liquid matrices. Classical analytical chemical concentration techniques cannot be used with EDCs. EDC samples frequently contain naturally occurring organic compounds that interfere with Gas Chromatograph / Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) procedures unless removed. The solution to this problem is a GC/MS with large volume injection and integrated  sample cleanup system.   This notice is not a request for quotations.  EPA source research indicates the Quantum Analytics is the only source that can provide a GC/MS system with both a large volume injection and a sample cleanup system. Quantum adds their system, called the "Apex Prosep 800 XT-6,  Programmable Separation Inlet," to an Agilent GC/MS to create the analytical system needed.    However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the statement of work.  Such documentation must be  submitted within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to  conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The applicable NAICS code is 421830. The anticipated award date is 7/24/02. Interested parties should submit a request to Mr. Josh  Bowers, using the following methods: 1.) by fax to 513.487.2109, or 2.) by email (bowers.joshua@epa.gov) referencing solicitation PR-OH-02-00391. No telephone requests will be honored.

<DESC>The synopsis issued on 24 January 2002 by the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWARSYSCOM) for Request for Proposals No. N00039-02-R-0001 is revised in its entirety to read as follows: The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) intends to issue Request for Proposals (RFP) No. N00039-02-R-0001 for the award of a Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for Po Sheng Program Systems Integration. The Po Sheng Program is a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program to provide enhanced Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) capability for Taiwan Air, Sea, Land, and Joint Defense Platforms and Command/Operation Centers. Issuance of the RFP is subject to approval of the Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) of the FMS case. The prospective contract will be for one base period of 18 months plus five (5) one-year option periods. This is a full and open competition. However, only companies holding a current U.S. Department of Defense CONFIDENTIAL (or higher) facility security clearance or appropriately cleared Taiwan companies may obtain and respond to the prospective solicitation. Qualified prospective offerors will access the solicitation via electronic means only from the SPAWARSYSCOM Virtual Program Office (VPO) web site entitled ?PMW-159 TDLP Phase 2? (URL is https://vpo.spawar.navy.mil). Any amendments, when issued, will also be available only on this web site. A Bidders Mailing List will not be established and hard copies of documents will not be provided.  All personnel having access to this RFP or access to information concerning the procurement after contract award, to include subcontractor personnel, must be US citizens or Taiwan citizen personnel. A CONFIDENTIAL security clearance will be required for all personnel with access to U.S. CONFIDENTIAL information, Taiwan CONFIDENTIAL information, Taiwan RESTRICTED information, and Taiwan unclassified information provided on the condition of being treated ?in confidence?.   Qualified entities may obtain access to the VPO by: (1) Going to the VPO web site and making an on-line request for the PMW-159 TDLP Phase 2 VPO. For the blocks related to ?person who can confirm your need for access?, insert Jon Wester, phone (619) 524-7176, e-mail westerj@spawar.navy.mil; AND (2) Sending an e-mail request directly to Jon Wester (telephone requests will not be honored). This request shall state the company?s name, address, Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, and point of contact name, e-mail and telephone number. Also, the request shall include a signed and dated copy of a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) on company letterhead.  The NDA shall state the following: ?[Company Name] understands that certain information related to the prospective Request for Proposals (RFP) No. N00039-02-R-0001 is considered classified and/or sensitive by the Taiwan Government and that such information will be marked to indicate that it is restricted for the eyes of U.S. and/or Taiwan citizens only. [Company Name] agrees to limit its employees? access to all such RFP information in accordance with the marked restriction. [Company Name] also agrees to limit dissemination of all RFP information outside its company to firms that have a Department of Defense CONFIDENTIAL facility security clearance or are appropriately cleared Taiwanese companies. [Company Name] also affirms that it will obtain an agreement with the same language contained herein from any firm to which it disseminates RFP information.? Requesters shall forward the NDA as an attachment to the e-mail request and include an electronic signature or be formatted as a scanned version of a signed hardcopy. Parties approved for VPO access will be notified by e-mail. PARTIES WHO HAVE ALREADY BEEN GRANTED ACCESS TO THE VPO SITE NEED NOT RE-APPLY.  Notification of the release of important solicitation announcements (such as the date of RFP issuance, etc) will be made via the SPAWAR E-Commerce Web Page at http://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil. This site is different from the VPO. Thus, it is essential that parties approved for VPO access also review the SPAWAR E-Commerce Web Page regularly.

<DESC>Fort Pierce, Florida, New Construction, Design Phase, United States District Court,
Small Business Subcontracting Networking Session.

On Monday, August 5, 2002, The United States General Services Administration (GSA), will conduct a Small Business Subcontracting Networking Session for prospective Small Business Subcontractors/Consultants for the design phase of the new United States District Court. The Networking Session will be conducted from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. in the Old Fort Pierce City Hall, 2nd Floor, 315 Avenue A, Fort Pierce, Florida. 

The facility to be constructed will be occupied by The U.S. District Court, The U. S. Magistrate Court, The U.S. Bankrupty Court, The U.S. Probation Service, U.S. Pretrial Services, The U.S. Attorney, The U.S. Marshal Service and GSA.  The Estimated Total Porject Cost (ETPC) is between $20,000,000 and $24,000,000 and most design and construction disciplines are expected to be represented.

The Subcontracting Networking Session is intended to affirm GSA?s recognition of the talent that exists in the Small Business Community and its commitment to opening a dialogue between that community and the firms that have been Short-Listed as the prospective Architect/Engineer for this project.

Prospective Small Business Subcontractors/Consultants will be given an opportunity to network with the Short-Listed Architect/Engineer firms and to showcase their special talents and abilities as qualified Subcontractors/Consultants.  Because GSA is not permitted by law to be a party to contractual relationships between Primes and Subcontractors/Consultants, any contracts that may develop between potential Primes and Subcontractors/Consultants as a result of the Networking Session will be strictly private arrangements between the interested parties based on perceived ability and need.

Questions about the Networking Session may be directed to either David Gibson, GSA?s Small Business Outreach Specialist, Telephone (404) 331-2366, E-Mail DavidA.Gibson@GSA>GOV; or Pat Geisinger, GSA?s Small Business Technical Advisor, Telephone (404) 331-3031, E-Mail Pat Geisinger@GSA.OV.

<DESC>SUBJ:  Sources sought for medical/surgical items This is a Market Survey and Request for Samples to locate potential sources for the standardization of various medical/surgical items.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) desires to offer its customers, on a national basis, the best possible products and prices and to offer its contractors more opportunities within the system.  The intent of the standardization program is to establish national mandatory sources for medical/surgical items to standardize VA’s purchasing of products.  BIDS/OFFERS ARE NOT BEING SOLICITED AT THIS TIME.  A request for quotations will be issued at a later date.  Companies interested in having their items evaluated for possible inclusion in the standardization process should carefully review the item descriptions listed below.  If a company can provide any of these items, SAMPLES OF ALL ITEMS AVAILABLE THAT MEET OR EXCEED THE CRITERIA PROVIDED IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED AT THIS TIME.  Additional criteria may be added (or existing criteria deleted) during the evaluation process.  If this occurs, all samples received will be evaluated equally against the revised criteria.  All samples submitted must be clearly marked with the name of the potential offeror, the product number, and the manufacturer’s name.  NOTE:  ALL SAMPLES SUBMITTED MUST BE MANUFACTURED IN A DESIGNATED COUNTRY, A CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRY, OR A NAFTA COUNTRY (UNITED STATES, CANADA, AND MEXICO).  THE USER GROUP WILL ONLY EVALUATE SAMPLES MANUFACTURED IN APPROVED COUNTRIES.  A LISTING OF DESIGNATED COUNTRIES AND CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRIES MAY BE FOUND AT THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE: http://www.arnet.gov/far/current/html/25.html#25.003.  Potential offerors must also include any corresponding detailed product literature with the samples.  Detailed product literature should include, but not be limited to, an indication of what materials the products are comprised of (e.g. latex, etc.), country of origin, and a listing of sizes, configurations, etc. available.  If detailed literature is not received with the samples, the technical evaluation panel may be unable to fully evaluate the samples and the products could be eliminated from further consideration.  If the detailed literature provided does not sufficiently address all of the listed criteria, the product may be eliminated from further consideration without further discussion. **Please send samples (number of samples required follow each product name) and corresponding detailed product literature to: Department of Veterans Affairs, Item Management Division (049A5S), ATTN:  Carl Hunter, Building 37, First Avenue - One Block North of Cermak Road (22nd Street), Hines, IL  60141.**  Companies submitting samples are also encouraged to obtain Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contracts for those products from the respective government contract office.  VA intends to award a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) against an FSS contract rather than issuing a formal solicitation for the purpose of standardization.  Those companies who do not have their products on an FSS contract will be eliminated from the competition.  VA will use the items submitted in response to this request for samples and the results of the evaluations performed on those items to determine which companies are requested to participate in the resulting Request for Quotations. The VHA Medical/Surgical User Group, a group of VA physicians, nurses and clinicians who have expertise and knowledge of the products, will review and technically evaluate any samples submitted.  VA deems the members of the User Group to be medical experts.  Therefore, they are qualified to determine which products are acceptable.   NOTE: SAMPLES FOR ANY ITEM THAT INCLUDES A REQUIREMENT THAT THE PRODUCT  MEETS A SPECIFIC STANDARD (e.g. AAMI, ASTM, etc.) MUST INCLUDE LITERATURE OR A LETTER FROM THE MANUFACTURER INDICATING HOW THE PRODUCT MEETS THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT. SAMPLES AND PRODUCT LITERATURE MUST BE RECEIVED NO LATER THAN JULY 24, 2002.  Companies not submitting samples by the above date may be eliminated from consideration on any subsequent procurement action for these items.  For additional information regarding contracting issues please contact Sue Proctor (708) 786-5182.  For additional information regarding submission of samples please contact Carl Hunter (708) 786-7783. Product Descriptions/Criteria for items being considered at this time are as follows: ITEM 1.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION

The Forest Inventory and Analysis program (FIA) of the USDA Forest Service is seeking information on technologies for field data collection, quality assurance/control and submittal to a central data processing facility and the corporate database which is currently Oracle 8i.  THIS IS NOT A COMMITMENT FOR SERVICE.  After an initial information-gathering period, if FIA then decides to contract vendors who have expertise in this area and an interest in working with us to develop the necessary tools, a separate bid process will be initiated.

The system will include support of 450+ data recorders that operate in an occasionally connected environment.  The system must support collection of all national core variables, as well as provide easy customization to include regional variables specific to each of its five stations (geographic areas).  In some cases, specific variables need to be added by state.  National core variables include data on trees, soils, vegetation, ozone content, down woody debris, etc.  Regional variables typically expand on these core variables and provide information on items of regional interest, such as regional tree damages (e.g., disease, insects) or tree grading.  The data collection process needs to include verification of legal ranges for each value as well as extensive cross-checking between variables within tables and between tables.  

A Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) system must also be incorporated that allows plot data verification to log and compare QA/QC crew values with original field crew values.  Final edited data will integrate with the corporate Oracle database at national level.  The prospective system must allow the Forest Service full access to any custom code.  This will allow modification of the system as needed throughout its life cycle to meet our changing needs.  Other requirements, such as geographic information systems and/or GPS integration, are very desirable to be included at some point in the system design, but are not a top priority in the initial implementation.    


PROOF-OF-CONCEPT (POC) PROCESS

Technology is changing at a very rapid pace.  There are many system development options available for the mobile computing environment.  The Proof-of-Concept process that we are conducting will be to gain knowledge on available solutions and evaluate usability, maintainability, and integration capabilities with our corporate database (currently residing within Oracle 8i).  The goal of the POC is to determine the specific ?architecture? that is most appropriate for FIA.  The POC results will be reviewed by the entire field data recorder community of the Forest Service, as a part of our internal information sharing.  

We are inviting you to prepare a POC system to demonstrate to the FIA PDR (Portable Data Recorder) Team.  This is in no way intended to be a complete prototype, but rather to provide one or two examples of each requirement listed.  Although we would prefer to see a system that is based on the included Oracle export database (FIAField.dmp), we will view systems that have a similar background database structure and can demonstrate the items we have specifically identified under ?Items to Include in Demonstration?.  The presentation will include an overview of the proposed system architecture, demonstration of the items requested, and an overview and demonstration (where possible) of the specific concepts found under ?Main Concepts?.  A number of handhelds will be provided for testing and interactive demos.  You may choose to bring your own handhelds, but we also request that sample software can be installed on two of the handhelds that we provide.  Specific handhelds are posted  under ?Items Provided?.   

The meeting will take place the last two weeks in August at the Rocky Mountain Research Station (RMRS) in Ogden, UT.  We expect the presentation and interactive demo to be approximately 90 minutes in length with a 30 minute question/answer period to follow.  This time may have to be adjusted depending on the number of respondents to this POC.  If you would like to participate in this process, please respond by July 19, 2002.  Details of the August POC Demo Schedule will be sent after confirmation of vendor interest.  A second confirmation will be required on or before August 9, 2002 after being assigned a time slot to verify you will have a system to demonstrate.  


FIA OBJECTIVES

To determine an appropriate architecture for our system and verify the need for pursuing a Request For Proposals to develop our system.  Our overall timeframe for this system includes system development winter/spring 2003, extensive field testing throughout the development process beginning summer (field season) 2003, and implementation beginning nationwide for the 2004 field season.  Full implementation must be completed by the 2005 field season.  


MAIN CONCEPTS (Requested Written Responses, Demos if Possible)

Please respond to the following concepts in writing, and where possible include in your recommended system architecture design.  If not included in your system design, please provide a detailed explanation describing why you are not recommending the use of that particular ?concept?.  If included in your system design, please include in your demonstration.

1.	What would be the best way to manage a national data collection program that would allow maintenance of national core variables separate from regional variables?  This would basically be the equivalent of maintaining five individual systems that share a common national core.  In some cases, customization may need to go beyond even this to the state level.

2.	We are interested in the concept of an ?application generator?.  This program would recreate applications for data recorders based on the database fields specified (e.g., National core variables plus  North Central variables) and the data recorder specified.  Once an application was generated for the specified region, then it could be customized to allow for specific crew preferences (e.g., order of variables, pick lists, ?).  Please explain whether this would be a viable option for the FIA system or outline your suggestion for a better approach.  Could further customization be made available to the user on the data recorder?  Could multiple configurations be saved for easy-to-select settings?

3.	Is it possible to maintain one program, possibly using an application or forms generator, for use on multiple data recorders with different screen orientations and sizes?  How difficult and/or easy would this be and what would be the related opportunity cost on maintenance of each different screen size and orientation?

4.	The feasibility of using a development environment that would ?generate? a program that would run on multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, Palm) and its subsequent effect on performance and field usability.  If this is not feasible for your system, please explain.

5.	The feasibility of using a database as a source for data validation criteria.  The database would be used for organizing and maintaining these validation rules, and would be fully searchable and updateable.  It would include range checks, cross checks between fields within a table and cross checks between fields in different tables.  It could contain specific SQL or PL/SQL code that would define the edits and be referenced by the data recorder and desktop edit programs to perform data validation.  (Please see ValidationExamples.zip, especially the Example_SQL_edit_database.doc within.)

6.	The feasibility of utilizing a mobile GIS solution to access coverages and landscape information on the handheld computer to help navigate to a plot.  Once on the plot, the feasibility of collecting our data spatially with our comprehensive validation checks.  Would performance delays slow our crews down working with spatial information and coverages?  How would we manage providing coverages for each plot?  This will include GPS units and may also include technology such as the laser rangefinder for gathering spatial information (heights, distances) on individual trees.  How would your system implement this initially or plan for future integration with these technologies?

7.	The feasibility of having multiple data collection devices on a single plot networked using a wireless technology such as Bluetooth to keep the data sync-ed between the multiple devices.  In addition to networking multiple devices running the data collection forms/software, what are the possibilities for utilizing wireless connections between peripheral devices such as GPS units (just starting to be released with Bluetooth), laser range finders, digital cameras, etc.

8.	After seeing the scope of the project, please provide ballpark cost and time estimates for project completion.  This is not expected to be ?the estimate? for the project, but will allow us to plan for our budget needs and approval for this project.  


ITEMS TO INCLUDE IN DEMONSTRATION
To provide comparable testing for vendors who will not use our database:  Minimum 12 tables with total of 160 fields.

Please document and provide an overview of the proposed system during the presentation.  
State your demo system specifications (Laptop and handheld: speed, memory, processor, ?) and any system development software (e.g., Visual Studio) and database software (e.g., Oracle Standard Edition 9i on laptop, SQL Server CE on the handheld) and include in written overview.

Plan to demonstrate your handheld software on a minimum of two of the machines listed under ?Items Provided?.

System development and maintenance:
1.	Drop a variable and corresponding edits from the national core.
2.	Add a tree variable that only appears when the tree status is recorded as ?1? or ?live?.  Include the corresponding edits to the NC regional variable list.
3.	Change the order of the variables on the handheld form
4.	Change the datatype of a field.
5.	Add a range/value edit showing each step.  Also demonstrate validating from a list of values instead of a range.
6.	Add a cross-field validation rule showing each step.
7.	Add a cross-table validation rule showing each step.
8.	Replication system: demonstrate available settings.
9.	Initiate/setup auto-handheld software update and demonstrate.

FIA_POC_Introduction.doc
This document in Word format.

FIA_System_Requirements_7_2_02.doc  
This document contains software requirements that FIA is planning to incorporate into the final system design.  (Hardware requirements are not included in this POC.  At this point, FIA is planning on making hardware selections on a station by station basis once a system is developed. 

NCCoreManual_ver1_6.pdf
The North Central Research Station (NCRS) Field Manual v1.6.  This will match a good portion of the data in the Oracle export file.  Please Note:  Phase 2 (P2) Inventory variables are defined in Sections 1-8.  They typically consist of ?tree data? that are collected on all forested plots.  Phase 3 (P3) Inventory variables are described in Sections 9-14 and are only collected on a subset of the forested plots.  The sample database FIAField only includes the P3 variables that make up additional tree data (Section 12).  The new national system will include all of the variables found in Sections 9-14; but they are not intended to be included in the POC other than to plan for P3 modules.
 
FIAField_Oracle_dmp.zip
-	Sample FIA Field Database (FIAField.dmp).  This is a portion of a field database being used by the North Central Research Station provided in Oracle export format.  It includes North Central regional variables in addition to the national core variables for all P2 data and P3 tree data only.  Regional variable names are preceded with an "NC" in the column names.  
-	Import Instructions for FIAField.dmp (FIAField_Import_Instructions.doc).  These instructions must be followed carefully to install to your trial copy of Oracle Standard Edition and import the FIAField schema.
-	Crosswalk between columns of the sample database and the NCRS Field Manual v1.6 (FIAField_Columns_to_Manual_v1_6.xls).  This will provide a detailed crosswalk between the FIAField sample database columns and the NCRS Field Manual.  The second worksheet also lists the state-cycle-subcycle combinations that are manual v1.6 compliant.

Set of regional variables from the Southern Research Station (SRS_Regional_Variables.doc).  This word document outlines the variable names and types from the Southern as an additional example to NCRS?s to maintain one national and 5 station-level modules of within the system.  It is intended that the vendor demonstrate a few variables from each of these stations to adequately describe the suggested ?maintenance? of these multiple modules.

ValidationExamples.zip
Here are examples of systems used in FIA to track validation checks.  The validations need to be automated as much as possible to avoid maintenance in multiple locations.  There is a strong possibility of using a database to maintain these edits and their SQL code in a single location that will automatically update both handheld editing software and laptop/desktop editing software.  We are very interested in new ideas and suggestions.
-	National Programming Requirements for National Manual v1.6 (P2-3_programming_requirements_v1.6.doc).  This document lists programming requirements for variables from manual version 1.6 including name, phase, width, business rules, range and list checks, ...
-	National Logic Checks for National Manual v1.6 
(P2-3_logic_checks_v1.6_highlighted.rtf).   This file provides examples of the extensive checking that occurs between data fields and tables.  A few examples have been highlighted to focus on, possibly for inclusion in POC system or something similar.
-	Example of an edits database (Example_SQL_edit_database.doc) currently used for cross-field validation checks of P3 data from the national P3 database.  This is not necessarily the design we are interested, but may provide an idea for an "Edits Database".

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS BUT A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), operated by the University of California  for the Department of Energy (DOE), is preparing a solicitation for the preparation of a Site-Wide Transportation Plan (SWTP). The solicitation is being prepared at the request of and under the technical direction of the Project Management - Site and Project Planning Group (PM-1). By issuing this RFI, we are soliciting sources, information and suggestions for the solicitation, including: appropriate type of contract (firm, fixed-price versus time-and-materials, etc.); feasibility of the requirement (including performance requirements and data requirements); statement of work; proposal instructions, and evaluation criteria (including the approach for assessing past performance information); the availability of reference documents; and any other industry concerns or questions.

We currently anticipate a two-phase solicitation: In Phase One, we would issue a Request for Qualifications (RFQ). Using published evaluation criteria, we would rank responding sources and determine a Short List of the top-rated sources (approximately three). In Phase Two, we would issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to the short-listed sources only and, using published evaluation criteria, rank responding offerors, select the source offering the best value to the government, and negotiate a contract with that top-ranked source. We anticipate that the contract would be on a time-and-materials basis, although we are open to information that supports a firm, fixed-price approach. Furthermore, the foregoing is simply our current thinking and our approach may change, based on various factors, including programmatic, schedule, or budget needs, as well as responses to this RFI.

The selected firm would need to demonstrate transportation planning, traffic engineering, and transportation modeling expertise to develop this plan. The plan would be delivered in hard copy and electronically.  Mapping is to be compatible with LANL's GIS/ArcView map system and MS Word formats. The following is a general statement of the work to be performed.  More detailed tasks and a schedule would need to be developed:

1. Research and analyze existing transportation systems, including existing conditions and capacities on a site-wide basis.  
2. Consider safety and security concerns in the analysis.  
3. Provide existing traffic counts for collector and arterial roads, and major intersections.  
4. Provide 10-year projection of conditions and capacities of collector and arterial roads.  Consider surrounding growth in Los Alamos, White Rock, National Park Service, and Forest Service.
5. Provide 10-year projection of future traffic loads and major intersection requirements based on a list of future construction projects. PM-1 will provide the LANL Ten-Year Comprehensive Site Plan (TYCSP).
6. Identify the most suitable way to accommodate resumption of park and ride shuttle and other transit options.
7. Identify options for resolution of transportation issues as a result of above analysis.
8. Provide transportation infrastructure project recommendations, planning level cost estimates, and project completion schedule.
9. Develop a prioritized list with criteria coordinated with PM-1
10. Document and map plan results and recommendations for integration into the TYCSP and other planning documents.

Responses to this RFI are requested to be submitted no later than August 1, 2002 to Gordon Bergman. Electronic responses are encouraged and should be submitted to gbergman@lanl.gov. If providing the information electronically, please ensure that the information is compatible and accessible using Microsoft Office 2000 software. Faxed responses may be sent to (505) 665-3300. Hard-copy responses may be sent (a) by mail to: Gordon Bergman, Los Alamos National Laboratory, P. O. Box 1663, Mail Stop M986, Los Alamos, New Mexico 87545; or (b) by private courier to: Gordon Bergman, Pajarito Complex, Room 125-127, 3400 Arizona, Los Alamos, New Mexico.

a) Company name, principal point of contact, complete mailing address, phone, email, FAX;
b) Size of business;
c) A concise company history including: major products/services, primary customer base, and point(s) of contact with telephone number(s)
d) A brief overview of the company's experience and past performance in developing plans similar to that outlined above. 
e) A brief description of the company's current ability to perform a plan such as SWTP;
f) Your interest in bidding for this work should a solicitation be issued;
g) Identification of any functions that you would subcontract;
h) DUNS number;
i) Other qualifications, certifications, or other technical information you deem appropriate to aid our assessment; 
j) Vendor List Entry.  Please include a brief List Entry (company name, address, and contact person with telephone, fax, and e-mail information) to be included in a List of Interested Vendors that we will publish on our bidding opportunities/solicitations home-page (http://bus.lanl.gov/bus5/Default.htm). If you do not wish to have your company included in such a list, please clearly state this.

Caveats. Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by us to form a binding contract. If your response to this RFI contains proprietary information, please clearly mark and identify such restricted or proprietary data, present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information, and give us disposition instructions (submitted data will not be returned). This RFI is for market research and planning purposes only. It is not a commercial solicitation per FAR Part 12 nor a request for proposal. We do not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by us will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and our use of such information. We reserve the right to reject in whole or in part any industry input as a result of this RFI. Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds us to solicit for or award a contract or be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties in support of the effort mentioned above. 

After we review responses to this RFI, we may solicit comments on a draft RFQ and/or a draft RFP.  We may also possibly schedule briefings with some of the submitters to gain further market insight. Those companies would be contacted individually.

<SUBJECT>C -- Architectural-Design Services
<DESC>The General Services Administration is providing its notice of intent to procure architectural design services using other than competitive procedures for the firm of Design Associates International, Inc. (DAI), Dallas, Texas, for the renovation of the Federal Plaza at the Fritz G. Lanham Federal Building, located in Fort Worth, Texas.  DAI was originally selected under Brooks Act quality based selection procedures to perform similar design services for the First Impressions Project at the Earl Cabell Federal Building in Dallas, Texas, Fritz G. Lanham Federal Building in Fort Worth, Texas, and the Bob Casey Federal Building in Houston, Texas.  Design services to be provided under this new contract include all plans and specifications to renovate and reconstruct the section of Old Hyde Park that fronts the Federal Building along Throckmorton Street, in coordination with GSA and the City of Fort Worth.  The firm of DAI is uniquely familiar with this project, having been involved with the conceptual design of Federal Plaza for over one year, when it was still part of the First Impressions Project for the Fritz G. Lanham Federal Building (this First Impressions Project has since been split into two separate projects).  The expedited performance through their unique project knowledge and extensive documentation of current conditions would result in less risk to the Government.  The requirement to procure these services through full and open competition would result in an intangible risk to the Government because of the coordination and liability to incorporate the DAI original design components.  Therefore, this procurement is planned as other than full and open competition based on the grounds that DAI is the only practical firm that can provide these design services.  The total estimated range of this action is approximately $80,000 - $110,000.  Firms who are interested in commenting regarding the Government intent, or obtaining additional information regarding the above procurement, should provide their written comments to Trudy Greer, Contracting Officer, phone 817-978-2611, fax 817-978-7508, or e-mail trudy.greer@gsa.gov.  Comments should be received by the Contracting Officer within 30 days of publication of this notice.  NOTE:  DAI is a woman-owned, 8(a) business concern.

<DESC>Dear Colleague: In 2001, the City of Beijing was chosen to host the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. Prior to 2008, Beijing will be implementing the "Green Olympics" program, where billions of dollars will be invested in new infrastructure projects to improve the city's environment.  Central to these investments will be the application of new technologies to improve Beijing?s air quality. The use of fossil fuels dominates China?s energy demographic and China represents a large market for American goods and services in energy fields. Additionally, through the Beijing Green Olympics program, there will be substantial business opportunities for American firms with offerings including clean coal and oil and gas technologies, as well as emissions control systems. The United States Department of Energy is preparing to enter into a dialogue with the Beijing City Government, which is implementing the Green Olympics Program.  We are interested in our stakeholders? view as to how we can effectively use this relationship to develop market share for American firms. If there are specific items that you would like to see included in this dialogue, we would appreciate your input.  Please contact Barbara McKee at e-mail, barbara.mckee@hq.doe.gov, telephone, 301-903-3820 or fax 301-902-1591. Sincerely, Carl Michael Smith Assistant Secretary Office of Fossil Energy
