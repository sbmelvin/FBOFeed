<a href="mailto:marianne.shelley@nasa.gov">Marianne  Shelley</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) has a requirement for Avcoat thermal protection materials and associated engineering services to support the continued development of the Orion Thermal Protection System (TPS) heat shield.  The heat shield protects the space vehicle and its occupants during re-entry into the Earths atmosphere. <p> NASA/ARC intends to purchase the Avcoat materials and associated engineering services from Textron Systems of Wilmington, MA under the statutory authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  <p> In 2009, as a result of several competitive procurements, and after extensive testing and evaluation of many TPS candidate materials, NASA selected Textrons Avcoat as the heat shield material for the Orion spacecraft.  Textron has been, and still is the only producer of the Avcoat material.  In February 2011, NASA ARC awarded contract NNA11AA23B to Textron, and that contract will end in February 2016.  The Orion Program Office Insight/Oversight team is led by NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) to oversee the continued development of the Avcoat heat shield.	ARC is working with JSC on the Insight/Oversight team amongst other NASA centers, and ARC has the responsibility of procuring Avcoat materials for required testing by NASA.  The Textron Avcoat heat shield successfully protected the Orion Flight Test spacecraft on December 5, 2014, and another orbital flight test, EM-1, is scheduled for 2018.  ARC has been given Orion Program direction to continue to procure additional Avcoat materials and associated engineering services to conduct further testing and analysis of Avcoat.  Thus it is necessary to negotiate and award a follow-on contract with Textron in order for ARC to support Orion heat shield development for future Orion missions. <p> The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  <p> Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:00p.m. Pacific time on October 22, 2015.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. <p> Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. <p> All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. <p> NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at <A HREF="http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html">http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/p ub_library/Omb.html </A>    . <p> Information about major upcoming ARC procurement actions is available at <A HREF="http://ec.msfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eis/admin/admin.cgi?">http://ec.msfc.nasa.gov/cgi-b in/eis/admin/admin.cgi? </A>

Synopsis: VA Pre-Solicitation Notice for VISN 06 Nursing Home Facilities

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration, Network Contracting Office (NCO 06), Hampton, VA intends to solicit proposals from contractors in the cities/counties of: Newport News.  This pre solicitation announcement publicizes the Department of Veterans Affairs future intent, to solicit Community Nursing Home Care services at the contractor's facilities, under a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) in the VISN 06 geographical footprint as specified.

The VA anticipates this as an open and continuous solicitation for this requirement. The VA will accept proposals throughout the current fiscal year until 09/30/2016. The solicitation will be available for download from http://www.fbo.gov. Interested contractors will be responsible for downloading copies of the solicitation (and any subsequent amendments) from that website, and no hard copies are available. The solicitation will provide instructions to contractors about the proposal submission process. Prospective Offerors are encouraged to register their interest in the solicitation on the FBO website so that they are notified of the issuance of the solicitation and any amendments. Proposals will be evaluated for award on a periodic basis. 

In accordance with FAR 52.204-7, System for Award Management, prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) under the applicable NAICS. Firms may obtain SAM information at https://www.sam.gov. To be eligible for award, contractors must be registered in SAM.

Patient placements in contract nursing home facilities are based on availability of facilities in a geographical location and the desires of the veterans and their respective families.

The work identified is to be provided by means of a combination Firm-Fixed Price/Indefinite Quantity contract.  Source Selection procedures will be used to select the proposal that provides the lowest price and is technically acceptable to the government.  Offerors will be evaluated using the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Method.  In order to permit efficient competition, the Navy will utilize the following methodology:  Proposal will initially be screened for price and placed in order of price (lowest price to highest price).
  The Navy will then evaluate the technical factors of the five (5) lowest priced proposals.  The Navy will make award to the lowest priced technically acceptable proposal from among the five (5) lowest priced proposals.  However, the Navy, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to increase the number of proposals it will review under this methodology.  Accordingly under this methodology, the technical factors of some proposals may not be evaluated by the Navy.  Proposers are advised that the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award without discussions or any contract concerning the proposals received.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most FAVORABLE terms.
 Proposers should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  If discussions are deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer, all proposals will be evaluated (both technical and price) for the purpose of establishing a competitive range.
The solicitation and resulting contract award will be a performance-based service acquisition made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the Request for Proposals (RFP), will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other evaluation factors considered.  The offerors proposal shall contain a response to each of the evaluation factors and shall be in the form prescribed by the solicitation.
  The solicitation requires the evaluation of price and the following non-price factors: Factor 1  Technical Approach/Management, Factor 2  Corporate Experience, Factor 3  Safety, and Factor 4  Past Performance. NOTE: Offerors MUST be evaluated as technically ACCEPTABLE under factors 1, 2, 3 and 4 in order to be considered technically acceptable overall.
Offers shall be submitted for the performance of work for a period of one year.  However, the initial term of the contract may be for a period of less than one year.  The Government has the option to extend the term of the contract services for additional periods of one to twelve months.

This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in
order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability,
engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s)
require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved
source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that
are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is
essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must
qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved
by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures
must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over
the part in the intended application. The subject item requires Government
source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or
the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support
acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously
approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required
for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed
pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must
submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the
NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures
listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair:
www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required
to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or
similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request for
source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your
offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source
approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source
Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the
Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this
solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted
hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the
ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award
of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs. The NAVSUP
WSS Commercial Item Identification Brochureis now available at:

The program is aimed at achieving affordability in weapon systems acquisition by inserting manufacturing process solutions early in acquisition to reduce life-cycle costs, improve schedules, and ensure quality. For the past eight years, the Navy ManTech Program has been focused on affordability improvements for key acquisition platforms. Currently, ManTech is focused on affordability improvements for the VIRGINIA Class Submarine (VCS) / OHIO Replacement Program (ORP), the DDG51 Class Destroyer, the CVN 78 Class Carrier, the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), and the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). ManTech helps these Navy programs achieve their respective affordability goals by transitioning needed manufacturing technology which, when implemented, results in a cost reduction or cost avoidance. Navy ManTech works with defense contractors, the Naval Research Enterprise, Navy acquisition Program Offices, and academia to develop improved processes and equipment. The Program is structured to promote timely implementation to strengthen the defense industrial base. The Navy ManTech Centers of Excellence (COEs) play a key role in the definition and execution of the Program. With their expertise in specific technology areas, the COEs provide focal points for the development and technology transfer of new manufacturing processes and equipment in a cooperative environment with industry, the acquisition community the Naval Research Enterprise, and academia.<br />The NEMC CoE contractor will perform all supporting functions for the Center of Excellence (CoE), which includes serving as a corporate repository of expertise, performing special projects, conducting industry surveys, planning and conducting outreach activities to increase awareness of the NEMC, and disseminating manufacturing technology throughout the nation's shipyards and industrial base.

<DESC>The United States (U.S.) Army, Army Contracting Command (ACC), Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), Aberdeen, MD, 21005, intends to buy out the remaining seventy-eight (78) Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar (LCMR), AN/TPQ-50 systems to fulfill the Army's Acquisition Objective. The ACC APG is conducting market research to identify possible sources to produce systems that meet the technical performance requirements of the LCMR AN/TPQ-50 Performance Specification.
<p>This notice is published in accordance with Federal Acquisition Part (FAR) Part 10, Market Research and FAR Part 15, Exchanges with Industry before Receipt of Proposal. This notice serves as a Request for Information (RFI) in support of market research. All information received will be used for planning purposes only. This notice does not constitute an Invitation to Bid, a Request for Proposal, or a Request for Quote. The Government will not award a contract based on this notice and will not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with responses to it.</p>
<p>The LCMR AN/TPQ-50 is a lightweight, 360-degree, rapidly deployable, man-transportable, digitally connected, day/night mortar locating radar that uses computer-controlled signal processing of the radar signal data to perform target detection, verification, tracking, and classification of enemy and friendly mortars. It provides simultaneous hostile weapon locations, discrimination and friendly fire observation of mortars, cannons and rockets. The LCMR AN/TPQ-50 has improved range and accuracy for mortars. It is disassembled into man-portable cases which fit into a single up-armored M1152 or equivalent high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle (HMMWV). The LCMR AN/TPQ-50 is assembled and emplaced on or off the vehicle by a two person team. Interoperability and other performance requirements are delineated in the System Performance Specification.</p>
<p>The Army is preparing to either extend or award a follow-on contract to Contract W15P7T-13-D-C702, a fixed price (FP) production contract awarded in July 2013 for LCMR AN/TPQ-50 production representative assets and initial spares. The contract also includes cost plus provisions for support; engineering analysis; and assessment and implementation of potential product improvements. The Government does not possess a build-to-print technical data package (TDP) for the LCMR AN/TPQ-50.</p>
<p>Responses will consist of an unclassified white paper. At a minimum, the white paper shall provide a description of the technical approach and a statement on the ability to meet these key attributes:</p>
<p>a. Schedule. Quantities for the additional ordering periods will vary depending on available funding and other factors. Provide sufficient supporting documentation, to include an integrated schedule showing key events such as contract award, any development and/or facilitization, ramp up, test events and deliveries.</p>
<p>b. Technical Performance. Summarize the current, demonstrated capabilities of any existing system that is relevant to the requirements of the LCMR AN/TPQ-50 Performance Specification.

Documentation may include system technical specifications, product brochures and related literature, performance test data, system drawings and/or photographs, or any other data to support claims. Responses may discuss types, extent, depth and breadth of analysis and data to substantiate performance claims. Responses should identify and summarize previous testing of either individual components of their proposed system, or the integrated system, by either the U.S. Government or other independent test agencies.</p>
<p>c. Technological Maturity and Manufacturing Readiness. Address the maturity of the product design by identifying any systems delivered to date, whether these systems are prototypes or production representative items, the quantity of systems produced to date, test results to date and any relevant field data demonstrating the system performance. Describe your quality processes.</p>
<p>d. Supportability. Address key elements of supportability to include training, technical publications, supply support, repair, and maintenance.</p>
<p>e. Modularity and Open Systems Architecture (MOSA). Discuss system design relative to modularity and open systems architecture, which can accommodate rapid and cost efficient implementation of design changes.</p>
<p>f. Cost. Identify the estimated unit cost of the system, including any quantity breaks. Include unit price and quantity information for relevant previous orders for similar products.</p>
<p>g. Reliability. Provide demonstrated and documented reliability consistent with the requirements of LCMR AN/TPQ-50 Performance Specification, or a reliability growth curve (RGC) with supporting narrative describing how required reliability will be achieved.</p>
<p>h. Production Capability. Provide the estimated minimum and maximum sustained production rates by month/year. Also identify required manufacturing facilities, personnel and all necessary resources to complete the effort.</p>

<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUEST FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. This Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) is in support of Market Research being conducted by the Defense Logistics Agency to identify potential manufacturing/supply sources, and if future efforts can be competitive or Set Aside for Small Business. The proposed multiple North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Codes are identified on Attachment 1 entitled "List of NSNs" This SSS is to notify companies that the Defense Logistics Agency, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, is seeking qualified sources for the Sole Source acquisition of multiple NSNs (see attached Attachment 1) in support of the Patriot Missile Weapon Systems. The data needed to acquire these parts competitively is not physically available, they cannot be obtained economically, nor is it possible to draft adequate specifications or any other adequate, economical description of the materials for a competitive solicitation. As a result, this acquisition is currently being procured under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The Government is interested in all businesses to include 8(a), small business and small disadvantaged business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Hubzone, and Women-Owned small business concerns.

Firms that process the ability and can produce the required item(s) described above are encouraged to identify themselves. Contractors are encouraged to seek source approval in order to compete for future solicitations by accessing the website: http://amcomdmz.redstone.army.mil/casl__cmo/casldba.casl_cmo_samsar and looking under Standardized Aviation and Missile Source Approval Request (SAMSAR). The contractor shall be capable of successfully performing and complying with any and all special requirements in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation annotated above, at the unit prices established at time of a contract award. The contractor will be responsible for recurring and nonrecurring engineering services associated with becoming a qualified source. The contractor will also be responsible for</p>
<p>all aspects of the manufacturing/production process, including but not limited to: supply chain management, logistics, forecasting of parts, long-lead parts procurement, material forecasting, obsolescence issues and final delivery of assets as well as any and all additional costs incurred resulting from contract performance.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: THIS SSS IS ISSUED SOLELY FOR INFORMATIONAL AND PLANNING PURPOSES. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION (REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR REQUEST FOR QUOTATION) OR A PROMISE TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION IN THE FUTURE AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1 with High Precision Devices (HPD) located in Boulder, CO for the procurement of a Model 103 (Rainer) Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator ( ADR ) Cryostat System with rapid cool down option.
<p>No other ADR vendor is capable of providing a means for rapid cool down of the cryostat from room temperature to 4 Kelvin. The usual time for such cool down is greater than 14 hours, whereas HPD has developed technology enabling cool down in less than 5 hours. This enables rapid experimentation and sample exchange, a critical requirement for this application. Additionally, no other vendors are capable of providing no-load hold times at 100 mK or greater than 150 hours. Such long hold times allow for complicated experiments that require long data acquisition periods.</p>
<p>HPD does not license others to utilize their propriety designs. As a result, High Precision Devices is uniquely qualified to provide the required ADR system.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and is required within 5 months after receipt of order.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 or less employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received no later than the response date for this notice of intent.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

Notice of Intent
	
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of North Carolina  Chapel Hill (UNC-CH), Office of Human Research Ethics, for providing Institutional Review Board (IRB) Services for Human Research. The services required are essential for research experiments involving human subjects.  The contractor shall serve as the designated IRB of record; provide review and oversight of EPAs human subject research; coordinate with and establish IRB authorization agreements; provide consultation to EPA staff; and provide training for EPA staff related to ethics and other topics relevant to conducting human research.  The period of performance is anticipated to be 12 months from date of award with four 12 month optional periods of performance.  UNC-CH has five IRBs, each with members who have specialized areas of technical expertise that align with NHEERLs diverse human research program.  These IRBs have provided expert review and oversight to the Environmental Public Health Division (EPHD) for over two decades and as such are familiar with the large number and complexity of NHEERLs often unique research studies.  Other unique qualifications of UNC-CH supporting EPAs beliefs are a preponderance of the human subjects research is conducted in collaboration with UNC-CH; the EPA EPHD is located on the campus of UNC-CH; and the research must be reviewed by UNCs IRB to comply with UNC policy.  Since the majority of human research protocols must be reviewed and monitored by a UNC CH IRB to ensure compliance with UNC policy for on campus research involving UNC staff, the introduction of another IRB would disrupt critical time sensitive on going research resulting in unacceptable delays.  

The circumstances permitting Other than Full and Open Competition at this time is FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.     All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541690, which has a small business size standard of $15.0 million, is applicable.
The intent of this synopsis is to state the Governments intention to sole source this acquisition and to determine if any other source(s) exist, therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  



   Please submit your response to the U.S. EPA, Attn:  Judy Ancharski (AA-005), RTP Procurement Operations Division, 109 Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709.  No telephone or faxed requests will be honored.

RFQ-RT-16-00001

Notice of Intent

The U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with NextBio Research for a one year license to use the NextBio database and integrated tools. This procurement is recommended to be processed without full and open competition.  
 NextBios Research and Translational Medicine system is a web-based discovery platform that provides a practical way to mine vast quantities of complex biological, clinical and literature data. The database integrates the worlds genomic information in ways that enable researchers to develop biomedical insight, incorporating correlative, data-driven discovery that accelerates research by combining semantically structured data and simple user interfaces. 
Preliminary studies using NextBio have been conducted by EPA scientists in collaboration with the National Institute of Environmental Health Studies (NIEHS).   NextBio queries identified chemicals known to activate the transcription factors as expected as well as identified a number of chemicals not previously known to activate that transcription factor.  These studies validate the power of the database for classifying chemicals into different adverse outcome pathways.  The license will be used to derive, test and validate additional signatures that will be used in adverse outcome pathway prediction.  The database is useful for all areas of molecular toxicology and will be open to EPA scientists using genomics to classify chemicals.

NextBio is the only complete database and web-based tool that is available that can be used for prediction of key events in adverse outcome pathways.  NextBio has a number of unique features not offered by any other publically available database or query tool.

Sediments in the Bay are known to contain metals and similar byproducts of the historical industrial activity. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, and Fraser Shipyard have formed a partnership agreement to consider and implement options to mitigate and/or remediate impacted areas. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Detroit District (USACE), is supporting the EPA with project development and implementation of actions to design and execute remedial alternatives.</p>
<p>To expedite development of the project, Fraser Shipyard hired environmental engineering firm ARCADIS to evaluate alternatives. ARCADIS conducted extensive evaluation of the sediment data , provided mapping for concentrations of sediment constituents, and compared those concentrations to regulatory criteria. ARCADIS developed preliminary Dredge Management Units for Howards Bay based on sediment analysis and used GIS mapping to calculate dredging volumes. This information was used to prepare a Focused Feasibility Study (FFS). The Project Partners endorsed the FFS in July 2015 and agreed to move the project into Design and Implementation (D&amp;I) phase. <br /><br /><strong>Scope of Work:</strong><br />Utilizing preliminary engineering, planning, and feasibility documents, provide the following engineering services:<br />1.

Implementing the Mine View Model (MVM) using the sediment concentration database to provide 3-dimensional views of the sediment concentrations; these 3-dimensional images will be used by the project partners to expedite permit reviews;<br />4. Refine the dredge management units identified in the FFS; these will be provided as CADD drawings suitable for including in the contract drawings and specifications;<br />5. Develop contour maps for potential land disposal of impacted materials at authorized landfills;<br />6. Develop and incorporate Enhanced Natural Restoration (ENR) features for some areas in the harbor as part of remedial activities;<br />7. Prepare detailed drawings and specifications for use in remediation/dredging/construction contract;<br />8. Participate and support USACE/EPA in Government reviews and permitting.</p>
<p>Full implementation of this action is subject to the identification of acceptable design alternatives and to the availability of funds for the complete project.</p>
<p><strong>Schedule:</strong><br />The Government intends to enter into a negotiated contract by December 2015. Design plans and specifications would be required by March 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated Value of This Action:</strong><br />Between $250,000 and $500,000.</p>
<p><strong>Set-Aside:</strong><br />None. Small Business Subcontracting Plan required of any large business.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Veteran Affairs, ("VA") Veterans Health Administration ("VHA"), is conducting this Request for Information (RFI) as market research to determine sources and to seek and understand the availability of Medical Walk-in Clinics that could provide basic medical services.  It is the VA's intent to make basic medical services more accessible and available to Veterans around the country.  These centers should be accessible after normal business hours, weekends/holidays, etc.  These centers should also be capable of treating Veterans and their family from across the country (in particular when Veterans are traveling).  
The VHA continues to meet Veterans' changing medical, surgical and quality-of-life needs. New programs provide treatment for traumatic brain injuries, post-traumatic stress, suicide prevention, women Veterans and more. VA has opened outpatient clinics, and established telemedicine and other services to accommodate a diverse Veteran population, and continues to cultivate ongoing medical research and innovation to improve the lives of America's patriots.

VHA operates one of the largest health care systems in the world and provides training for a majority of America's medical, nursing and allied health professionals. Roughly 60 percent of all medical residents obtain a portion of their training at VA hospitals; and VA medical research programs benefit society at-large.
The VA health care system has grown from 54 hospitals in 1930, to include 152 hospitals, 800 community-based outpatient clinics, 126 nursing home care units and 35 domiciliaries.
The information gained from this RFI may be fundamental to shaping the Department's future efforts to improve access to services.

It is VHA's intent to obtain information and open dialog with Subject Matter Experts with adequate facilities capable of providing basic medical services to Veterans.  It is the VA's intent to make basic medical services more accessible and available to Veterans around the country.  These centers should be accessible after normal business hours, weekends/holidays, etc.  These centers should also be capable of treating Veterans and their family from across the country (in particular when Veterans are traveling).

<DESC>This is not a request for competitive proposals. This is a notice of intent to sole source a national Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for enterprise-wide software and hardware maintenance services for the Innovian ARK System, for base year and four (4), one (1) year options. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B), Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized. 

The proposed action is to obtain software and hardware maintenance services for the Innovian ARK System. VHA has previously purchased and installed Innovian ARK perpetual software licenses and hardware from Draeger Medical, Inc.

The Department of Veterans Affairs uses Innovian Anethesia software for electronic documentation in anesthesiology environments.
The Innovian Anesthesia software and hardware, produced and developed by Draeger Medical is a proprietary product. Draeger Medical does not have affiliation or agreements in place with any authorized resellers to resolve technical problems and/or obtain Draeger Medical, Inc. software updates; therefore, Draeger Medical is the only one responsible source that exists to obtain this vital support.



The proposed source for this acquisition is the:

Draeger Medical, Inc.
3135 Quarry Road
Telford, Pennsylvania 18969


The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code established for this requirement is 541511 Custom Computer Programming Services and size standard is $27.5 million.

The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). Price will be examined for reasonableness, realism, and balance.</p>
<p>(b) PAST PERFORMANCE: Next, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information on all offerors based on: (i) responses to the past performance questionnaires for the offeror's past and present efforts provided by their references and (ii) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. To assess performance, the Government will use information submitted by the offeror and other sources, such as other Federal and other governmental agencies, commercial sources, Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) and the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this RFP based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence, or Unknown Confidence as defined in the table below. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably<br /><br />SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br /><br />SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br /><br />LIMITED CONFIDENCE -&nbsp;Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br /><br />NO CONFIDENCE - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br /><br />UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.<br /><br />(1) If the lowest priced evaluated proposal is rated as Substantial Confidence in the past performance assessment, that proposal represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops. Award shall be made to that offeror without further evaluation of any other proposals.</p>
<p>(2) If the lowest priced offeror is not rated as Substantial Confidence, the next lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is rated Substantial Confidence, or until all offerors are evaluated. The Evaluation Team shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision if the lowest priced evaluated proposal is not rated as Substantial Confidence in the past performance assessment.</p>
<p>CONTRACT AWARD</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>Offerors must be registered in the SAM database to receive a contract award. If the Offeror does not become registered in the SAM database within 4 days after receiving notification from the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.</p>
<p>SITE VISIT</p>
<p>An organized site visit has been scheduled. It is highly recommended that offerors attend. Offerors wishing to attend must complete the attached Pre-proposal Conference/Site Visit Reservation Form (Attachment No. 7) and Request for Visit Authorization to Rome Research Site, RRS Form 31 (Attachment No. 8).</p>
<p>Participants must contact the Contract Specialist no later than 13 October 2015, 3 PM (ET) in order to coordinate base access.</p>
<p>The site visit is scheduled for 14 October 2015, 1:00 PM (ET) at Rome Research Site.</p>

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only notice; Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This is issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  The North American Industry classification (NAICS) code is 541199.

This acquisition is being solicited accordance with FAR Part 13.003 and DIAR 1480.504-1, as a total Indian Economic Enterprise Set-aside. The Period of Performance (POP) shall be a multi-year contract from contract award to September 30, 2018. See the SOW for complete performance requirement details. The resultant contract will be awarded as a firm fixed-price contract as defined in FAR 16.2. The Government intends to make a single contract award. See Clause and SOW section for details.

The mission of the Tribal Justice Support Directorate (TJS), a division within the Office of Justice Services (OJS), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Department of the Interior (DOI) is to further the development, operation, and enhancement of tribal justice systems and Courts of Indian Offenses. The United States Congress and the Federal courts have repeatedly recognized that tribal justice systems are the appropriate forum for adjudicating civil disputes and some limited criminal actions within Indian country. Most recently, Congress expanded the criminal jurisdiction of tribal courts under the Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010; and the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013.  To that end, TJS is mandated to provide training, technical assistance and limited funding to tribal justice systems. 25 U.S.C.  3611. In an effort to assist tribal justice systems in administering justice fairly and with the utmost integrity, one of TJSs tasks is to perform tribal court assessments intended to assist in defining specific technical assistance and training needed by tribal courts. 25 U.S.C.  3612.

Tribal Court Assessments can assist TJS in focusing on the universal needs of tribal justice systems as well as the specific individualized needs of tribal courts. Thus, these assessments are intended to identify and provide areas of training and technical assistance in matters such as criminal prosecution, foster care issueincluding Title IV-E issues, Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) issues, juvenile issues, and guardianshiptribal probate issues, tort and liability issues which occur on Indian lands and are regulated by tribal codes. TJS has determined that the tribal court assessments will utilize the Trial Court Performance Standards (TCPS) model that defines optimal court performance and is viewed as a blueprint for improving the administration of justice by focusing on performance, self-assessment and self-improvement of the trial justice system. TJS also conducts regular in-service meetings that focus on creating a universally consistent document. 

In addition to providing guidance for TJS on appropriate training, these tribal court assessments provide a conceptual framework of performance areas, community perception, focus on tribal courts operational activities, codes, procedures, and budget limitations.  For tribes, the assessments may be used to formulate a baseline to measure improvement and performance. Moreover, the tribal court assessments are often a basis of one-time funding decisions made by TJS. The assessments are important in many BIA programmatic coordinated efforts. These reviews provide a detailed database of tribal courts that will include tribal codes, judicial decisions and court profiles.

1.	Albuquerque/Santa Fe Courts of Indian Offenses, which includes Santa Fe Indian School Property, Santa Fe Indian Health Property, and the Albuquerque Indian School Property (land held in trust for the 19 Pueblos of New Mexico);

2.	Skull Valley Band of Goshutes Indians;

3.	Te-Moak Band of Western Shoshone Indians;

4.	Winnemucca Indian Tribe;

5.	Ute Mountain Ute Tribe;

6.	Tribes located in Oklahoma that are listed below:

a.	Apache Tribe of Oklahoma, Caddo Nation, Comanche Nation (with the exception of the Comanche Childrens Court); Delaware Nation, Fort Sill Apache Tribe of Oklahoma, Kiowa Indian Tribe of Oklahoma, Otoe-Missouria Tribe of Indians, and Wichita and Affiliated Tribe of Indians,

7.	Tribes located in Oklahoma that are listed below:

a.	Eastern Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma;
b.	Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma;
c.	Ottawa Tribe of Oklahoma;
d.	Peoria Tribe of Oklahoma;
e.	Seneca-Cayuga Tribe of Oklahoma.
 
Tribal Court Assessments can assist TJS in focusing on the universal needs of tribal justice systems as well as the specific individualized needs of tribal courts. Thus, these assessments are intended to identify and provide areas of training and technical assistance in matters such as criminal prosecution, foster care issueincluding Title IV-E issues, Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) issues, juvenile issues, and guardianshiptribal probate issues, tort and liability issues which occur on Indian lands and are regulated by tribal codes. TJS has determined that the tribal court assessments will utilize the Trial Court Performance Standards (TCPS) model that defines optimal court performance and is viewed as a blueprint for improving the administration of justice by focusing on performance, self-assessment and self-improvement of the trial justice system. TJS also conducts regular in-service meetings that focus on creating a universally consistent document. 

In addition to providing guidance for TJS on appropriate training, these tribal court assessments provide a conceptual framework of performance areas, community perception, focus on tribal courts operational activities, codes, procedures, and budget limitations.  For tribes, the assessments may be used to formulate a baseline to measure improvement and performance. Moreover, the tribal court assessments are often a basis of one-time funding decisions made by TJS. The assessments are important in many BIA programmatic coordinated efforts. These reviews provide a detailed database of tribal courts that will include tribal codes, judicial decisions and court profiles.

<p>Factor I - Technical Approach <br />Offerors shall provide a clear and detailed approach to meeting the Government's objective and executing all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>Factor II - Past Performance<br />Provide narratives of up to two past projects of a similar scope to the Statement of Work.

<p>Factor III - Pricing <br />Offerors shall provide a firm fixed price (per student) to perform the requirements of the attached SOW for the base period and all option periods. The offeror's price will be evaluated to analyze and assess the accuracy and reasonableness of the proposed price and the realism of the proposed price to the Government's independent estimate.</p>
<p>EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS:</p>
<p>52.212-2: Evaluation - Commercial Items (Oct 2014)<br />The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered. This process permits tradeoffs among price and non-price factors and allows the Government to select for award the Offeror whose price is not necessarily the lowest, but whose technical and past performance is more advantageous to the Government and warrants the additional cost. <br />The Technical Capability Volume is considered more important than the Past Performance Volume. The Technical Capability and Past Performance Volume, when combined, are significantly more important than the Pricing Volume.</p>
<p>Factor I - Technical Approach</p>
<p>The offeror will be evaluated on its ability to:<br />1) Meet the Government's objectives<br />2) Demonstrate a clear understanding of the work to be performed <br />3) Perform the tasks of the SOW.</p>
<p>Factor II - Past Performance</p>
<p>The offeror will be evaluated on its ability to provide past projects of a similar scope to the Statement of Work. The offeror shall successfully demonstrate its ability to carry out a contract of this nature by including a description of the timeliness and quality of services provided; a brief description of how the project(s) relate to this project; and how the success of the prior project(s) was determined. The offeror shall include all relevant information regarding past projects, including contract number, value, description, and technical/contracting points of contact's (POC's) names, telephone numbers, agency and e-mail addresses.</p>
<p>Factor III - Pricing</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the proposed cost per student for the base and all option periods to determine price reasonableness and realism. The Government's total evaluated price for each offeror will include the cost per student (Not to Exceed number of Students) for the base and all option periods. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the options. Offers containing any charges for failure to exercise any option will be rejected.</p>
<p>Reasonableness: The Government will evaluate price and determine price reasonableness based on comparative, competitive pricing among the offerors and/or as compared to the Government's own Independent Cost Estimate. The reasonableness of proposed price and option periods shall also be assessed by the acceptability of the Offeror's methodology used in developing the price estimates. For the price to be reasonable, in its nature and amount, it should be commensurate with what would be incurred by a prudent person in the conduct of a competitive business. Only reasonable offers will be considered for award. Unreasonably high or low offers present a risk to the government in achieving a best-value solution and, therefore, will not be considered. <br />Realism: The government may also employ a price realism analysis to ensure that the offeror understands the requirements and is not proposing an excessively risky approach by proposing a potentially unrealistically low price. Determining price realism is highly subjective and may be based largely on the Government's knowledge and experience with the service being acquired.<br />A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />Applicable Provisions:</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Description of requirement for Coso Hot Springs Monitoring, Analysis and Report

Purpose, Overview and Background
 
The purpose of the Coso Hot Springs Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting project is to monitor changes associated with the Coso Hot Springs (CHS) and is required in a 1979 Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the U.S.
 Navy and Native American tribes. This project is part of an ongoing Coso Monitoring Program.

Overview
The purpose of yearly CHS Monitoring reports is to document changes in the physical and chemical parameters related to CHS Archeological District, and thereby gain insight into the geology and hydrology of the near-surface geothermal activity in the CHS area. Establishing an unambiguous and quantitative baseline allows comparison of conditions over a period of multiple years.
 
Background

The Coso Monitoring Program was initiated by the U.S. Navy Geothermal Program Office (GPO) in 1978 to gather baseline data on the surface and near-surface thermal activity at Devils Kitchen and Coso Hot Springs: the main active thermal features associated with the Coso geothermal area located within the Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS), at China Lake, California.
 The GPO, while located at China Lake, is a division of the Public Works Department of the Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center (EXWC), a naval command established in 2012 and located at the Naval Base Ventura County, in Port Hueneme, California. 

Performance Work Statement (PWS)

The Scope: Yearly reports: the Contractor shall prepare yearly reports based on the CHS Monitoring Program. These reports will summarize the analysis of the results determined from the data collection for monitoring of selected physical and chemical parameters from the CHS area. These reports must incorporate the data collected by the GPO and transmitted to the Contractor. Report(s) shall cover the reporting period(s) as outlined below: 

a.
 1st Report: includes data for January 2015  December 2015 (deliverable for CLIN 0001), the base year of the purchase order. 

b. 2nd Report: includes data for January 2016  December 2016 (deliverable for CLIN 0002), if Option Year 1 is exercised. 
 
c. 3rd Report: includes data for January 2017  December 2017 (deliverable for CLIN 0003), if Option Year 2 is exercised.

d. 4th Report: includes data for January 2018  December 2018 (deliverable for CLIN 0004), if Option Year 3 is exercised. 

e. 5th Report: includes data for January 2019  December 2019 (deliverable for CLIN 0005), if Option Year 4 is exercised.

NOTE: Project Schedule as Planned for the Base Year and Option Years (60 months, total)

Delivery dates for the reports above are indicated in Attachment A.
 The Government anticipates that all of the necessary data, consisting of six data sets annually, will be delivered to the Contractor within the first month after the end of the data collection year (calendar year). Although the project schedule does not commence until the beginning of calendar year 2016, the Government intent is to award the purchase order before the end of federal fiscal year 2015. Hence, the base year for the purchase order (CLIN 0001) would commence no later than 30 September 2015, for a 12-month period.

Option Period 1 (CLIN 0002), if exercised, would commence no later than the anniversary of the award of the purchase order, if the option is exercised. That same pattern for the option years following Option Year 1 would continue (if all options are exercised) with subsequent planned option years, not to exceed a 60-month maximum for the total term of the purchase order.
 

Place of delivery: The GPO is located at China Lake, California, at the Naval Air Weapons Station. The address is provided below. It is expected that all reports and any other information pertinent to the services rendered will be delivered electronically, by Email.

Location of inspection and acceptance: Deliverables for this procurement will be inspected and accepted at China Lake, California. 

For further information: see the complete Solicitation N39430R151720 available within this Combined Synopsis/Solicitation posting. Note that the Place of Performance will only be knowable when an award is executed. The Place of Performance remains unknown until a Successful Offeror is selected because all the work will be done at a contractor facility, not at a government facility.

(c) If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the order is terminated for the convenience of the Government, the Contracting Officer shall allow reasonable costs resulting from the stop-work order in arriving at the termination settlement. (d) If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the order is terminated for default, the Contracting Officer shall allow, by equitable adjustment or otherwise, reasonable costs resulting from the stop-work order. (e) The Government?s rights to terminate this contract at any time are not affected by action taken under this clause. (f) If, as the result of the Contractor?s intentional or negligent misstatement, misrepresentation, or miscertification, a protest related to this contract is sustained, and the Government pays costs, as provided in FAR 33.102(b)(2) or 33.104(h)(1), the Government may require the Contractor to reimburse the Government the amount of such costs.

Supporting documentation in Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) for invoices shall include summaries of work charged during the period covered as well as overall cumulative summaries by individual labor categories, rates, and hours (both straight time and overtime) invoiced; as well as, a cost breakdown of other direct costs (ODCs), materials, and travel, by TI, SLIN, or CLIN level.  For other than firm fixed price subcontractors, subcontractors are also required to provide labor categories, rates, and hours (both straight time and overtime) invoiced; as well as, a cost breakdown of ODCs, materials, and travel invoiced.  Supporting documentation may be encrypted before submission to the prime contractor for WAWF invoice submittal.  Subcontractors may email encryption code information directly to the Contracting Officer (CO) and Contracting Officer Representative (COR).  Should the subcontractor lack encryption capability, the subcontractor may also email detailed supporting cost information directly to the CO and COR; or other method as agreed to by the CO.
(b)  Contractors submitting payment requests and receiving reports to WAWF using either Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) or Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) shall separately send an email notification to the COR and CO on the same date they submit the invoice in WAWF.  No payments shall be due if the contractor does not provide the COR and CO email notification as required herein. <BR> <BR>

<p>X__52.246-2 -- Inspection of Supplies -- Fixed-Price. (Aug. 1996)<br />(a) Definition. "Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985). If a fixed-price incentive contract is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price.

When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation costs from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final price of this contract.<br />Alternate II (Jul 1985). If a fixed-ceiling-price contract with retroactive price redetermination is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause:<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, when redetermining the prices under the price redetermination clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the redetermined prices shall be at no increase in the redetermined price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the initial contract prices or, if established, the redetermined contract prices or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce the initial contract price or, if it is established, the redetermined contract prices.

<p>Personal Service Contract (PSC)<br />Statement of Work (SOW)<br />Justice Program Advisor<br />INL/AP Washington, D.C.<br />GS-13  (Equivalent)</p>
<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT <br />The Office of Afghanistan and Pakistan Affairs (INL/AP) is part of the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) in the Department of State.  The Bureau is responsible for the development, supervision, coordination, and implementation of international criminal justice assistance and international narcotics control assistance activities for the Department of State.  INL/AP provides policy guidance and develops, executes, and monitors programs to address the full range of criminal justice issues as they relate to stabilization and reconstruction activities in Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p>
<p>The Afghanistan Justice Team focuses on fostering a stable and strong justice system in Afghanistan through support for the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) and civil society.  To accomplish this goal, the Justice Team manages an array of INL-funded programs in justice sector development, legal training, major crimes, gender justice, legal education, and access to justice sectors.  These programs, overseen by INL, are implemented by international organizations, private contractors, and the Government of Afghanistan.  In addition, INL has been engaged in efforts with the Ministry of Justice, Attorney General's Office, Ministry of Women's Affairs, Supreme Court, Ministry of Interior, Afghan Independent Bar Association, and Afghan Prosecutors' Association, as well as cross-sector training led by the International Development Law Organization.  The INL Afghan Justice Team also collaborates with INL/AP-wide efforts in the corrections and counternarcotics sectors.</p>
<p>The Justice Program Advisor (hereafter "Advisor") will advise INL/AP in the management, coordination, and oversight of INL's Justice Sector Support Program (JSSP).  JSSP, a Department of State contract currently administered by Pacific Architects and Engineers (PAE), is INL/AP's primary foreign assistance mechanism to GIRoA on justice issues.<br />JSSP partners with the Ministry of Justice, Supreme Court, Attorney General's Office, Ministry of Interior, and the Ministry of Women's Affairs to help the GIRoA achieve effective and professional justice institutions.  JSSP helps these justice institutions develop institutional capacity, improves the legislative framework, and implements and expands system integration through a nationwide criminal case management system.</p>
<p>Specifically, JSSP advisors working within the Afghan justice ministries advise on topics that include budgeting, procurement, management, report writing, gender equities, ethics, and proposal drafting.  JSSP also works with legislative drafters to help reform Afghanistan's legal framework and ensure that laws are clearly drafted, constitutional, and the product of effective and consultative drafting processes.  The nationwide criminal Case Management System (CMS) implemented by JSSP contains more than 140,000 unique cases, assists in identifying cases that are over their statutory time limit, and helps ensure a transparent system of criminal processing and adjudication.<br />This initiative represents a critical component of INL's broader mission to bolster the formal justice sector in Afghanistan. The Advisor will manage this important program while also contributing, as requested, to INL's non-JSSP justice assistance activities.</p>

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment.

Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>

<DESC>This is an announcement by the U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) under Solicitation No. W15P7T-15-R-0011 that serves as a notice to industry concerning procurement of Non-Developmental Item (NDI) products to meet the requirements of the Small Airborne Link 16 Terminal (SALT) system for Army Aviation. SALT is intended as a two-channel software-defined, National Security Agency (NSA) Type 1 radio, consisting of Link 16 and Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW). The Government will not consider developmental products, as market research has verified that the SALT requirements can be met using only NDI or modified NDI products.   <br>    <br>  This announcement reflects the new solicitation number to be used for SALT, and it is an update to the announcement under Solicitation Number W15P7T-14-R-5002.  <br>    <br>  The release of the SALT Request for Proposal (RFP) was delayed due to the need to conduct further market research regarding this acquisition.  At the conclusion of market research a separate notice with revised draft RFP documents will be posted, which is anticipated to be provided in February of 2015. Subsequently, the formal RFP will be posted with response dates and instructions as applicable to this solicitation.  <br>    <br>  Please see the attached document which contains Government responses to industry questions received regarding draft RFP documents provided via FedBizOpps under solicitation no.

<DESC>Red River Army Depot (RRAD) in Texarkana, TX is seeking possible sources to provide the equipment listed below. Please respond if your firm is interested in providing this equipment.
<p>HEMTT A4 Cab Testing System</p>
<p>RRAD has the assigned mission to overhaul/various wheeled vehicles in the Army system. This includes the Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT). Associated with this work is the secondary work of assembling the HEMTT A4 cab and installing it on the vehicle.</p>
<p>The depot is interested in identifying contractors able to furnish HEMTT A4 Cab Testing Equipment for Quality Assurance and man hour reduction purposes prior to installing the cab on the vehicle.</p>
<p>The cab tester shall have the ability to test the following switches on the console inside the cab, the Beacon Lamp, High Idle, Engine Brake, Lo/Med/Hi, Gpfu, Dimmer, Ignition, Dome Lighting, Aux Hydraulic, Work Lamp, Engine Brake On/Off, Wiper Lo/Hi, Black-Out Select, Axle Lock, Start, Abs Disable, Hydraulic Enable, Chem Alarm, Washer, Master Lighting, Black-Out Lighting.</p>
<p>The HEMTT Cab Console Tester will verify proper electrical assembly of the HEMTT Cab Console-Under-Test. The Cab Console Tester should not require more than one (1) Operator to manually connect and disconnect cables to the HEMTT Cab as well as actuate switches, levers, pushbuttons, etc. on the Console itself. The HEMTT Cab Tester shall provide 24VDC to power the Cab. Where applicable, the Console's electrical functions will be automatically checked by the computer to decrease cycle time and eliminate the risk of an operator error. Automatic tests will be limited to functions that can be directly accessed through external devices such as load cells, accelerometers, etc. and/or the Cab's CAN BUS controller.</p>
<p>The Test Application Software should automatically prompt the Operator to perform and confirm pass/fail of any manually-driven tests. Tests must be predefined and the process must be automated so that results are reliable and consistent. The entire system should reside within a mobile computer enclosure. The depot prefers a solution that is turn-key and one that is a common and/or standard product for the supplier and wishes to avoid tailor-made solutions.</p>
<p>Respondent should have experience in the supply of Off-Highway cabs, and operator platforms control consoles.</p>

<AWDNBR>GS-00F-290CA
<AWDDATE>092915
<DONBR>HSCEMS-15-F-00078
<DESC>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple-Award Schedule Program, 41 U.S.C. 152(3), Competitive Procedures, and 40 U.S.C. 501, Services for Executive Agencies. This document sets forth the justification for award on a limited source basis as required by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.405-6 (C)(1)(i)(B).<br /><br />1. Agency and Contracting Activity
<p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Office of Acquisition Management (OAQ), proposes to order services from the Federal Supply Schedule on a basis of other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>2. Nature and/or Description of Action Being Approved</p>
<p>DHS ICE OFM requests a Logical Follow-on to task order # HSCEMS-14-F-00076 to maintain continuity of services for the agency's Data Management requirement. The contractor performed an analysis of the environment and prepared a Data Quality Assessment and Data Management Strategy. It is now required to execute the Data Management Strategy by building a complete data warehouse.</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs</p>
<p>A Data Model was established in the Development environment under aforementioned task order above. This model is currently populated only with the subset of data currently available in ICE's Federal Reporting Repository. In order to use the Data Model as a historical archive and as a foundation for financial reporting, the Data Model needs to be completed. The contractor will assist federal staff in further developing the data warehouse, devise a reporting strategy, and document the process. The estimated total value of the contract is $6.5M. The base Period of Performance is September 29, 2015 through September 28, 2016 and an option period of September 29, 2016 through March 31, 2017.</p>
<p>4. Identification of Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting limited sources competition for this action falls within FAR 8.405-6 (a)(1)(i)(C), which is used in situations where "In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order or BPA must not have been previously issued under sole-source or limited-sources procedures."</p>
<p>5. Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or the Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited</p>
<p>The contractor initiated work on the Data Management project by performing a Data Quality Assessment and a Data Management Strategy. The focus of the effort was to analyze the organizations' data (ICE and the DHS Component Customers), identify the gaps between the needs and current resources, and determine a plan forward. The primary subject of assessment was the existing data warehouse, "Financial Reporting Repository" (FRR), which aggregates data from disparate systems.</p>
<p>The findings are that the financial data currently stored in data warehouse FRR is incomplete, and will not effectively support a robust financial reporting foundation. In order to use the data warehouse, more data needs to be imported and cleansed.</p>
<p>The contractor's unique knowledge of the requirement, "mapping and gapping" the fields that will be required for the completed data model, is essential to expediting and launching a robust financial reporting foundation. The contractor has obtained access and configured their tools to execute the technical portions of the contract - these same tools will be required going forward on the project. It would be a detrimental setback to lose the experience and momentum on the project. In addition, for another contractor to begin work on the effort, the project would encounter unacceptable delays. The time and cost it would take for that contractor to acquire the knowledge and understanding of the ICE-specific technical processes far exceeds the cost to continue with the current contractor. To proceed with another contractor would cause a loss of the relevance of the work completed to date.<br /><br />6. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable</p>
<p>Pursuant to FAR Subpart 8.404(d), GSA has already determined the price of supplies and services under schedule contracts to be fair and reasonable. The contracting officer has reviewed proposed cost and determined that the follow-on task order represents the best value (as defined in FAR 2.101) and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government's needs.</p>
<p>7. A Description of the Market Research Conducted Among Schedule Holders and the Results or a Statement of the Reason Market Research was not Conducted</p>
<p>Market Research was conducted with the initial award so additional market research would not produce a different result for the follow-on task order requirements.</p>
<p>8. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition <br />None</p>
<p>9. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before any Subsequent Acquisition for Supplies or Services Required</p>
<p>To promote FSS ordering procedures in subsequent acquisitions the ICE will review schedule contractors' catalogs/price lists to locate potential vendors that can perform the services required.</p>

<DESC>This effort is to assess the current processes within DoD to determine if NAICS and PSC codes are being applied correctly and consistently across the DoD components and to determine the impact of NAICS and PSC code application. This study directly supports multiple initiatives within Better Buying Power 3.0, including promoting competition and increasing the use of small business through effective market research. The recommendations derived from this study could provide better definition to the application of NAICS and PSCs and could result in increasing opportunities for small business, enhancing market research abilities, and improving the validity of data comparisons within the DoD.
