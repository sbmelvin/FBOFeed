<DESC>The US Geological Survey intends to award a noncompetitive purchase order to Sonotronics of Tucson, AZ for Sonic tag equipment related to fish tagging (submersible ultrasonic receivers, manual tracking kits, mini sonic pingers, miniature sonic transmitters). This is the only known equipment proved to be effective in the Colorado River and capable of transmitting on all needed frequencies between 32-83 kHz. In addition, tracking equipment from this manufacturer is already in use on the project and equipment consistency is required for a long-term study. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302. Delivery will be to Flagstaff, AZ. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive offers, but interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the Contracting Officer by e-mail only (rdonez@usgs.gov) no later than the response date shown in this announcement.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of StoneGate Equipment and Maintenance. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government's requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/MSO/EML has identified the StoneGate product as a key component of the Department's core firewall infrastructure on OpenNet.  The equipment listed above is required to replace existing equipment that has reached the end of its life cycle.  The firewalls will continue to aid in the process of filtering out harmful web content and/or malicious code on the Department of State's mission critical operating environment. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department's requirements as a key component of the Department's core firewall infrastructure.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Systems Operations Contract Division, HQ, Washington, DC, is conducting a Market Survey/Request for Information to identify possible sources to provide multiple types of surge protective devices (SPD).  The purpose of the devices is to limit transient over voltages and divert surge currents appearing on FAA power distribution networks. The type of contract contemplated under this requirement is an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract consisting of a one year base period plus 4-one year options.  All prices are expected to be requested on a firm-fixed price (FFP) basis. This is solely a market survey to solicit statements of interest and capability to fulfill the Government's needs from all interested parties.  This point of interest is further expanded upon under the attached document entitled, "Surge Protective Device - Market Survey", dated December 2007. The response(s) to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only and will not be released.  Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked.  Vendor participation in any informational session is not a promise of future business with the FAA. The survey is not be construed as a screening information request (SIR), nor request for offer (RFO).  As such, the FAA will not accept unsolicited proposals and assumes no liability for any cost associated with the submission of responses to the market survey.  The FAA intends to review all response submittals to establish the acquisition strategy.  Responses to this market survey will be used to develop the Source List for this requirement and it will also be used to determine if there is adequate competition to set the requirement aside for Small Businesses, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, or the 8(a) Program in lieu of opening the acquisition up for full and open competition.  The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 335999; Surge Suppression Manufacturing.  The corresponding size standard in number of employees is 500. The announcement is located at: http://faaco.faa.gov/index.cfm. Response submittals must include the following: 1.  Documentation that clearly demonstrates that the interested vendor is qualified and capable of fulfilling the requirement.  (The format of the documentation is at the discretion of the vendor). 2.  Business size. 3.  Experience level and expertise in the functional area.   The FAA prefers that all response submittals, including attachments, be submitted electronically to the following e-mail address: Kenneth.M.Carter@faa.gov.  Responses should be submitted in a Microsoft Word (preferred); however, portable document format (i.e. .pdf file)is acceptable.  The FAA will not respond to telephonic inquiries. Note:  Any contract awarded for the requirements above will contain the AMS Clause 3.3.1-33 Central Contractor Registration (April 2006).  Award cannot be made to a vendor that has not accomplished this registration.

<CONTACT>AnneMarie Ternay, (609) 485-6990
<DESC>In accordance with Acquisition Management System Toolbox (AMS) T3.2.1.2, the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC) is conducting a market survey to assist in its development of an appropriate procurement strategy in fulfilling the Service Operations Support (SOS) requirements.  The SOS procurements will provide second-level engineering and field restoration services to the Terminal, EnRoute, and Technical Operations organizations. The following documents are attached to this announcement:   1. "Draft" statement of work (SOW) dated 12/20/07 2. "Draft" high-level listing of personnel required dated 12/20/07 3. "Draft" listing of systems that will be supported dated 12/20/07 4.  Business Declaration This is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or Request for Proposal (RFP).  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  A down-selection will not be conducted as a result of the market survey.  The FAA is seeking interested sources that are capable of providing the services described in the attached SOW. Currently, the WJHTC has two professional support service contracts that provide second-level engineering and field restoration services support.  The first was awarded as a competitive Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Business (SEDB) - 8(a), time and materials (T&M) procurement to Client Network Services, Incorporated (CNSI) under DTFA03-02-D-00011 (SOS-5) for legacy system support with a maximum ordering limitation of 2,883,013 hours (estimated value at $178.4M) for a base of one year with six 1-year option periods.  The other contract was a competitive Small Business Set-Aside, T&M procurement awarded to Apptis, Incorporated (previously known as Technology and Management Associates, Incorporated (TMA)) as DTFA03-02-D-00015 (SOS-6) for new system support with a maximum ordering limitation of 3,845,983 hours (estimated value at $248.4M) for a base of one year with six 1-year option periods. The WJHTC desires to provide an opportunity to compete at least a SEDB - 8(a) and a small business competition for the follow-on requirements under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541519 (Other Computer Related Services) with a size standard of $23M. Currently, the Government has not yet determined which systems (attachment no. 3) will be included in the SEDB - 8(a) or small business competition.  The Government contemplates an award of at least two T&M type or cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) type contracts to fulfill the requirements of the attached "draft" SOW.  The period of performance is anticipated for seven (7) years.  The commencement date is expected around March 2009.     At this time, interested sources are requested to provide the extent and depth of their PRIME experience (as either a prime or a subcontractor) in performing the same or similar maintenance support as described in the attached draft SOW.   No more than five (5) pages shall be submitted.  An elaborate proposal is not required.  The submission should be simple and provide straightforward, concise delineation of the respondent's prime experience in performing the same or similar work as described in the attached SOW. In addition to the 5-page technical capabilities submission, interested firms are also asked to submit the attached Business Declaration form (attachment no. 4) and a copy of their 8(a) certification (if applicable).  Also, submissions must also identify whether or not the contractor has been recently audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and whether or not the contractor has a DCAA approved Cost Accounting System.  If the vendor has not been audited and/or has an approved DCAA Cost Accounting System, please identify if you plan to attain either, and what is the timeline for receiving them. Failure of a sufficient number of adequately qualified firms that respond to this survey may result in a competitive procurement open to all businesses, so all qualified SEDB 8(a) and small businesses are highly encouraged to respond to this survey. Responses to this announcement are due by 2 p.m. (local time) on January 22, 2008, and shall be directed to the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center, Attn:  Anne Marie Ternay, AJP-7951, Atlantic City International Airport, NJ  08405.  An original and 3 copies, and one electronic copy on CD is required.  The electronic submission and the hard copies must be identical.  E-mail responses WILL NOT be accepted.  Any comments, concerns, or questions regarding this procurement are highly encouraged and may be directly submitted to Anne Marie Ternay.  These comments, concerns, or questions do not have a page limitation and are in addition to the 5-page technical capabilities statement submission.  The Government reserves its right to consider any, all, or none of the comments, concerns or questions received. All interested parties are advised the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred associated with any response to this Market Survey announcement.  Therefore, any costs associated with this Market Survey submission will be solely at the interested party's expense.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy, Idaho Operations Office (DOE-ID), intends to award a firm-fixed price, sole-source contract for a commercial item in accordance with FAR Part 13 and under the authority of FAR 13.106(b) with the small business vendor J. W. Bibler & Associates, 893 Honey Court, Arnold, CA, Zip Code 95223-3429l, for a focused workload, staffing, and effectiveness assessment of two of DOE-IDýýýs organizations.  The estimated cost of this acquisition is $22,000, inclusive of all travel.  The period of performance is to be from February 1, 2008 to April 15, 2008.  The NAICS is 541611. From 2004-2005, the DOE-ID underwent a significant change in its management and operations (M&O) contracting strategy and structure to fulfill the need of overseeing the DOE Nuclear Energyýýýs Idaho National Laboratory and the Idaho Completion Project.  This dramatic change necessitated a need to re-train DOE-ID federal employees towards a better understanding of both the revamped contracts and the federal role in administering the new contracts. Bibler worked with DOE-ID management and staff to: develop a contract management seminar series (CMSS) that would enable participants to understand the contracting environment; become familiar with the newly issued M&O contracts; understand the relationship between contractors and federal oversight personnel; and, become knowledgeable of the functions, duties, and limitations on the authority of oversight personnel at DOE-ID and DOE Headquarters. Bibler & Associates performed two subsequent assessments to determine the extent to which DOE-ID employees have retained and are using the knowledge skills, and information obtained from the CMSS. In developing this training and subsequent assessments, Bibler & Associates obtained significant knowledge of: the DOE-ID; the Idaho National Laboratory and Idaho Completion Project contracts; the DOE Headquarters organization; and the interactions necessary to accomplish the DOE-ID mission. Under this award, the contractor will perform a focused workload, staffing, and effectiveness assessment of two of DOE-IDýýýs organizations.  This efficiency assessment will address the current workload being performed in the two organizations as well as the specific work activities that account for the most significant effort.  Interviews will be conducted with various employees. It is anticipated that a minimum of three trips will be necessary to interview employees, review work documents, and analyze work performance against the established Process Descriptions and Work Instructions in their areas.  An additional topic for the assessment will be the membersýýý views of the relative importance of functions and activities they perform and their thoughts on obstacles and issues that could be removed or mitigated to improve their effectiveness.  Once completed, a Final Report will be prepared for DOE-IDýýýs Manager, along with two additional reports for each of the Assistant Managers of the organizations reviewed.  It is anticipated that three visits to the Idaho Falls area will be required, one initial visit to establish critical issues, and two follow-on visits to perform the remainder of the work. It is critical for the individual performing this assessment to have intimate knowledge of: the DOE-ID organization; DOE-IDýýýs work processes; DOE-ID and DOE Office of Nuclear Energy relationships and authorities; and, demonstrated expertise in organizational change and leadership and management disciplines. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES.  However, any firm that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification prior to the response due date.  Responses are required to be submitted before January 7, 5:00 p.m. EST. Responses shall be submitted via e-mail to surrusjk@id.doe and supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to perform the requirements listed. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion for the Government.   If no responses are received by the due date, the Government will proceed with the award to J.W. Bibler & Associates. Telephone requests or inquires will not be accepted.

<SUBJECT>99 -- GUARDIAN ANGEL ADVANCED PARACHUTE SYSTEM (GAAPS)
<SOLNBR>FA8629-07-R-2354
<ARCHDATE>04302008
<CONTACT>Nancy Leggett, Contracting Officer, Phone (937) 255-1696, Fax (937) 255-8351, Email Nancy.Leggett@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC>The 670 Aeronautical Systems Squadron (670 AESS), Battlefield Airmen program office, seeks to acquire and field a Guardian Angel Advanced Parachute System (GAAPS) that provides the best overall value to meet the pararescueman's need for a single standardized harness for the parachute systems for Freefall, Static line, and Tandem configurations.  This single system will share the same external configuration, provide a greater weight capacity, reduce opening shock, and have multiple uses and deployment capabilities.   The objective for this procurement is for the delivery of specification compliant systems IAW the contract delivery schedule, delivery of the required data items and products, and execution of the associated program support.  

670 AESS plans to issue formal RFP Number FA8629-08-R-2354 for the GAAPS system on or about 15 February 2008, with proposals due on or about 15 March 2008.  The Government anticipates the requirement for GAAPS will be approximately 1430 state of the art parachutes to replace the legacy parachutes currently fielded.  Options for further production, training and sustainment will also be placed on the initial contract for execution after additional production funds become available.  Thirty (30) freefall and thirty (30) static line systems are required for the initial procurement in FY08.  However, the contract is being structured on an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity basis, so that other interested customers can also use this vehicle to purchase the system.  

Utilizing the Best Value approach, the government will consider innovative or individualized solutions to meeting the system and program requirements.  However, the contractor is encouraged to provide representative systems as rapidly as possible.  It is anticipated that the contractor will provide the fastest practical schedule and an alternate schedule which would accommodate additional customers.  

The proposed system shall consist of the following basic components for each configuration: 

Standardized harness and container
Canopies (main and reserve) 
Parachute deployment system for each type of system

The Government contemplates a contract that shall provide for an initial delivery order to include any initial integration efforts that need to be accomplished to meet the required baseline.  

The configuration shall consist of the following: 
GAAPS systems (described above)
Contractor and Government Technical Testing
Logistics Support (spares; training (including the systems to be used during training); technical manuals; and contractor logistics support)  

Draft technical requirements will be posted on line at FedBizOpps at http://www.fbo.gov for review and comment as soon as possible.  A copy of the formal RFP Number FA8629-08-R-2354 may be accessed via the internet on or about 15 February 2008 on FedBizOpps at http://www.fbo.gov .  All questions and comments must be submitted electronically to Ms. Nancy Leggett, Battlefield Airmen Contracting Officer at Nancy.Leggett@wpafb.af.mil.  Current POC is Ms. Nancy Leggett at phone 937-255-1696.   

Interested parties and offerors should obtain, read and review the complete information package to determine all technical requirements prior to submission of any offers.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Government.

A Request for Information (RFI) was sent out for this effort under the title "Guardian Angel Advanced Parachute System", dated 17 October 2007.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command has a requirement for the accomplishment of evaluations addressing the capability of a CG(X) design leveraging DDG 1000 Class technologies.  These evaluations, which will include the submission of studies performed independently, will be accomplished by performing analysis on ship design attributes and conducting naval architecture analysis relating to the current DDG 1000 Class design.  The requirement under this solicitation will be issued to one of the two sources qualified to provide an evaluation, Northrop Grumman Ship Systems, 1000 Access Road, Pascagoula, MS 39568.  A solicitation is being issued for a separate evaluation to Bath Iron Works,  700 Washington Street, Bath, ME 04530-2574.  It is planned that these two evaluations will be separately procured, without full and open competition, from the only two qualified DDG 1000 shipbuilders who have the requisite knowledge of the DDG 1000 design to adequately perform the required eval!  uations.  It is anticipated that both efforts will be performed over a six month period.  Please see note 22.

The Government anticipates a modification to contract N00164-06-C-6951 with Exide Technologies to provide logistical support to a Government provided contractor completing plastic welds on previously manufactured VRLA cells.  The cells are at the Exide storage and manufacturing facilities in Fort Smith Arkansas.

This modification is being issued using the authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source will satisfy agency requirements.

A determination by the Government not to compete based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 33911   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to BGI Incorporated, 58 Guinan Street, Waltham, MA 02451 for the acquisition of eight (8) BGI saturation samplers and accessories. The design of BGI's saturation sampler meets two important performance criteria which are not available from other manufacturers. (1) The size-selective performance of the BGI unit has been fully characterized in the laboratory and is the only model available whose inlet performance has been documented  in peer-reviewed literature (L. Kenny, et.al. "Aspiration and Sampling Efficiencies of the TSP and Louvered Particulate Matter Inlets", J. Environ. Monitoring, 2005, 487.) (2) BGI's saturation sampler includes use of shape-cut cyclone for accurate fractionation of PM2.5 aerosols and does not rely  on impactors whose loading performance is known to significantly degrade within a few hours of fields use (L. Kenny, et al. "Investigation on the Effects of Loading on PM2.5 Separators", Health and Safety Laboratory, Sheffield, England, 1998).

<DESC>Notice of intent to issue a purchase order.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, (NIOSH), Cincinnati, Ohio, intends to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to Brigham and Women?s Hospital for Occupational Exposures in the Nurses Health Study (NHS). The NHS-III pilot study will include 3 selected states that are able to provide a computer file with names and mailing addresses for all licensed nurses in that state, as well as either their date of birth or the date of issue of their original nursing license; this information is necessary to target nurses in the correct age range.  To improve minority participation, states that have a high proportion of minorities will be included, if possible, and Licensed Practial / Vocational Nurses (LPNs) as well as Registered Nurses (RNs) will be included; LPNs have a much higher proportion of minorities than RNs.  The states that meet these criteria and are being considered for selection in the full study include Florida, Texas, North Carolina, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Georgia, Virginia, Tennessee, South Carolina, Maryland, Alabama, and Missouri. Three of these states, Illinois, Florida, and North Carolina, have already been selected for the pilot study.  Participants must have access to a computer with an Internet connection to complete the web-based questionnaire.  However, the pilot study will assess whether participation would be maximized by offering a mailed questionnaire.
Sub-Task A.   To develop occupational question modules for the baseline and pregnancy questionnaires.  
The purpose of this sub-task is to create occupational exposure modules for the baseline and pregnancy questionnaires (Specific Aim 1).  Occupational exposures and activities on the baseline and pregnancy questionnaires shall include work schedule, night work, and average hours worked per week over the previous year.  There shall also be two lifetime shift work questions.  Data shall also be collected on physical factors, such as lifting at work and hours spent standing or walking at work, on average, over the previous year.  Separate exposure modules shall be developed to collect information on lifetime occupational chemical exposures to anti-viral and antineoplastic medication administration, high-level disinfectants, and anesthetic gases.  The occupational exposure modules shall also collect information on exposure controls, such as ventilation and use of personal protective equipment.  Each exposure module shall begin with a ?gateway? question about lifetime exposure that will be programmed to skip to the next module if the participant has never worked with the substance in question, thus reducing participant burden.  The web-based interview shall be tested to ensure that skip patterns and gateway questions are properly programmed.  
Sub-Task B: To collect data in a pilot study.  
This sub-task will involve recruitment and data collection of a pilot phase of the NHS-III.  An introductory letter, which has previously been approved by NIOSH, from the Principal Investigator explaining the study?s purpose and procedures shall be prepared and mailed by the contractor to subjects in the pilot study.  A sample of approximately 6,000 nurses (3,000 RNs, 3,000 LPNs) shall be included in the mailing for the pilot phase.  The mailings shall include a return postcard to assess whether non-participants would be willing to participate if given the option of a mailed questionnaire.  In addition, a ?warning? postcard shall be mailed to all potential participants indicating that a letter will be arriving in a week.  At the same time, half of those who are mailed an invitation shall receive a ?warning? phone message also indicating that the letter is being sent.  
Sub-task C: To evaluate the pilot study.
Before conducting the full cohort study and to make improvements to the study design, questionnaires, or recruitment strategies, the contractor shall evaluate the pilot phase (Specific Aim 2).  We conservatively estimate that 10% of those invited to participate will respond, based on the response rate to the NHS-II, factoring in the web-based nature of the study.  If the actual response rate is less than 10%, NIOSH will collaborate with the contractor to evaluate whether the full study is feasible. The amount of time spent on the questionnaires and ease of use of the web-based questionnaire will be evaluated based on participant feedback, which will be collected on the questionnaire.  The contractor shall provide summary statistics to NIOSH of key variables from the baseline and pregnancy questionnaires, including occupational variables, demographic variables, and other health outcomes.  The summaries shall include frequency statistics for categorical variables and means and range of continuous variables, as well as the percent missing data.  The accuracy and completeness of data and feasibility of data analysis shall also be evaluated by the contractor, with input from NIOSH investigators.  The contractor shall evaluate whether mailed questionnaires would improve participation, and by how much and shall also evaluate the effectiveness of the ?warning? phone message.  If we determine that the study is not feasible, we will consider other options, such as a second pilot study using a combination of web and paper questionnaires.
Contract staff should include an epidemiologist, a computer programmer, and a web-programmer.  The epidemiologist should have experience in reproductive epidemiology, epidemiology methods, and statistical analysis, and should have familiarity with the methods of the Nurses? Health Studies.  The computer programmer should have experience with the Nurses? Health Studies data and be familiar with using SAS.  The web-programmer associated with the NHS-III is necessary to the contract to facilitate programming the occupational modules.
The contractor shall submit monthly progress reports.  These reports shall include information on enrollment, demographic information on participants, and progress of data analyses, when applicable. In addition, the contractor shall communicate regularly (via bi-weekly conference calls) with the NIOSH technical monitor to resolve problems and discuss progress.

UTE COAL FIRED POWER PLANT PROJECT
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for a 300MW to 400MW coal-fired power plant for Uruguay's National Administration for Electric Supply and Transmission (Administracion Nacional de Usinas y Transmisiones Electricas, UTE) 

UTE is interested in the development of an estimated $560 million 300MW to 400MW coal-fired power plant as a cost-effective method to meeting energy needs during periods of drought.  According to UTE, there are no longer potential sites to build additional hydroelectric plants, or to add reservoirs to existing hydroelectric plants that would allow UTE to expand domestic production.

The proposed coal fired power plant will become the first thermal unit to be dispatched, thus lowering the marginal costs of electricity in the system.  UTE lacks the technical expertise that is needed to thoroughly analyze the feasibility of this alternative and is looking for U.S. expertise in clean coal technologies.  The proposed feasibility study will provide UTE with the necessary implementation plan and requisite technical expertise needed to properly evaluate the development of a project of this magnitude.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $419,729 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: <b><a href=https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp>https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</a></b>  Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 1:00pm (local time), January 16, 2008 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SOLNBR>6219
<RESPDATE>122707
<CONTACT>Kenneth Carter, (202) 267-3012
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration, Systems Operations Contract Division, HQ, Washington, DC, contemplates the procurement of a contractor maintenance program in support of the Remote Maintenance Monitoring Systems (RMMS), at various locations throughout the United States, and its territories, to include Puerto Rico and Guam.  This system allows performance monitoring, control, and certification to be accomplished from numerous centralized work centers. The type of contract contemplated under this requirement is Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract consisting of a 1 year base period plus 4-one year option periods.  All prices are expected to be requested on a firm-fixed price (FFP) monthly basis.   The contract will encompass site and depot levels of maintenance, supply support for spares and repair parts.  The contractor will be responsible for furnishing all labor, supervision, tools, equipment, materials, replacement parts, and services to provide project management, configuration management, preventive maintenance, corrective and logistical maintenance and second level support, to include 24/7 National Trouble Help Desk/Hotline services.     All service technicians must be fully trained and certified on the RMMS System Components with a minimum of 5 years maintenance experience on these systems.  System components include, but are not limited to: servers, processors, work stations, tape backup systems, printers, network systems, etc.   A draft copy of the proposed statement of work (SOW) has been included with this announcement for informational purposes only.  As a draft, interested vendors are advised that the final SOW is subject to changes.      This is a market survey to solicit statements of interest and capability to fulfill the Government's needs from all interested parties in regards to this requirement.  The survey will be utilized for informational and planning purposes only.   The FAA intends to review all response submittals to establish the acquisition strategy under this requirement.  Responses may also be used to develop the Source List to be used when the solicitation for this requirement is issued and to determine if there is adequate competition to set the requirement aside for Small Businesses (SB), Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDB), or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses; or to open it up for full and open competition.  The information identified from this market survey may result in a restricted Screening Process when the RFP is issued.  This survey is being conducted in accordance with FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.2.1.  The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 811212; Computer and Office Machine Repair and Maintenance.  The corresponding size standards in millions of dollars under the NAICS code is $23 million. In order to make this determination, the FAA requires the following information from vendors: 1.	Statement whether the Government's needs can be met (per attached draft SOW, to include any attachment thereto).  In addition, see items 4 thru 7 below. 2.	Size and status of potential sources  3.	Customary practices, including warranties 4.	Statement whether the contractor has maintained the Tandem K-2000 computer system and all components down to the LRU level. 5.	Statement certifying that the contractor has a sufficient number of qualified technical personnel geographically or the capability to obtain such personnel, to disperse to service and repair all FAA MPS systems. 6.	Statement addressing parts depot for repair and replacement of K-2000 computers specified in the SOW. 7.	Statement addressing Government's desired restoration and response time for all levels of maintenance. The survey is not to be construed as a screening information request (SIR), nor request for offer (RFO).  As such, the FAA will not accept unsolicited proposals and assumes no liability for any cost associated with the submission of responses to the market survey. This announcement and the draft SOW are located at: http://faaco.faa.gov/index.cfm. Respondents are encouraged to review the statement of work and provide questions or comments in writing to Kenneth.M.Carter@faa.gov by 1:00 p.m. EDST, 5 December 2007.  The Contracting Officer will not respond to telephonic inquiries.

<RESPDATE>012008
<CONTACT>Larry Greer, (202) 493-4810
<DESC>This is a reissue of the Survey announcement to reestablish the instructions for Industry to submit the requested information.  No changes have been made in this announcement other than the updated Attachment "A" that remains available.                          ----------------- The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is releasing its third and final RFI to industry before releasing a Screening Information Request - Request for Proposal, estimated for issue late 2009.  This RFI is requesting industry to confirm the data it has already provided in the two previous requests (10/08/2004 & 07/19/ 2006) and to expand on expressed concepts of future voice switching in the NAS as well NextGen transitions.  In the first RFI (10/08/2004), the FAA was looking to see how industry viewed available voice switching technologies and to gage where industry saw technology heading.   In the second RFI released (07/19/ 2006), NVS was to further learn how industry saw solutions to the NVS mission and requirements and to further refine the NVS proposed Alternatives.  This third RFI is to further verify the revised alternatives, ascertain industry's vision for the future, and to again assess the viability and direction of voice switching technologies to meet the draft NVS requirements.  With this third NVS RFI the FAA is requesting the Voice Switching Industry's assistance in identifying current and potential capabilities available on the market.  The FAA is now performing an Investment Analyses to study which of three potential voice switching alternatives might best meet the FAA's present and future voice communications requirements.  The FAA has refined and updated the three, 07/19/2006 NVS alternatives, as rewritten in Attachment A.  In addition, a copy of the FAA's "initial Program Requirements for NVS" document is provided as Attachment B.  The FAA requests Industry address the three Alternatives using general interrogatories outlined in the Inquiry Template, Exhibit #1.  Responses may be submitted by E-mail.  If the response is sent electronically, it must be on company letterhead, in Microsoft Word, PDF and/or similarly formatted E-mail attachments.  The print package should be on 8 ýý x 11 size paper, using 12 point font.  Interested parties should reply to Larry.Greer@faa.gov, via E-mail, by close of business 5:00PM, January 22, 2008.   Packages not suitable for E-mail may be mailed or otherwise delivered to:   Larry R. Greer, AJA-47 Federal Aviation Administration  800 Independence Ave., SW Washington, DC  20590   Responses containing marketing materials aside from the white page response may be accepted.  None of the documentation submitted to the FAA will be returned.  At the Government's option, clarifications may be requested from one, some, all, or none of the respondents to the Market Survey.  No evaluation of vendors will take place as a result of this RFI.  Vendor participation in any manner or form is not a promise for future FAA business.  The information obtained through this RFI will be used to support development of an acquisition strategy for National Air Space Voice Switch research and development. Interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred as a result of your response to this Market Survey announcement.  Any and all costs associated with your NVS Market Survey submission will be solely at the expense of the submitting Vendor.    The Market Survey - Request for Information 6279 is amended as follows:

<SOLNBR>F08SOL00003
<RESPDATE>010708
<ARCHDATE>01222008
<CONTACT>Thomas Dempsey, Attorney Advisor, Phone 202/633-7259, Fax 202/633-7305, Email dempseyt@si.edu
<DESC>This original action published in the Federal Business Opportunity on November 1, 2007, is hereby amended to include the following responses to questions received:

1.	Will the responses submitted as part of the RFQ process be proprietary?  

Answer:  The Responses submitted as part of the RFQ process will be kept confidential and will not be shared with those not a part of the decision making process. The Smithsonian Institution (SI) will treat information contained in the responses as proprietary in keeping with applicable law. 


2.	Can Smithsonian issue a Request for Proposal based on responses submitted in response to the RFQ process?

Answer:  SI may issue a Request for Proposal as outlined in the RFQ; however, that decision has not yet been made.  Please note the answer to Question One above. See also paragraph three, under ?Introduction? on page 2 of the RFQ.

 
3.	Will Smithsonian make available the sign-in sheets from the scheduled tours of the Arts and Industries Building?  

Answer:  The sign in sheets will not be made available at this time.

 
4.	Can Smithsonian clarify its policy with regard to corporate sponsorship, particularly as it relates to potential naming rights of buildings, programs, and exhibits?

Answer:  Other than the language which is contained in the RFQ, SI cannot provide further clarification at this time:
?Any exterior signage will be subject to approval. The name etched on the outside of the building - National Museum - and the current name of the building ? Arts and Industries ? must be maintained. The building cannot be renamed for an individual, family, group, firm or corporation, although naming opportunities for interior spaces may be possible.? 

5.	The RFQ states that the costs for the required renovations are up to $65,000,000; however, the Washington Post December 13th edition stated that required capital repairs were $200,000,000.  Could you please clarify the difference in cost estimates?

Answer:  SI bases its calculation on a recent independent cost estimate which, as indicated in the RFQ, is for ?the work necessary to make the building structurally and environmentally sound and to provide a ?conditioned shell? ready for interior fitout.?  The figure quoted in the RFQ represents the estimated cost of the work outlined in the RFQ to update the building (please refer to Paragraph III. 4. on page 5 of the RFQ for more detail). Additional costs for outfitting the space will be dependent upon the individual proposals.

 	
6.	Can Smithsonian participate in any cash flow in excess of debt service or amortized costs necessary to renovate the Arts and Industries Building?  If so, does this cash flow participation have to be earmarked for other Smithsonian programs or facilities costs? 

Answer:  SI can participate in ?cash flow? as described; however, it has not been determined if and to what extent it would participate.  Therefore SI would be willing to consider proposals that address this type of structure.   At this time, SI does not have any intent to participate in funding the redevelopment or subsidizing negative operating costs.  
SI cannot address whether ?cash flow? participation would be earmarked for other Smithsonian program or facilities costs.


7.	Is there a requirement that the windows on the building be transparent? As a museum designer would need to control the light in an interior exhibition space, could opaque glass or other materials be used on the exterior windows of the four major quadrants of the building?

Answer:	All determinations regarding specific alterations to the property will be assessed once a development plan has been advanced.  Specific prohibitions regarding the work proposed have not been determined, and thus SI cannot comment on whether such work would be acceptable or unacceptable.  Prospective respondents are referred to the RFQ for explanation of the review process.  All alterations will be subject to approvals and should be consistent with the historical nature of the building and environment.

8.	Would it be OK to open only two entrances to the general public, one on the Mall (north) side and one on the Independence Avenue (south) side? That's the model used for most of the other museums on the National Mall. Then the East entrance would be available for deliveries and the West could be used as an emergency exit.

Answer:    See answer to Question Number 7 Above.

9.	Would it be permissible to use the West Hall as a restaurant space and the East Hall for a computer-based learning center or do you require that those halls be without any impediments?

Answer:	See answer to Question Number 7 Above.

10.	For museum purposes, would it be possible to just enclose the four large quadrants for humidity and other environmental controls without retrofitting the entire building, including the rotunda and four halls?

Answer:	The interconnection of halls, courts and ranges is an important feature of the interior of the building.  Any proposed modification would have to respect the open visual character.  See also answer to Question Number 7 Above.

11.	How many square feet are there on each of the two floors in each of the four quadrants that could be used as museum exhibition space?

Answer:	The answer is entirely dependent on the uses and configuration proposed by the respondent, including the construction or removal of building elements.  A graphic scale is shown on the floor plans provided with the RFQ and may be used as a guide in determining approximate building areas. 

12.	Is it still possible -- using the building program proposed by the National Museum for African American History and Culture
in the report from its Presidential Study Commission -- to create three levels of underground space towards the north and east of the A&I footprint?

Answer:	The construction of underground space adjacent to the building would entail substantial additional costs and technical challenges.  Its feasibility would also be controlled by the vigorous reviews of several entities.  SI cannot comment further on the ability to construct this space nor can SI comment on the suitability of such a plan. 

13. How many square feet could be developed underground to complement the space in the A&I Building?

Answer:	See Answer to Question Number 12 above.


14. Can elevators and escalators be installed inside of each quadrant?

Answer:	See Answer to Question Number 7 above

15. Could the four stairways in the rotunda be converted to escalators leading to the balconies of each quadrant?

Answer:	The four stairs are important character-defining features of the rotunda. It is unlikely that they could be changed. Each design would have to be reviewed for its impact on the historic character. See also Answer to Question Number 7 above.


16. If there is the prospect that a Presidential Commission could be studying, among other things, the site and governance of a major new national museum that would include exploring use of the A&I Building and considering whether or not the museum would be part of the Smithsonian, could a final decision on the disposition of the A&I Building await the report of that Commission? Would you allow a reasonable amount of time for this? 

Answer:	SI is unable to address a question of such speculative nature.  The exploration of a partnership to revitalize the Arts and Industries Building and the language of the RFQ were reviewed and approved by Congress. 


17. While the RE would have to maintain the integrity of the building design and exterior brickwork, is it possible to change the color of the paint on the exterior window frames and other exterior paint detailing provided that there is approval obtained from the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission on Fine Arts?

Answer:	See Answer to Question Number 7 above.


18. With respect to signage, the words "National Museum" etched in stone would work perfectly for a national museum at this location. But why must the current name of the building be maintained? A plaque somewhere discussing the history of the building and its names would be great. But if the museum that it houses is called the National Museum of the American People, it would make little sense to maintain the Arts and Industries nomenclature. Who is responsible for requiring the Arts and Industries name on the building in its new incarnation? I would call for reconsideration of that requirement. The name would be confusing as the building in my proposal would have nothing to do with the arts or industry.

Answer:	The RFQ explicitly states that the name on the building shall not be changed.  This decision has been made in this regard and, until further notice, shall not be changed.  Decisions with regard to other signage, as well as all other changes, are subject to consideration once a development plan has been advanced.  Prospective respondents are referred to the RFQ for explanation of the review process.

19. Is there a time frame in mind that the Smithsonian has for developing the A&I Building?

Answer:	The RFQ requires that respondents propose a schedule for redevelopment and occupancy:
?The RFQ proposal will be carefully evaluated against the following factors:
. . .
Demonstrating a well defined track record of successful operations, financial stability and the financial capability to proceed with full development within 24 months of execution of an agreement with the Smithsonian.?

20. Are there questions and answers from others that you will be sharing with those who have expressed an interest in the RFQ?

Answer:	Yes.

<SUBJECT>14 -- Request for Information (RFI) from Industry for a Launcher Test Stand
<SOLNBR>N00030-08-I-0201
<RESPDATE>013108

<CONTACT>Sheila Roche, Contracting Officer, Phone 703-601-9450, Fax 703-601-9473, Email Sheila.Roche@ssp.navy.mil - Virginia Hennings, Contracting Officer, Phone 703-601-9447, Fax 703-601-9473, Email Virginia.Hennings@ssp.navy.mil
<DESC>1. DESCRIPTION

1.1 PURPOSE

SSP is assessing the feasibility of developing a launcher test stand to support missile integration and underwater launch (test shapes potentially leading to actual submerged launch of missiles and other payloads).  SSP requires input from industry resources to refine their understanding of the technical feasibility, risk and cost implications associated with this effort.  Specifically, this RFI documents a Government request from industry for the plan/approach and rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost information associated with launcher test stand development and production in the three phase approach discussed below. 

 
1.2 BACKGROUND

The test facilities used by SSP are no longer available.  SSP has been developing underwater launch systems for over 50 years to support submarine launched missiles.  SSP needs to conduct risk identification/reduction and integration testing of new payloads prior to onboard testing and final integration on a submarine.  An adequate test stand will replicate the missile tube interface and submarine support system interfaces in order to conduct demonstration and integration testing.  Although near term demonstrations will be based on the 87 inch diameter missile tube, smaller missiles than the D5 missile are likely to be demonstrated.  Additionally, concepts for future submarines may have missile tubes larger than 87 inches in diameter.  Therefore, in order to determine potential ?knees in the curve? from a cost and capability standpoint, missile tube diameters between 87 inches and 120 inches, and 87 inches and 32 inches are considered separately.  These ranges are only provided for the purpose of identifying the determining factors associated with these two ranges and to bound configurations to be considered.  To ensure that the test stand will be usable for all scenarios into the foreseeable future, the test stand should be flexible enough to accommodate a minimum missile tube diameter of 32 inches and maximum of 120 inches.

2. DISCUSSION

2.1 CAPABILITIES

SSP is seeking information for a launcher test capability for development testing of underwater missile launch systems.  This capability consists of three separate phases.  The first phase will support land based testing of missile launch systems.  The second phase capability will support submerged static launch of missiles and other payloads within the twelve mile contiguous zone of U.S. territorial waters.  The third phase capability will support submerged launch of missiles and other payloads in a relevant operational submarine environment within the twelve mile contiguous zone of U.S. territorial waters.  This relevant operational submarine environment will consist of varying launch depths and dynamic water flow conditions during missile launch induced by submarine forward way and sea state (i.e. crossflow).  The first phase capability shall:

1. Support land-based testing of launcher concepts as part of missile testing.
2. Replicate SSGN Missile Tube (nominal) internal interfaces (SSGN missile tube is right-cylindrical tube approximately 87 inches in diameter and 44 feet long)

a. Be reconfigurable to support larger diameter missile tubes up to 120 inches in diameter, ?-1 inch thick and approximately 44 feet long.
b. Be reconfigurable to support smaller diameter missile tubes as small as 32 inches in diameter, ??- 1 inch thick and approximately 44 feet long)
c. Contain and replicate functions/shape of missile tube muzzle hatch.
d. Replicate the space envelope in the missile tube.

3. Be transportable while remaining non-mobile to operate in different test locations. 
4. Comply with Government environmental and safety standards.
5. Accommodate ejection of missile and other payload weights up to 200,000 pounds.

The second phase shall add the capability to:

6. Support static, submerged test launches of missiles and other payloads within the twelve mile contiguous zone of U.S. territorial waters.
The third phase shall add the capability to:
7. Support submerged launch of missiles and other payloads in a relevant operational submarine environment within the twelve mile contiguous zone of U.S. territorial waters.

2.2 INTERFACE DEFINITION

Below is a listing of interface and performance considerations.  The following information is provided to support this concept development.  Government Furnished Information (GFI) will be provided by SSP as requested. 

1. Mechanical Interfaces (e.g. Physical interfaces, Pressurization & Venting system, Hydraulic system, Heating & Cooling system, Dehumidification & Drying system)
2. Electrical Interfaces (e.g. Umbilical for Data/Power)
3. Data Recording & Interface Data Connectivity
4. Environmental (test/handling shock, payload release shock (recoil), vibration, sea water immersion, sea water pressure, launch debris)
5. Wharfside operations & Initial Missile Onload (e.g. Cranes, Maintenance Platforms, Hoists)
6. Dry Stowage (e.g. mothballed)
7. Missile Launch (e.g. Eject velocity, Missile loads, Cavitation loads)
8. Wet Stowage
9. Missile off-load

2.3 INFORMATION REQUESTED

Provide conceptual technical information, comments and ROM cost assessments (where applicable) for the following items:

1. Test Stand Concept - Provide a Level 1(Overall System) physical architecture, approach and cost ROM for a test stand that meets the aforementioned capabilities (section 2.1-1 thru 5) and subsequent modifications to meet phase II capabilities (6) and phase III additional capabilities (7). Also provide architecture and ROM cost to allow the replacement of the nominal 87 inch diameter missile tube with up to 120 inch diameter missile tube or down to 32 inch diameter missile tube.  Discuss any issues related to providing this flexibility.
2. Design Impacts-

a. Comment on design considerations to modify the concept(s) from phases I and II to provide the desired phase III capability?
b. Comment on how the incorporation of the desired phase III capability would impact the phase I and phase II design concept(s).
3. Concept of Operations (CONOPS) ? Provide a CONOPS which clearly defines the associated test and tactical demonstration scenarios to be employed for each phase.  Include the anticipated test stand motion induced from payload release. Also, comment on how launch preparation, maintenance and downtime will be minimized, and how the design will minimize acquisition and operating costs. 
4. Test Facility Integration - Identify and describe any facility support/foundation requirements and or equipment for each phase.  Comment on any desired sea bed modifications (i.e. surface hardness) to support the test platform.
5. Multiple Locations - The test stand may be redeployed to other locations to meet test requirements.  These test locations could be land based CONUS, such as Crane, Indiana or Aberdeen, MD, at one of the National Test Sites such as PMRF, Hawaii, or in the ocean near one of these sites.  Comment on how the non-mobile launcher test stand will be broken down, transported, and stored at different test locations.  Provide any known physical or environmental limitations/constraints that will prohibit the use of the test stand at multiple locations.
6. Maintainability - In the past, the submerged launcher capability slowly eroded due to the high cost of maintaining the facility or set of facilities.  Provide comments on how this platform will accommodate both periods of testing and periods of storage, and will still be usable within a short time frame.    
7. Crossflow ? Describe methods to reach desired dynamic water flow conditions induced by submarine forward way and sea state conditions (i.e. crossflow up to 10 knots) at the muzzle face of the test platform.  The intent is to adequately replicate operational launch conditions.  Describe ROM costs and design considerations for different methods. 
8. Future modifications - Provide recommended future modifications (if any) that would make the test stand more robust for integration testing.
9. Risk - Discuss the risks associated with executing the proposed development plan to deliver the desired hardware to the government.  Also, identify any risks of using the test stand as proposed.
10. Cost - Discuss cost drivers associated with executing the design, fabrication and use of the test platform when going from phase I to phase II and phase II to phase III.
11. Schedule - Discuss project schedule to accomplish each phase.  Discuss constraints that would adversely impact fast tracking the project (i.e. initial operational capability within 18 months of contract go-ahead for phase I & II).

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis seeking potential vendors that have the experience and capability to fulfill the attached requirement.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL OR COST PROPOSAL. NO SOLICITAITON IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME AND REQUESTS FOR SOLICITATION PACKAGES WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.

This sources sought announcement is in support of market research being conducted by the National Institutes of Health to identify small business sources (including small business programs:  8(a), HubZone, and Service Disabled Veteran) that are capable of performing the requirements identified in the Description and in the paragraphs below.  The intended procurement will be classified under 2007 NAICS 541712 (previously 541710 under the 2002 NAICS).

The Primate Aging Database (PAD) is a searchable database developed to allow analysis of age-related traits in non-human primates (NHP).  Currently, the database contains data from 20 species at 11 different institutions, comprising over 3000 individual animals and 500,000 data points.  About 80% of the data is from rhesus monkeys.  Current data fields are primarily lifespan, body composition parameters, and blood chemistry parameters, although addition of other parameters is possible.  The PAD is useful for analyses of species differences in normal aging processes, studies on biomarkers of normal aging and age-related pathologies, and determination of baseline levels in geriatric NHP colonies.  The PAD was written on a Microsoft Access platform and was converted to a web-based platform under the current contract, N01-AG-3-1014.

The purpose of the Primate Aging Database (PAD) is to compile data on biological measurements in non-human primates (NHP) from as many primate colonies as possible and disseminate this information to the scientific community.  This will provide a new research resource to allow investigators to analyze the effect of aging on many biomarkers with the goal of identifying parameters that define the aging process.  It will serve the added function of providing normative values for researchers and veterinarians providing care to aged NHP, allowing them to better assess the health of their charges.  This resource will promote advances in aging research without requiring additional animals since it will bring together a large amount of data generated by many different institutions and investigators.

The objective of this contract is to host and maintain PAD on the Contractor?s server, provide it to investigators in the research community, provide technical assistance with its use, and continue to add data on biological measurements in non-human primates.

The Government will provide to the Contractor the PAD and software that have already been developed.  All data in the database, the software, and the codebook shall remain property of the Government.

Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall provide all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, and equipment (except for those to be furnished by the government as specified elsewhere in this contract) to perform the work required by this contract as set forth below.

Specifically, the Contractor shall:

1.  Transfer PAD and the PAD customer database to a secure server at the Contractor?s facility and maintain a back-up copy, provide all maintenance and repairs to keep the server functioning properly.  A transition period of no more than one month should be proposed, and the PAD shall be off-line for no more than 48 hours during the transition period.

Note:  offerors should provide details on the transfer of the database and how the transition period will be structured.

2.  Provide the PAD to investigators in the research community via the password protected website.  All costs associated with distribution of the PAD to investigators shall be borne by the contract.  As liaison with the research community, the Contractor shall be responsible for ev

<SUBJECT>A -- Management of the Primate Aging Database
<SOLNBR>NIHAG2007001
<RESPDATE>091307
<CONTACT>Louis Kuta, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-496-8024, Fax 301-402-0178, Email kutal@od.nih.gov
<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis seeking potential vendors that have the experience and capability to fulfill the attached requirement.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL OR COST PROPOSAL. NO SOLICITAITON IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME AND REQUESTS FOR SOLICITATION PACKAGES WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.

This sources sought announcement is in support of market research being conducted by the National Institutes of Health to identify small business sources (including small business programs:  8(a), HubZone, and Service Disabled Veteran) that are capable of performing the requirements identified in the Description and in the paragraphs below.  The intended procurement will be classified under 2007 NAICS 541712 (previously 541710 under the 2002 NAICS).

The Primate Aging Database (PAD) is a searchable database developed to allow analysis of age-related traits in non-human primates (NHP).  Currently, the database contains data from 20 species at 11 different institutions, comprising over 3000 individual animals and 500,000 data points.  About 80% of the data is from rhesus monkeys.  Current data fields are primarily lifespan, body composition parameters, and blood chemistry parameters, although addition of other parameters is possible.  The PAD is useful for analyses of species differences in normal aging processes, studies on biomarkers of normal aging and age-related pathologies, and determination of baseline levels in geriatric NHP colonies.  The PAD was written on a Microsoft Access platform and was converted to a web-based platform under the current contract, N01-AG-3-1014.

The purpose of the Primate Aging Database (PAD) is to compile data on biological measurements in non-human primates (NHP) from as many primate colonies as possible and disseminate this information to the scientific community.  This will provide a new research resource to allow investigators to analyze the effect of aging on many biomarkers with the goal of identifying parameters that define the aging process.  It will serve the added function of providing normative values for researchers and veterinarians providing care to aged NHP, allowing them to better assess the health of their charges.  This resource will promote advances in aging research without requiring additional animals since it will bring together a large amount of data generated by many different institutions and investigators.

The objective of this contract is to host and maintain PAD on the Contractor?s server, provide it to investigators in the research community, provide technical assistance with its use, and continue to add data on biological measurements in non-human primates.

The Government will provide to the Contractor the PAD and software that have already been developed.  All data in the database, the software, and the codebook shall remain property of the Government.

Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall provide all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, and equipment (except for those to be furnished by the government as specified elsewhere in this contract) to perform the work required by this contract as set forth below.

Specifically, the Contractor shall:

1.  Transfer PAD and the PAD customer database to a secure server at the Contractor?s facility and maintain a back-up copy, provide all maintenance and repairs to keep the server functioning properly.  A transition period of no more than one month should be proposed, and the PAD shall be off-line for no more than 48 hours during the transition period.

Note:  offerors should provide details on the transfer of the database and how the transition period will be structured.

2.  Provide the PAD to investigators in the research community via the password protected website.  All costs associated with distribution of the PAD to investigators shall be borne by the contract.  As liaison with the research community, the Contractor shall be responsible for evaluating all applications for a password to PAD to ensure the users are legitimate researchers and for informing investigators of the publication policy as set forth by the PAD Steering Committee and communicated to the Contractor by the Project Officer.

3.  Provide technical assistance to investigators using PAD, through one-on-one consultations and refinements to the codebook.

4.  Fix any reported problems with the PAD software and the hardware housing the database.  Any significant problems affecting utilization of the database by investigators shall be reported to the Project Officer immediately.  The Contractor shall keep a log of all significant problems encountered by investigators attempting to access PAD, and report these problems in the semi-annual progress reports (4.A. below).

5.  Maintain viewer controls on access to data.  Data in PAD is available to users as means, medians and graphs, but individual data points are not identified.  Only submitters are allowed to see their own raw data.  The Project Officer will inform the Contractor of any changes in the policy on data access that the PAD Steering Committee implements.  The Contractor does not have the authority to make changes to data access without the authorization of the Project Officer.

6.  Solicit new data from the research community as directed by the Project Officer, enter the data into PAD, and perform quality control analyses of the data.  Data will be solicited from institutions that have already contributed data to PAD, as updates and data on new animals becomes available, and from new sources identified by the Project Officer or by the Contractor and approved by the Project Officer.  The Contractor shall be responsible for informing investigators of the data ownership policy, as developed by the PAD Steering Committee and provided by the Project Officer.

Note: the format in which the data will be submitted will vary from source to source.  Some data will be submitted electronically in a format compatible with electronic transfer into the database; other data will be submitted as paper copies that need to be manually entered.

7.  Maintain a list of all recipients of the passwords to the database and all publications resulting from the use of PAD.

8.  Maintain a back-up copy of the database, codebook and software to protect against accidental loss.  The back up should be up-dated every week and stored off-site or on-site in a fireproof safe.

9.  Provide security for all computers that contain copies of the database and all supporting information required by this statement of work, including locking down computers and using password protection for access to the computer files containing information relating to the database and investigators using the database.

10.  Advertise the PAD by demonstrations at scientific meetings.  Contract personnel shall attend and sponsor a booth at 2-3 scientific meetings per year, to be approved in advance by the Project Officer, and provide directed, hands-on demonstrations of the PAD.

The period of performance will be based on continued scientific interest in this resource.  Therefore, a contract consisting of one base year and four option years is suggested.  The anticipated start date is September 1, 2008 continuing through August 31, 2013.

Semi-annual progress reports shall be delivered to the Project Officer (1 copy) and the Contracting Officer (1 copy) within thirty (30) calendar days of the end of each six month period of the contract.  The initial report shall be submitted for the first full six months of the contract performance including any fractional part of the initial month.

<DESC>Amendment I:
The relase date for the solicitation will be on or about January 10, 2008, with a pre-solicitation meeting to be held the week of January 28, 2008.  Further information on the pre-solicitation meeting will be given in the solicitation posting.  

Original Notice:
The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), is contracting on behalf of the National Institute of Standards and Technology for a general contractor for a new laboratory building (B1E) in Boulder, Colorado.  

The B1E will be one of the most technologically advanced buildings in the world.  The laboratory combines the features of close temperature control, vibration isolation, air cleanliness, and demanding power quality into a facility of crucial national importance.   The B1E consists of an L4 High Performance Lab, L5 Instrument Lab and L6 Precision. Temperature control will be achieved down to +/- 0.1 degree C in some areas, humidity control to +/- 5%, air filtration to M3.5 (class 100), and vibration control to < 3 micrometers/second.  At the B1E, electrical substations will be installed to transform site high voltage of 13.2 kV down to 480/277 V. State-of-the-art clean power quality will be required to meet stringent lab requirements and eliminate variables from scientific research. The new facility will provide for the current needs of quantum science research in computing and communications, nanotechnology, improved atomic clock research, high speed electronic measurements, and microfabrication of research devices. 

The proposed B1E gross building area is approximately 137,000 square feet. Environmental and space requirements for the building are based on extensive programmatic studies of NIST?s most technically demanding scientific programs, many of which directly or indirectly support US competitiveness.  The building environmental requirements for programs slated for the B1E cannot be economically met with renovated laboratory space; therefore, the B1E is a necessity for NIST?s continued long-term support of US industrial competitiveness in the world market. 

The solicitation will be published on or about December 5, 2007, with an award anticipated for the summer of 2008.  The estimated price range of this project is $50,000,000 to $80,000,000.  Completion time for this project is estimated at nine hundred (900) calendar days after the written Notice to Proceed.  All project requirements and submission information will be available electronically and without charge through Fed Biz Opps on or about December 5, 2007.

Source selection will be made using best value trade off process (FAR 15.101-1).   The government will not pay for any information solicited.  Offers that do not meet all the requirements or are not submitted within the allotted time will not be considered.  

All contractors doing business with the Government are required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) and the On-line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  To register with the CCR and ORCA and become eligible to receive an award, all offerors must have a Dun & Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) identifier. A DUNS number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun & Bradstreet at 800-234-3867 or on line at 
https://www.dnb.com and click on ?get a D&B D-U-N-S number?.


This procurement is open to both large and small business concerns.  The NAICS code applicable to this solicitation is 236220, and the corresponding size standard for determining whether or not a firm qualifies as a small business is $31 million in average, annual receipts (gross) over the past three years.  Although this procurement is not set aside for small business, small firms (including woman-owned, minority-owned, HUBZone, Veteran-Owned small firms, and service disabled Veteran-Owned business) are strongly encouraged to participate in the construction and renovation of Federal facilities.  In accordance with 15 USC 631, large businesses will be required to provide these small firms the maximum practical opportunities to participate as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.  Each large firm will be required to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan that meets, and preferably exceeds, the minimum acceptable subcontracting target goals established by the Small Business Administration (SBA).  An acceptable subcontracting plan must be reviewed and approved by the SBA prior to award of this contract.  Small businesses are not subject to this requirement.  However, ALL firms seeking consideration for this contract will need to demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the highest possible subcontracting goals for local (Denver/Boulder area) business concern participation.  Please refer to the SBA website for additional details at www.sba.gov.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Request for Qualifications Regarding Redevelopment of the Smithsonian's Arts and Industries Building
<SOLNBR>T08SOL00003A
<RESPDATE>010708
<ARCHDATE>01222008
<CONTACT>Thomas Dempsey, Attorney Advisor, Phone 202/633-7259, Fax 202/633-7305, Email dempseyt@si.edu
<DESC>The above-referenced RFQ originally posted to Federal Business Opportunity is amended to include the following responses to  submitted questions:



1.	Will the responses submitted as part of the RFQ process be proprietary?  

Answer:  The Responses submitted as part of the RFQ process will be kept confidential and will not be shared with those not a part of the decision making process. The Smithsonian Institution (SI) will treat information contained in the responses as proprietary in keeping with applicable law. 


2.	Can Smithsonian issue a Request for Proposal based on responses submitted in response to the RFQ process?

Answer:  SI may issue a Request for Proposal as outlined in the RFQ; however, that decision has not yet been made.  Please note the answer to Question One above. See also paragraph three, under ?Introduction? on page 2 of the RFQ.

 
3.	Will Smithsonian make available the sign-in sheets from the scheduled tours of the Arts and Industries Building?  

Answer:  The sign in sheets will not be made available at this time.

 
4.	Can Smithsonian clarify its policy with regard to corporate sponsorship, particularly as it relates to potential naming rights of buildings, programs, and exhibits?

Answer:  Other than the language which is contained in the RFQ, SI cannot provide further clarification at this time:
?Any exterior signage will be subject to approval. The name etched on the outside of the building - National Museum - and the current name of the building ? Arts and Industries ? must be maintained. The building cannot be renamed for an individual, family, group, firm or corporation, although naming opportunities for interior spaces may be possible.? 
5.	The RFQ states that the costs for the required renovations are up to $65,000,000; however, the Washington Post December 13th edition stated that required capital repairs were $200,000,000.  Could you please clarify the difference in cost estimates?

Answer:  SI bases its calculation on a recent independent cost estimate which, as indicated in the RFQ, is for ?the work necessary to make the building structurally and environmentally sound and to provide a ?conditioned shell? ready for interior fitout.?  The figure quoted in the RFQ represents the estimated cost of the work outlined in the RFQ to update the building (please refer to Paragraph III. 4. on page 5 of the RFQ for more detail). Additional costs for outfitting the space will be dependent upon the individual proposals.

 	
6.	Can Smithsonian participate in any cash flow in excess of debt service or amortized costs necessary to renovate the Arts and Industries Building?  If so, does this cash flow participation have to be earmarked for other Smithsonian programs or facilities costs? 

Answer:  SI can participate in ?cash flow? as described; however, it has not been determined if and to what extent it would participate.  Therefore SI would be willing to consider proposals that address this type of structure.   At this time, SI does not have any intent to participate in funding the redevelopment or subsidizing negative operating costs.  
SI cannot address whether ?cash flow? participation would be earmarked for other Smithsonian program or facilities costs.


7.	Is there a requirement that the windows on the building be transparent? As a museum designer would need to control the light in an interior exhibition space, could opaque glass or other materials be used on the exterior windows of the four major quadrants of the building?

Answer:	All determinations regarding specific alterations to the property will be assessed once a development plan has been advanced.  Specific prohibitions regarding the work proposed have not been determined, and thus SI cannot comment on whether such work would be acceptable or unacceptable.  Prospective respondents are referred to the RFQ for explanation of the review process.  All alterations will be subject to approvals and should be consistent with the historical nature of the building and environment.

8.	Would it be OK to open only two entrances to the general public, one on the Mall (north) side and one on the Independence Avenue (south) side? That's the model used for most of the other museums on the National Mall. Then the East entrance would be available for deliveries and the West could be used as an emergency exit.

Answer:    See answer to Question Number 7 Above.

9.	Would it be permissible to use the West Hall as a restaurant space and the East Hall for a computer-based learning center or do you require that those halls be without any impediments?

Answer:	See answer to Question Number 7 Above.

10.	For museum purposes, would it be possible to just enclose the four large quadrants for humidity and other environmental controls without retrofitting the entire building, including the rotunda and four halls?

Answer:	The interconnection of halls, courts and ranges is an important feature of the interior of the building.  Any proposed modification would have to respect the open visual character.  See also answer to Question Number 7 Above.

11.	How many square feet are there on each of the two floors in each of the four quadrants that could be used as museum exhibition space?

Answer:	The answer is entirely dependent on the uses and configuration proposed by the respondent, including the construction or removal of building elements.  A graphic scale is shown on the floor plans provided with the RFQ and may be used as a guide in determining approximate building areas. 

12.	Is it still possible -- using the building program proposed by the National Museum for African American History and Culture
in the report from its Presidential Study Commission -- to create three levels of underground space towards the north and east of the A&I footprint?

Answer:	The construction of underground space adjacent to the building would entail substantial additional costs and technical challenges.  Its feasibility would also be controlled by the vigorous reviews of several entities.  SI cannot comment further on the ability to construct this space nor can SI comment on the suitability of such a plan. 

13. How many square feet could be developed underground to complement the space in the A&I Building?

Answer:	See Answer to Question Number 12 above.


14. Can elevators and escalators be installed inside of each quadrant?

Answer:	See Answer to Question Number 7 above

15. Could the four stairways in the rotunda be converted to escalators leading to the balconies of each quadrant?

Answer:	The four stairs are important character-defining features of the rotunda. It is unlikely that they could be changed. Each design would have to be reviewed for its impact on the historic character. See also Answer to Question Number 7 above.


16. If there is the prospect that a Presidential Commission could be studying, among other things, the site and governance of a major new national museum that would include exploring use of the A&I Building and considering whether or not the museum would be part of the Smithsonian, could a final decision on the disposition of the A&I Building await the report of that Commission? Would you allow a reasonable amount of time for this? 

Answer:	SI is unable to address a question of such speculative nature.  The exploration of a partnership to revitalize the Arts and Industries Building and the language of the RFQ were reviewed and approved by Congress. 


17. While the RE would have to maintain the integrity of the building design and exterior brickwork, is it possible to change the color of the paint on the exterior window frames and other exterior paint detailing provided that there is approval obtained from the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission on Fine Arts?

Answer:	See Answer to Question Number 7 above.


18. With respect to signage, the words "National Museum" etched in stone would work perfectly for a national museum at this location. But why must the current name of the building be maintained? A plaque somewhere discussing the history of the building and its names would be great. But if the museum that it houses is called the National Museum of the American People, it would make little sense to maintain the Arts and Industries nomenclature. Who is responsible for requiring the Arts and Industries name on the building in its new incarnation? I would call for reconsideration of that requirement. The name would be confusing as the building in my proposal would have nothing to do with the arts or industry.

Answer:	The RFQ explicitly states that the name on the building shall not be changed.  This decision has been made in this regard and, until further notice, shall not be changed.  Decisions with regard to other signage, as well as all other changes, are subject to consideration once a development plan has been advanced.  Prospective respondents are referred to the RFQ for explanation of the review process.

19. Is there a time frame in mind that the Smithsonian has for developing the A&I Building?

Answer:	The RFQ requires that respondents propose a schedule for redevelopment and occupancy:
?The RFQ proposal will be carefully evaluated against the following factors:
. . .
Demonstrating a well defined track record of successful operations, financial stability and the financial capability to proceed with full development within 24 months of execution of an agreement with the Smithsonian.?

20. Are there questions and answers from others that you will be sharing with those who have expressed an interest in the RFQ?

Answer:	Yes.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Request for Qualifications Regarding Redevelopment of the Smithsonian's Arts and Industries Building
<SOLNBR>T08SOL00003B
<RESPDATE>010708
<ARCHDATE>01222008
<CONTACT>Thomas Dempsey, Attorney Advisor, Phone 202/633-7259, Fax 202/633-7305, Email dempseyt@si.edu
<DESC>The above-referenced RFQ originally posted to Federal Business Opportunity is amended to include the following responses to  submitted questions:



1.	Will the responses submitted as part of the RFQ process be proprietary?  

Answer:  The Responses submitted as part of the RFQ process will be kept confidential and will not be shared with those not a part of the decision making process. The Smithsonian Institution (SI) will treat information contained in the responses as proprietary in keeping with applicable law. 


2.	Can Smithsonian issue a Request for Proposal based on responses submitted in response to the RFQ process?

Answer:  SI may issue a Request for Proposal as outlined in the RFQ; however, that decision has not yet been made.  Please note the answer to Question One above. See also paragraph three, under ?Introduction? on page 2 of the RFQ.

 
3.	Will Smithsonian make available the sign-in sheets from the scheduled tours of the Arts and Industries Building?  

Answer:  The sign in sheets will not be made available at this time.

 
4.	Can Smithsonian clarify its policy with regard to corporate sponsorship, particularly as it relates to potential naming rights of buildings, programs, and exhibits?

Answer:  Other than the language which is contained in the RFQ, SI cannot provide further clarification at this time:
?Any exterior signage will be subject to approval. The name etched on the outside of the building - National Museum - and the current name of the building ? Arts and Industries ? must be maintained. The building cannot be renamed for an individual, family, group, firm or corporation, although naming opportunities for interior spaces may be possible.? 
5.	The RFQ states that the costs for the required renovations are up to $65,000,000; however, the Washington Post December 13th edition stated that required capital repairs were $200,000,000.  Could you please clarify the difference in cost estimates?

Answer:  SI bases its calculation on a recent independent cost estimate which, as indicated in the RFQ, is for ?the work necessary to make the building structurally and environmentally sound and to provide a ?conditioned shell? ready for interior fitout.?  The figure quoted in the RFQ represents the estimated cost of the work outlined in the RFQ to update the building (please refer to Paragraph III. 4. on page 5 of the RFQ for more detail). Additional costs for outfitting the space will be dependent upon the individual proposals.

 	
6.	Can Smithsonian participate in any cash flow in excess of debt service or amortized costs necessary to renovate the Arts and Industries Building?  If so, does this cash flow participation have to be earmarked for other Smithsonian programs or facilities costs? 

Answer:  SI can participate in ?cash flow? as described; however, it has not been determined if and to what extent it would participate.  Therefore SI would be willing to consider proposals that address this type of structure.   At this time, SI does not have any intent to participate in funding the redevelopment or subsidizing negative operating costs.  
SI cannot address whether ?cash flow? participation would be earmarked for other Smithsonian program or facilities costs.


7.	Is there a requirement that the windows on the building be transparent? As a museum designer would need to control the light in an interior exhibition space, could opaque glass or other materials be used on the exterior windows of the four major quadrants of the building?

Answer:	All determinations regarding specific alterations to the property will be assessed once a development plan has been advanced.  Specific prohibitions regarding the work proposed have not been determined, and thus SI cannot comment on whether such work would be acceptable or unacceptable.  Prospective respondents are referred to the RFQ for explanation of the review process.  All alterations will be subject to approvals and should be consistent with the historical nature of the building and environment.

8.	Would it be OK to open only two entrances to the general public, one on the Mall (north) side and one on the Independence Avenue (south) side? That's the model used for most of the other museums on the National Mall. Then the East entrance would be available for deliveries and the West could be used as an emergency exit.

Answer:    See answer to Question Number 7 Above.

9.	Would it be permissible to use the West Hall as a restaurant space and the East Hall for a computer-based learning center or do you require that those halls be without any impediments?

Answer:	See answer to Question Number 7 Above.

10.	For museum purposes, would it be possible to just enclose the four large quadrants for humidity and other environmental controls without retrofitting the entire building, including the rotunda and four halls?

Answer:	The interconnection of halls, courts and ranges is an important feature of the interior of the building.  Any proposed modification would have to respect the open visual character.  See also answer to Question Number 7 Above.

11.	How many square feet are there on each of the two floors in each of the four quadrants that could be used as museum exhibition space?

Answer:	The answer is entirely dependent on the uses and configuration proposed by the respondent, including the construction or removal of building elements.  A graphic scale is shown on the floor plans provided with the RFQ and may be used as a guide in determining approximate building areas. 

12.	Is it still possible -- using the building program proposed by the National Museum for African American History and Culture
in the report from its Presidential Study Commission -- to create three levels of underground space towards the north and east of the A&I footprint?

Answer:	The construction of underground space adjacent to the building would entail substantial additional costs and technical challenges.  Its feasibility would also be controlled by the vigorous reviews of several entities.  SI cannot comment further on the ability to construct this space nor can SI comment on the suitability of such a plan. 

13. How many square feet could be developed underground to complement the space in the A&I Building?

Answer:	See Answer to Question Number 12 above.


14. Can elevators and escalators be installed inside of each quadrant?

Answer:	See Answer to Question Number 7 above

15. Could the four stairways in the rotunda be converted to escalators leading to the balconies of each quadrant?

Answer:	The four stairs are important character-defining features of the rotunda. It is unlikely that they could be changed. Each design would have to be reviewed for its impact on the historic character. See also Answer to Question Number 7 above.


16. If there is the prospect that a Presidential Commission could be studying, among other things, the site and governance of a major new national museum that would include exploring use of the A&I Building and considering whether or not the museum would be part of the Smithsonian, could a final decision on the disposition of the A&I Building await the report of that Commission? Would you allow a reasonable amount of time for this? 

Answer:	SI is unable to address a question of such speculative nature.  The exploration of a partnership to revitalize the Arts and Industries Building and the language of the RFQ were reviewed and approved by Congress. 


17. While the RE would have to maintain the integrity of the building design and exterior brickwork, is it possible to change the color of the paint on the exterior window frames and other exterior paint detailing provided that there is approval obtained from the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission on Fine Arts?

Answer:	See Answer to Question Number 7 above.


18. With respect to signage, the words "National Museum" etched in stone would work perfectly for a national museum at this location. But why must the current name of the building be maintained? A plaque somewhere discussing the history of the building and its names would be great. But if the museum that it houses is called the National Museum of the American People, it would make little sense to maintain the Arts and Industries nomenclature. Who is responsible for requiring the Arts and Industries name on the building in its new incarnation? I would call for reconsideration of that requirement. The name would be confusing as the building in my proposal would have nothing to do with the arts or industry.

Answer:	The RFQ explicitly states that the name on the building shall not be changed.  This decision has been made in this regard and, until further notice, shall not be changed.  Decisions with regard to other signage, as well as all other changes, are subject to consideration once a development plan has been advanced.  Prospective respondents are referred to the RFQ for explanation of the review process.

19. Is there a time frame in mind that the Smithsonian has for developing the A&I Building?

Answer:	The RFQ requires that respondents propose a schedule for redevelopment and occupancy:
?The RFQ proposal will be carefully evaluated against the following factors:
. . .
Demonstrating a well defined track record of successful operations, financial stability and the financial capability to proceed with full development within 24 months of execution of an agreement with the Smithsonian.?

20. Are there questions and answers from others that you will be sharing with those who have expressed an interest in the RFQ?

Answer:	Yes.

<ARCHDATE>12192008
<CONTACT>Joe Pratt Contract Specialist 2083785139     jpratt@pn.usbr.gov;
<DESC>This announcement is not a request for proposals nor a request for SF 330s.  The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), Pacific Northwest Regional Office Contracts Group, intends to negotiate a sole-source contract for Architect and Engineering Services (NAICS Code 541330) in support of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) Habitat Program in the Upper and Middle Fork John Day River sub-basins in Oregon.  The National Marine Fisheries Service's Biological Opinion for the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS) requires Reclamation to complete off-site habitat work to mitigate for the effects of the FCRPS operation and configuration.  The goal of the off-site work is to improve migration, spawning, and rearing habitat in priority sub-basins.  Among other things, the Biological Opinion requires Reclamation to address flow, passage, and screening problems in the Upper Mainstem and Middle Fork sub-basins of the John Day River.  Much of the work currently accomplished by the Grant County Soil and Water Conservation District (District) contributes significantly to achieving habitat improvements in these areas.  As a local subdivision of Oregon State Government with a licensed professional engineer on staff, the District is a public body permitted to complete engineering work in the State of Oregon.  Accordingly, Reclamation intends to negotiate a contract for architect and engineering services with the District to further Reclamation's progress in meeting its habitat improvement obligations by enhancing the District's abilities to complete relevant planning and design activities.  The participation of the District in project planning and design will assure local coordination and input to projects, expedite project completion, and increase the opportunity for implementing a broader range of projects.  These projects should ultimately lead to greater adoption of improved watershed practices within the community.  In addition, Reclamation's contract with the District is expected to enhance program work by providing: improved knowledge of the study area and subbasins; familiarity with the subbasins' natural, cultural and recreational resource status, problems, and needs (existing and potential); local understanding of Reclamation's responsibilities under the current Biological Opinion; engagement of the various publics who have an interest in the development and management of water resources that may be affected by activities pursued under the BiOp; and coordinated use of pertinent studies, reports, GIS databases, and maps of the area.  Reclamation believes that the District is uniquely qualified to provide these services, as it has legal jurisdiction, direct management responsibilities, demonstrated expertise, and special knowledge in planning, design and implementation of fish habitat improvement facilities and measures in the John Day River sub-basins.  In addition, the District is closely familiar with specific fish passage problems related to agricultural activities and has developed working relationships with landowners and other organizations involved with habitat enhancement throughout the sub-basins.  Furthermore, Reclamation has previously worked cooperatively with the District to complete successful projects in the sub-basins under a similar contract awarded to the District in 2002.  As a result, a contract to enhance the District's continued involvement and Reclamation's close coordination with their ongoing local program will ensure that program continuity is maintained, applicable State and Federal standards are met, and fish and wildlife interests, enhancement opportunities, and issues are clearly identified, prioritized, and dealt with accordingly.  Because of the District's unique qualifications and position in subbasin habitat enhancement relative to Reclamation's needs for the above-referenced services, Reclamation intends to negotiate the contract using other than full and open competition procedures.  The period of performance of the contract will be for fiscal years 2008 through 2013, with contract funding availability and amounts to be determined annually.  No solicitation is available. Parties who believe they have knowledge of the John Day ESA Habitat Program and related landowner issues sufficient to provide relevant AE services may send an SF 330 demonstrating their firm's qualifications to the address listed above. No phone or fax inquiries will be considered. See Numbered Note 22.

U.S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION
Small Business Size Standards: Waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule
AGENCY:  U.S. Small Business Administration.
ACTION: Notice of intent to Waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for All Other Miscellaneous Electrical Equipment and Component Manufacturing.
SUMMARY:  The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is considering granting a request for a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for All Other Miscellaneous Electrical Equipment and Component Manufacturing.
According to the request, no small business manufacturers supply these classes of products to the Federal government.  If granted, the waiver would allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses; service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or SBA?s 8(a) Business Development Program.  
DATE: Comments and source information must be submitted [WITHIN 15 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES].
ADDRESSES:  You may submit comments and source information to Pamela M. McClam, Program Analyst, U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Government Contracting, 409 3rd Street, SW, Suite 8800, Washington, DC 20416.
FOR FURTHER INFORMATI0N CONTACT: Pamela M. McClam, Program Analyst, by telephone at (202) 205-205-7408; by FAX at (202) 481-4783; or by email at Pamela.McClam@sba.gov 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Section 8(a)(17) of the Small Business Act (Act), 15 U.S.C.? 637(a)(17), requires that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or SBA?s 8(a) Business Development Program provide the product of a small business manufacturer or processor, if the recipient is other than the actual manufacturer or processor of the product. This requirement is commonly referred to as the Nonmanufacturer Rule.  The SBA regulations imposing this requirement are found at 13 CFR ?121.406(b).  Section 8(a)(17)(b)(iv) of the Act authorizes SBA to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for any "class of products" for which there are no small business manufacturers or processors available to participate in the Federal market.  
     As implemented in SBA?s regulations at 13 CFR ?121.1202(c), in order to be considered available to participate in the Federal market for a class of products, a small business manufacturer must have submitted a proposal for a contract solicitation or received a contract from the Federal government within the last 24 months.
The SBA defines "class of products" based on six digit coding system.  The coding system is the Office of Management and Budget North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).

B. COMPONENTS:
The system design is subject to change.  The primary components of the system include:

1. Two ETVs with rotator decks capable of handling one 463L pallet (88 inches by 108 inches with maximum normal height of 108 inches and maximum normal gross weight of 10,500 pounds).  The ETVs shall be capable of fully-automatic operation (no operator on board), semi-automatic operation (operator interface via inventory control system), manual operation (operator interface via buttons and joysticks on the ETV with no inventory control system interface), and shall also have a maintenance mode.

2. The pallet storage enclosure (PSE) is configured as shown on the attached drawings.  The enclosure includes the rack structure, foundation, roof, sides, powered doors, lights, sprinkler system, and ventilation.  The PSE is approximately 480 feet x 50 feet and contains 4 storage levels for 463L pallets with a storage location clear height of 124 inches.

3. Sixteen staging docks with walkways between them.  Each staging dock has a forklift and k-loader interface on the air side.  A scale is provided near the PSE door to verify the weight of inbound pallets.  A small enclosure for personnel to use a computer will be provided near the scales.  The staging docks shall be long enough to store and stage enough pallets to fill a 60k-loader (6 pallets with the wide-edge leading) with adequate space to have only 1 pallet in either orientation on the scale.  The conveyor between the scale and the ETV shall not be used for storage or included in the 60k-loader load; it shall only be used for staging to and from the ETV.

4. Four pallet lifts and associated powered transfer conveyor.  The pits will be provided as part of the new terminal.  Note two of the lifts are oriented for each possible pallet orientation, and that two of the lifts interface with automatic transfer vehicles used for processing pallets arriving already built-up.

5. Storage conveyors on 4 levels totaling 265 (72 on each of the 3 upper levels and 49 on the lower level).  The storage conveyors are 128 inches long, powered by the ETV extractor, have a walkway behind them, and have decking between the rollers.

6. A multipallet build-up and breakdown station located beneath a 35-ton crane.  This conveyor is as long as a staging dock but does not interface with the ETV.  This is a powered conveyor with a built-in scale with center-of-balance for weighing multipallet trains up to 60 feet long.  There are collapsible walkways along both sides.  The crane roof shall be approximately 60 feet x 60 feet and shall provide a minimum of 30 feet of clear hook height.

7. A conveyor system for cold pallets and for the vault.  These systems have powered conveyor that interfaces with the ETV and non-powered conveyor requiring personnel to manually move the pallets.  

8. An inventory control system with cameras, maintenance tracking system, and other enhancements similar to recent USAF projects.  The software will interface with an existing USAF transportation software system.

9. Provide supporting equipment such as a generator with fuel tank and pump house for the sprinkler system.

10. A canopy over the staging docks as shown on the attached drawings.

11. Provide spare parts similar to recent USAF projects.

12. Provide training similar to recent USAF projects.

13. Provide documentation similar to recent USAF projects, except manuals shall be provided in both English and Japanese.


C. NOTABLE DETAILS:
The system is similar to previous Air Force systems with the following highlights:

1. The PSE shall be fully enclosed to provide a safe environment for automatic ETV operations.  Standing seam metal roof and metal siding is acceptable.

2. There are seismic and typhoon-force wind requirements in this area.

3. Conveyors and rack structure will be galvanized.  The ETVs will be painted safety yellow.

4. Include the standard USAF manual operating procedures.

5. All replaceable components (mechanical and electrical) shall have a distributor in Japan so spare parts are easy to obtain.  Components without a Japanese source of supply will not be accepted unless there are no other alternatives.

<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) MILSATCOM Systems Wing (MCSW) intends to release a solicitation to acquire Command and Control System-Consolidated (CCS-C) Block 2 upgrades in support of Transformational Satellite Communications (TSAT) S-Band operations, Wideband Global SATCOM  (WGS) Block 2 satellites, and other MILSATCOM programs.  In addition, CCS-C architecture extensions will support NetCentric command and control and Information Assurance requirements identified by Headquarters Air Force Space Command will be supported. The CCS-C development and deployment will support the launch, on-orbit operations, and anomaly resolution of the TSAT satellites from its command and control system through the AFSCN (Air Force Satellite Control Network). CCS-C capabilities include: activity planning; telemetry processing; commanding; orbit management; resource management; space vehicle and ground system simulation; support planning and execution; and interfaces with dedicated ground and payload control systems.  Satellite platform and payload state-of-health operations include launch, early-orbit, on-orbit, anomaly resolution, and disposal operations.  Future migration to USB (Unified S-Band) waveforms and data formats shall be supported.  Contractor must be able to sustain existing CCS-C hardware, software, databases, and command procedures.  Continuing upgrades to address Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) hardware and software obsolescence are anticipated.  

The period of performance is anticipated to be for 10 years and will begin in FY09 lasting through FY19. This is a follow-on effort to the existing CCS-C development, procurement and support contract currently performed by Integral Systems Inc. (ISI), 5000 Philadelphia Way, Lanham, MD 20706-4417.  The projected Request for Proposal (RFP) release date for this effort is October 2008.  On-site locations include but are not limited to Schriever AFB, CO and Vandenberg AFB, CA.  A minimum DoD security clearance of Secret is mandatory for all personnel supporting this effort.  

Interested Contractors must submit an unclassified Statement of Capability (SOC) by 5:00 pm (Pacific) on Tuesday, 8 January 2008 demonstrating knowledge of CCS-C hardware and software design and test procedures.  The submission must also include an assessment of actual, potential, or perceptions of Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) through the submission of an OCI Mitigation Plan.  The mitigation plan will be evaluated to ensure proper safeguards are implemented or will be implemented to protect the Government's interests and to identify perceptions of bias and unmitigable OCIs in accordance with FAR 9.5. OCIs can occur at any level; prime, subcontractor, or other types of teammates.  Additionally, there are two underlying principles of OCI; 1) conflicting roles that might bias or impair a contractor's judgment, and 2) unfair competitive advantage (where a competing contractor has access to proprietary information of a competitor(s) or has access to source selection information that is not available to all competitors). Negative replies are requested indicating no actual, potential, or perceptions of OCI were identified. The OCI plans must also be in compliance with the current version of the SMC OCI checklist, attached and also available upon request from the contracting officer, Herbert Countee. 

The SOC shall not exceed 20 one-sided pages in length.  This page limit is for the SOC only and does not include the required OCI Mitigation Plan submission  Response must be submitted by e-mail in electronic form in MS Word 2002 or higher or PDF Format.  All responses must conform to 8.5 by 11.0 inch pages, with font no smaller than 12 point.  

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only; it does not constitute an RFP.  Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding on the Government. The Government will not recognize any cost associated with submission of a SOC.

<SUBJECT>A -- Management of the Primate Aging Database
<SOLNBR>NIHAG2007001
<RESPDATE>091307
<CONTACT>Louis Kuta, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-496-8024, Fax 301-402-0178, Email kutal@od.nih.gov
<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis seeking potential vendors that have the experience and capability to fulfill the attached requirement.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL OR COST PROPOSAL. NO SOLICITAITON IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME AND REQUESTS FOR SOLICITATION PACKAGES WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.

This sources sought announcement is in support of market research being conducted by the National Institutes of Health to identify small business sources (including small business programs:  8(a), HubZone, and Service Disabled Veteran) that are capable of performing the requirements identified in the Description and in the paragraphs below.  The intended procurement will be classified under 2007 NAICS 541712 (previously 541710 under the 2002 NAICS).

The Primate Aging Database (PAD) is a searchable database developed to allow analysis of age-related traits in non-human primates (NHP).  Currently, the database contains data from 20 species at 11 different institutions, comprising over 3000 individual animals and 500,000 data points.  About 80% of the data is from rhesus monkeys.  Current data fields are primarily lifespan, body composition parameters, and blood chemistry parameters, although addition of other parameters is possible.  The PAD is useful for analyses of species differences in normal aging processes, studies on biomarkers of normal aging and age-related pathologies, and determination of baseline levels in geriatric NHP colonies.  The PAD was written on a Microsoft Access platform and was converted to a web-based platform under the current contract, N01-AG-3-1014.

The purpose of the Primate Aging Database (PAD) is to compile data on biological measurements in non-human primates (NHP) from as many primate colonies as possible and disseminate this information to the scientific community.  This will provide a new research resource to allow investigators to analyze the effect of aging on many biomarkers with the goal of identifying parameters that define the aging process.  It will serve the added function of providing normative values for researchers and veterinarians providing care to aged NHP, allowing them to better assess the health of their charges.  This resource will promote advances in aging research without requiring additional animals since it will bring together a large amount of data generated by many different institutions and investigators.

The objective of this contract is to host and maintain PAD on the Contractor?s server, provide it to investigators in the research community, provide technical assistance with its use, and continue to add data on biological measurements in non-human primates.

The Government will provide to the Contractor the PAD and software that have already been developed.  All data in the database, the software, and the codebook shall remain property of the Government.

Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall provide all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, and equipment (except for those to be furnished by the government as specified elsewhere in this contract) to perform the work required by this contract as set forth below.

Specifically, the Contractor shall:

1.  Transfer PAD and the PAD customer database to a secure server at the Contractor?s facility and maintain a back-up copy, provide all maintenance and repairs to keep the server functioning properly.  A transition period of no more than one month should be proposed, and the PAD shall be off-line for no more than 48 hours during the transition period.

Note:  offerors should provide details on the transfer of the database and how the transition period will be structured.

2.  Provide the PAD to investigators in the research community via the password protected website.  All costs associated with distribution of the PAD to investigators shall be borne by the contract.  As liaison with the research community, the Contractor shall be responsible for evaluating all applications for a password to PAD to ensure the users are legitimate researchers and for informing investigators of the publication policy as set forth by the PAD Steering Committee and communicated to the Contractor by the Project Officer.

3.  Provide technical assistance to investigators using PAD, through one-on-one consultations and refinements to the codebook.

4.  Fix any reported problems with the PAD software and the hardware housing the database.  Any significant problems affecting utilization of the database by investigators shall be reported to the Project Officer immediately.  The Contractor shall keep a log of all significant problems encountered by investigators attempting to access PAD, and report these problems in the semi-annual progress reports (4.A. below).

5.  Maintain viewer controls on access to data.  Data in PAD is available to users as means, medians and graphs, but individual data points are not identified.  Only submitters are allowed to see their own raw data.  The Project Officer will inform the Contractor of any changes in the policy on data access that the PAD Steering Committee implements.  The Contractor does not have the authority to make changes to data access without the authorization of the Project Officer.

6.  Solicit new data from the research community as directed by the Project Officer, enter the data into PAD, and perform quality control analyses of the data.  Data will be solicited from institutions that have already contributed data to PAD, as updates and data on new animals becomes available, and from new sources identified by the Project Officer or by the Contractor and approved by the Project Officer.  The Contractor shall be responsible for informing investigators of the data ownership policy, as developed by the PAD Steering Committee and provided by the Project Officer.

Note: the format in which the data will be submitted will vary from source to source.  Some data will be submitted electronically in a format compatible with electronic transfer into the database; other data will be submitted as paper copies that need to be manually entered.

7.  Maintain a list of all recipients of the passwords to the database and all publications resulting from the use of PAD.

8.  Maintain a back-up copy of the database, codebook and software to protect against accidental loss.  The back up should be up-dated every week and stored off-site or on-site in a fireproof safe.

9.  Provide security for all computers that contain copies of the database and all supporting information required by this statement of work, including locking down computers and using password protection for access to the computer files containing information relating to the database and investigators using the database.

10.  Advertise the PAD by demonstrations at scientific meetings.  Contract personnel shall attend and sponsor a booth at 2-3 scientific meetings per year, to be approved in advance by the Project Officer, and provide directed, hands-on demonstrations of the PAD.

The period of performance will be based on continued scientific interest in this resource.  Therefore, a contract consisting of one base year and four option years is suggested.  The anticipated start date is September 1, 2008 continuing through August 31, 2013.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-08-184-The-Mathworks-License-Renewals
<RESPDATE>122707
<ARCHDATE>12282007
<CONTACT>Joseph Widdup, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 975-6324, Fax (301) 975-8884, Email joseph.widdup@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), intends to negotiate with The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA, on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) for the purchase of renewal of maintenance for The Mathworks software licenses that NIST currently uses.  

Based on recent market research, NIST believes that The Mathworks, Inc., is the only entity that can satisfy NIST?s requirement for maintenance of the following Mathworks software licenses that NIST previously procured: MATLAB (18 licenses ? Part #SUBML); Control System Toolbox (1 license - Part No. SUBCT); Image Processing Toolbox (1 license - Part No. SUBIP); Optimization Toolbox (1 license - Part No. SUBOP); Signal Processing Toolbox (2 licenses - Part No. SUBSG); Symbolic Math Toolbox (1 license - Part No. SUBSM); Spline Toolbox (1 license - Part No. SUBSP); Statistics Toolbox (2 licenses - Part No. SUBST); Wavelet Toolbox (1 license - Part No. SUBWA).

The NAICS Code is 511210 with a Size Standard of $23.0 million.  NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price type purchase order for a period of twelve months to The Mathworks for this requirement.

Interested parties that are authorized by The Mathworks to sell maintenance renewal for the aforementioned Mathworks software licenses may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before the response date for this notice. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition.  Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to joseph.widdup@nist.gov.

<DESC>This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.215 3 (OCT 1997).   The purpose of this Sources Sought/Market Survey is to identify interested parties capable of providing commercial solutions to meet space-based Earth and space weather observation requirements of the United States Government (USG).   The primary areas of interest include the availability of space and resources on commercial manifested satellite missions; commercial satellite systems that complement or meet the USGEO National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) observing requirements; and potential commercial Earth and Space Weather observation data buys.

To facilitate the preparation of responses from interested parties, NOAA will host an Industry Day on January 28, 2008, at the Department of Commerce Auditorium, Herbert C. Hoover Building, 14th St. and Constitution Ave, NW, Washington, DC.  The Industry Day will serve as the venue for USG representatives to provide presentations on the NOAA mission and goals as they relate to Earth observing capabilities, and present examples of space-based Earth and space weather observation requirements.

All information provided by the USG during Industry Day is for informational purposes only and should not be considered a requirement unless specifically stated in a follow-on solicitation. This information request is for planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  This is not a solicitation for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought announcement seeking feedback from industry on listed requirements as stated in this synopsis and in the attached statement of work.     THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT COMMITTED NOR COMMITTING TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS OF A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.    NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME AND REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.    

The applicable NAICS code is  334511 and the size standard is 750 employees.  This sources sought is in support of market research being conducted by the U.S. Navy as described below.  

To follow is a highlight of the required hardware and services needed for the Navy and attached is a draft Statement of Work (SoW).

The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Air Traffic Control Division, Area Control Systems Branch (NAWC-AD 4.5.8.3) Webster Field Annex is conducting a market survey for the potential procurement of a Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) Identification of Friend or Foe (IFF) surveillance system to support Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) air operations on board the U.S. Army?s Pohakuloa Training Area (PTA) on the big island of Hawaii.  The Airspace to be surveyed is the R-3103 Special Use Airspace, and immediately surrounding airspace.   

Due to environmental, geographical, and cultural concerns, a traditional spinning RADAR/IFF system has been determined to be inappropriate.

At this time, NAWC-AD 4.5.8.3 is assuming that a distributed Multilateration surveillance system is the best approach to satisfy all requirements.

All interested parties should provide published literature for systems submitted in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with the described salient characteristics.     
Interested parties should also indicate if they are a manufacturer or dealer of equipment, what size business they are (small or large), what the standard warranty is, and budgetary estimates for each of the following line items:  1.  Site Preparation,   2.  Mission Equipment,  3.  Power Generation equipment for remote sites,  4.   Installation services,    5.   Testing,    6.  Training,   7.  Spares,   8.  Warranties,   9.  Other Costs (identify any costs that do not fit within line items 1 through 8).

It is expected that at each of the Pre-existing Improved Remote Sites (section 3.5.5.1 of the SOW) some site preparation shall be required.  Each party should specify site preparations that would be required for their equipment.  Examples of site preparation could be (but are not limited to) foundation footers provided and installed, guy wire supports, etc.   If, for example, footers are to be placed, identify building to local code, i.e. A 3 inch thick cement pad, measuring 2 meters by 2 meters, inlaid with 3/8 inch rebar.

Each Party should provide a brief description of how their equipment will comply with section 3.11.5 Equipment Profile.

There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties in support of the effort mentioned above. 

Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit or award a contract.     If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website, located at www.fedbizops.gov.     It is the potential offeror?s responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any follow-on information.     

Interested parties are requested to submit a capabilities statement of no more than 10 pages in length, and demonstrate their ability to provide the requirements listed above.     All data received in response to this sources sought, marked or designated as corporate or proprietary, will be fully protected from release outside the Government.     It is highly encouraged that capability statements be submitted electronically to the designated point of contact in Microsoft Word format or Portable Document Format (PDF) to the following email address: Donald.Mumbert@navy.mil .

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Library, intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order with SWETS INFORMATION SERVICES INC., Runnemede, NJ, for a base period of twelve months and four twelve-month options to extend the term of the contract for use of "ScholarlyStats," a Web-based usage statistics comparison and analysis tool for use by the NIST Library.  The authority for this action is FAR 13.106-1(b).

The NIST Library currently uses the ScholarlyStats application, and it would not be cost effective to replace it with another application.  Also, it is important to NIST that stable access to the Library usage data be maintained.  Finally, NIST does not believe that the duplication of cost to the Government to replace the existing ScholarlyStats application would not be recovered through competition.

NIST is unaware of any other sources besides SWETS INFORMATION SERVICES that can provide a renewal contract for the ScholarlyStats application; however, sources that can satisfy NIST's requirements for ScholarlyStats may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  In so doing, the source shall provide written evidence that they are authorized by SWETS INFORMATION SERVICES INC., to provide the ScholarlyStats services NIST requires.  This notice is not a solicitation, and no solicitation is currently available.  

Inquires will only be accepted via email to sandra.shaffner@nist.gov.  All information received by 10:00 a.m., EST, 12/26/07 will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed acquisition will be based on responses to this notice; such determination is solely within the discretion of the Government.  No telephone requests will be honored.

We are interested in systems that currently support federal government procurement operations.  The IRS presently utilizes a web-based Request Tracking System (webRTS) for all requisitions (procurement and non-procurement) and a web-based Integrated Procurement System (webIPS) which Procurement utilizes to process all awards.  Both webRTS and webIPS interface with IRS? existing SAP financial system.  WebRTS currently supports 20,000 users, and webIPS currently supports 300 users.  In fiscal year 2005, IRS procurement processed 6954 awards and 7261 modifications.  The integrated procurement system shall be able to integrate or interface with existing SAP financial system software.  The system shall be able to interface with or provide requisitioning and electronic catalog capabilities.  The procurement system shall provide functionality that supports the full acquisition life cycle, from requisition preparation through contract completion and close-out.  The system shall support a full array of acquisitions from purchase card through multi-million dollar Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task order contracts.  The system shall accommodate all award types from Firm Fixed Price through Cost Reimbursement.  The system shall contain reporting capabilities, routing logic, and procurement logic.  The system shall be currently implemented at Government sites.

The Northern Region Contracting Center (NRCC) intends to p rocure the following services. The U.S. Army Signal Center, Capabilities Development Integration Directorate, Experimentation Division (EXP) anticipates a requirement for a support contract to provide engineering and analytical support to future force, wir eless and satellite communications experiments, evaluations, assessments and fieldings.   The EXP provides Future Force Experimentation communications support to all TRADOC battle laboratories and proponents; Executes battle command and branch proponent ex perimentation, technology assessments and insertions activities; Operates, manages and maintains the Battle Laboratory Collaborative Simulation Environment/Cross Command Collaborative Environment  Network Operations and Security Center  (BLCSE/3CE NOSC); Supports the operation of the Network Service Center  Training  (NSC-T) to support live force play in exercises, demonstrations and equipment fieldings; Operates and maintains the EXP Wireless Evaluation Laboratory and Experimentation Environment (WELEE) to support the evaluation of wireless technologies.  This anticipated effort includes performing advanced satellite engineering support to include configuration and troubleshooting of FDMA and TDMA satellite communications assets to properly terminate the RF portion of the network.  Likewise, the routing, switching, and voice components of the baseband architecture within the NSC-T will be configured properly to allow connectivity of data and voice services.   Additionally, comprehensive knowledge of techni cal assessment and experimentation procedures for various wireless technologies (i.e. WLAN, PtP/PtMP WWAN, Cellular, Microwave, Free Space Optics, etc. ) to include providing written documents and supporting network design considerations in which emerging commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) wireless  technologies and associated devices (i.e. wireless computers, PDAs, switches, routers (wireless and wired), intrusion detection / prevention software and other devices)can be configured and operated independently o r as an integrated system IAW DoD, Army and Fort Gordon regulations and Information Assurance policies.  Network design considerations must address both the physical areas of the evaluation laboratory located at the EXP facility.  In order to execute this work, the contractor must have International Standards Organization 9000 (ISO 9000) Quality Control certification as well as the Software Engineering Institute Capability Maturity Model (SEI CMM) Level III certification.  Extensive knowledge and experience  supporting a wide range of distributed simulation networks to include installing and maintaining WAN connections, voice-over-IP (VoIP) and video teleconferencing (VTC) devices, routers and data switches, using Government Furnished hardware and software at  both the Network Operations Security Center (NOSC) and the distributed client sites is required.? BLCSE NOSC success relies on strong theoretical engineering background and hands-on configuration skills to maintain local and remote BLCSE WAN connections n ecessary for all distributed TRADOC experimentation.?All EXP, CDID, projects and experiments require Information Assurance and Information Security (IA/IS) technical support.  This includes protecting and defending information and information systems by en suring their availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and non-repudiation with qualified, certified, technical labor.  IA/IS computer science services and certifications are required in accordance with procedures outlined in the directive Interim Department of Defense (DoD) Certification and Accreditation (C&A) Process (DIACAP) Guidance dated July 6, 2006, DoD 5200.40  DoD Information Technolog y Security Certification and Accreditation Process, DoDI 8570.01-M  Information Assurance Workforce Improvement Program and in AR 25-2  Information Assurance., and the Army Best Business Practices.  Finally, this effort will require strong experienc ed tactical signal analytical technical labor to support the  Army Concept and Capability Development Plan (AC2DP), Army Concept Development Experimentation Plan (ACDEP), Signal Corp based Concept Capability Plans (CCP) that drive a campaign of learning, u nderpinning both near- and long-term Army developments; and utilizes the resources of a diverse, DoD-wide Community of Practice (CoP) to develop concepts and conduct experimentation in order to support the development of current and future Modular Force co ncepts and capabilities in support of transformation.  This anticipated effort will support the TRADOC Concept Development Path to assist in developing a concepts-based, coherently joint, future Modular Force.  This will require participation in TRADOC des ignated experiments and exercises to develop, refine, test, demonstrate and analyze tactical communications and network related concepts, architectures and capabilities to reduce risk to soldiers and investments for the future through actionable recommenda tions informing Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) decisions and Program Management (PM) acquisition strategies. <BR><BR>The designated NAICS Code is 517919.

<DESC>A. General Information.  <BR><BR>The Northwest Region (TRBO Region 11) ), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 8 Army, Navy, Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in Washington and Alaska announces a Request for Regional Incen tive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Suction Cannulae and Tubing <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize products or product lines obtaining the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price based on volume pricing discounts utilizing a best value determination process. Standardized products will be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. <BR><BR>The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decrea sing the existing Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.  The below item detail of the products being purchased within the region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensur e the minimum requirements of the Region are met and help identify possible candidates for elimination (i.e. like product items), as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.<BR><BR>The Military Treatme nt Facilities (MTF) in the Northwest Region include but are not limited to: Basset Army Community Hospital, Fort Wainwright, AK 99703; Bremerton Naval Hospital, Bremerton, WA 98312-5000; Fairchild AFB Clinic,Fairchild AFB, WA 99011-8701; 354th Medical Grou p, Eielson Air Force Base, AK 99702;3rd Medical Group, Elmendorf AFB, AK 99506-3620; Madigan Army Medical Center, Tacoma, WA 98431-5000; McChord AFB Clinic, McChord AFB, WA 98438-1150; Oak Harbor Naval Hospital, Oak Harbor, WA 98278-8800<BR><BR>This Region al Incentive Agreement announcement is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have, or be in process of obtaining, a  Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor (Cardinal Health).  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute  their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access our web site at:  https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The agreement will be for a bas e period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods.  Anticipated award date is April 2008.  The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical, and pricing factors.  The selection will be determined utilizing b est value/trade off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Pat Cordier, RN, MSN, CNOR at (253) 968-0898; Email - Patricia.Cordier@us.army.mil<BR><BR>B.

Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board for the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of  the Military Treatment Facilities within the Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.

If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Regions may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit efficient competition among vendors. 14 calendar days from the date of the pricing request will b e allowed for responses in the requested format.<BR><BR>Phase I Plan: Technical/Company Evaluation: Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  <BR><BR>(1) the business concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables.<BR><BR>(2) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or se rvices submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services.<BR><BR>(3) the vendor has or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified).<BR><BR>(4) the vendor has , or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items with Cardinal Health, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified).<BR><BR>(5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified).<BR><BR>(6) the vendors in formation provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR><BR>1.	The sources sought notice will be posted to the FBO for a period of five weeks. Vendors that do not meet the dea dline of Close of Business (COB) 4:00PM PST listed on the FBO for responding to the announcement will be disqualified from further consideration. <BR><BR>2.	Vendors will respond to the FBO announcement by e-mailing their interest in participating in the st andardization process, addressing the technical/company criteria, and providing literature about the products to the POC listed on the announcement.<BR><BR>3.	At the 3 week mark if response has been less than anticipated, all vendors with current usage for  the product line in the Region will be contacted via email. (2 week notice)<BR><BR>4.	The vendors will provide detailed responses to the technical/company criteria. Vendor responses should contain the vendor's best answers to all technical and/or company requirements listed in this announcement. <BR><BR>5.	The TRBO team will compile the technical/company criteria responses and send to the CPT/TPRB for review.<BR><BR>6.	The CPT/TPRB will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet  the criteria and which vendors are disqualified based on their responses to the technical/company criteria.<BR><BR>7.	The vendors who meet the technical/company criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process.<BR><BR ><BR>Technical/Company Criteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/ approved the following equally weighted criteria:   <BR>   <BR>1.	Vendor is required to provide a full line of surgical suction cannulae and tubing.  Please li st the types and brands of cannulae and tubing to include sterile cannula/tubing sets, single packaged sterile cannula (i.e.: Yankauer, Frazier, Poole, uterine vacuum curette, nasogastric, tracheal suction), single packaged sterile tubing, and non-sterile bulk tubing.  Please note that additional requirements may become required items of supply in the future.  Overall a complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/ Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  See DMMonline for the statement of work.<BR><BR>2.	Vendors that do not meet the following criteria will be disqualified:<BR>	 a. Vendor must have a DAPA for this product group (provide DAPA number).<BR>	b. Vendor must have a distribution agreement with Cardinal Health, the regions prime vendor. 	Please acknowledge and identify that you have such an agreement with Cardinal Health .<BR>	c. Vendor must offer committed volume discounts off their DAPA price for this product group.<BR><BR>3.	The vendor must be able to supply non-sterile suction cannulae and tubing to the company that holds the Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) to assem ble custom packs for the region.  Currently, that vendor is Cardinal Health.<BR><BR>4.	Regional Supply Servicing Requirements:  Required elements include a distribution network that allows products to reach the Prime Vendor Distribution Center in sufficien t quantities to meet the regional demand history in a timely manner.  In addition, vendors must also have vendor representation sufficient to provide product implementation services and inservicing to all eight facilities in the region.  Please state your plan for providing the above services. <BR> <BR>5.	Vendors must provide a standard industry warranty, at a minimum, Please provide your companys returned goods  policy. <BR><BR>6.	Detail any history of backorders and/or recalls for this product group.  Please include: (a) Dates and duration, (b) Cause, (c) Resolution. If there is no history of back orders or recalls, so state.<BR><BR>Phase II Plan: Clinical/Perfo rmance Evaluation:<BR><BR>1.	Using their clinical expertise, the CPT will develop a list of items from the product group to evaluate. The determination of the sample set is based on advances in technology and/ or patient safety, and on historical usage for  the product line.<BR><BR>2.	The TRBO office will request a no-charge clinical evaluation sample set from the vendor. The vendor will be required to send the samples directly to the participating MTFs. Vendors who do not meet the deadline for sample arriva l will be disqualified from the standardization process.<BR><BR>3.	The CPT will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will represent a clinical value judgment placed in a Likert-like scale with a 1 to 5 sc oring format (1 = Strongly Disagree; 2 = Disagree or no; 3 = Undecided; 4 = Agree or yes; 5 = Strongly Agree).  Comments will be invited and recorded on the evaluations. The CPT has set a threshold of 3.1 for clinical acceptability for standardization. The  CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.1 depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the clinical acceptability target threshold of 3.1.  Below this threshold, products will be clinically una cceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration for standardization. <BR><BR>4.	Each vendor will provide product literature, training aides and/or teaching material prior to the clinical evaluation for facilities in the Northwest Region.<BR>< BR>5.	Clinical evaluations will be tabulated by the TRBO and results will be forwarded to the CPT/TPRB members in the Northwest Region for review.<BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria: During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/ approved  the following equally weighted criteria: <BR>     <BR>1.	Sterile packaging allows the product to be aseptically delivered to the sterile field.<BR><BR>2.	Product packaging easily identifies whether the item contains latex.<BR><BR>3.	Suction cannulae have non-slip grip in dry, wet, and bloody environments.<BR><BR>4.	Suction cannulae have smooth suction holes, appropriately placed for type of instrument.<BR><BR>5.	Suction cannulae have features appropriate to their surgical function (i.e.: malleable shafts, control vents, etc.)<BR><BR>6.	Connection between cannula, tubing, and suction canister is secure.<BR><BR>7.	Tubing has low coil memory and drapes well.<BR><BR>8.	Tubing withstands a high vacuum pressure without collapsing.<BR><BR>Phase III Plan:  Pricing Analysis: <BR><BR>1.	The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization/ Conversion Costs), (2) Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of SKUs (i.e.  potential for inventory reduction) by each vendor.  Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements. <BR>  <BR>2.	Vendors who meet the clinical accep tability threshold considering the break will be asked to submit pricing for analysis. 14 calendar days from the date of the request will be allowed for responses in the requested format. Those vendors that fail to respond as required will be disqualifie d from consideration. Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process.<BR><BR>3.	The TRBO will conduct a price analysis. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), wit hout discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quot es should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and re quest revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>4.	The p rice analysis will be sent to the Northwest Region TPRB for review. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible (3) three one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).<BR><BR>5.	Technical/ Company and Clinical/Perform ance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical results become more equal, price becomes more important. <BR><BR>6.	The TPRB reviews the data for acceptable performance a nd lowest price quote.<BR><BR>7.	The Designated Senior Logistician (DSL) will ensure that the offered prices in conjunction with the volume purchasing commitment will be a good value considering the operational impact.<BR><BR>8.	The TPRB selects a vendor f or standardization.<BR><BR>9.	The TRBO develops decision document and submits to DSCP for approval.<BR><BR>10.	The RIA is initiated, vendors contacted and TPRB notified.<BR><BR>

Please ema il product literature only to: Pat Cordier, RN, MSN, CNOR at patricia.cordier@us.army.mil<BR><BR>5.	The TRBO will request that vendors send the no cost sample set directly to participating MTFs, the TRBO will provide addresses at that time. <BR><BR>Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the TRBO that its quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  We strongly recommend that each submit ting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for <BR>re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.<BR>	<BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board fo r the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a  vendor or vendor(s), without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or com pany criteria listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing <BR>discounts off the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Northwest Region). Additiona lly, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will  permit efficient competition among vendors. <BR><BR>Phase I Plan: Technical/ Company Evaluation:  <BR><BR>1.	The sources sought notice will be posted to the FBO for a period of five weeks. Vendors that do not meet the deadline of Close of Business (COB) 4 :00PM PST 25 January, 2008 for responding to the announcement will be disqualified from further consideration. Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with th e TRBO point of contact that their response and literature actually arrived at the Region via email. We strongly recommend that vendors confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first tr ansmission. <BR><BR>2.	At the 3 week mark if response has been less than anticipated, all vendors with current usage for the product line in the Region will be contacted via email. (2 week notice, the deadline is still 25 January, 2008)<BR><BR>3.	Vendors r espond to the FBO announcement by e-mail stating their interest in participating in the standardization process, addressing the technical/company criteria, and providing literature about the products to the POC listed on the announcement. <BR><BR>4.	Vendor replies should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company requirements listed in this announcement. <BR><BR>5.	The TRBO team will comp ile the technical/company criteria responses and send to the CPT for review.<BR><BR>6.	The CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and which vendors are disqualified based on their responses to the techn ical/company criteria. Generally, responses to the following criteria demonstrate that: <BR><BR>     1) the vendor offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of Suction Canisters.<BR>     2) based on the vendors responses, the Region has reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services offered meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services. <BR>     3) the vendor has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items. <BR>     4) t he vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal Health, the Prime Vendor for the region. <BR>     5) the vendor offers discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  <BR>     6) the vendors  information provided is factually correct (any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.)<BR><BR>7.	The vendors who meet the technical/company criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performanc e evaluation process.<BR><BR>Technical/Company Criteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/ approved the following equally weighted criteria: <BR>     <BR>1.	Vendor is required to provide a complete line of rigid disposable suc tion canisters and rigid reusable suction canisters with flexible liners.  A 'complete line of product' is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line. 'Usage items' are defined in the medical/ surgical prime <BR>vendor contract s tatement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. The region requires suction systems that have a capacity range from 1000 cc to 16,000 cc.  <BR><BR>Please list the types, brands, and sizes of canisters and l iners available, and list the brackets, rings, and carts that support surgical suction canisters.  Please note that additional requirements may become required items of supply in the future.  <BR><BR>2.	Vendors that do not meet the following criteria will be disqualified:<BR>a. Vendor must have a DAPA for this product group (provide DAPA number).<BR>b. Vendor must have a distribution agreement with Cardinal Health, the regions prime vendor.  Please acknowledge and identify that you have such an agreement w ith Cardinal Health.<BR>c. Vendor must offer committed volume discounts off their DAPA price for this product group.<BR><BR>3.	Regional Supply Servicing Requirements:  Required elements include a distribution network that allows products to reach the Prime  Vendor Distribution Center in sufficient quantities to meet the regional demand history in a timely manner.  In addition, vendors must also have vendor representation sufficient to provide product implementation services and inservicing to all eight facil ities in the region.  Please state your plan for providing the above services.  <BR><BR>4.	Vendors must provide a standard industry warranty, at a minimum, Please provide your companys returned goods policy. <BR><BR>5.	Detail any history of backorders and /or recalls for this product group.  Please include: (a) Dates and duration, (b) Cause, (c) Resolution. If there is no history of back orders or recalls, so state.<BR><BR>Phase II Plan: Clinical/ Performance Evaluation:<BR><BR>1.	Using their clinical exper tise, the CPT will develop a list of items from the product group to evaluate. The determination of the sample set is based on advances in technology and/ or pa tient safety, and on historical usage for the product line.<BR><BR>2.	The TRBO office will request a no charge clinical evaluation sample set from each of the vendors with a required delivery date. Each vendor will send the samples directly to the particip ating MTFs. <BR><BR>Vendors who do not meet the deadline for sample arrival will be disqualified from the standardization process. Due to the potential for samples to become lost, the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the TRBO point of contact that their samples actually arrived at the MTFs via email. We strongly recommend that vendors confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a <BR>problem should occur with the first shipment.<BR><BR>3.	The CPT will evaluat e the product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will represent a clinical value judgment placed in a Likert-like scale with a 1 to 5 scoring format (1 = Strongly Disagree; 2 = Disagree or 'no'; 3 = Undecided; 4 = Agree or 'yes'; 5 = Strongly Agree).  Comments will be invited and recorded on the evaluations. The CPT has set a threshold of 3.1 for clinical acceptability for standardization. The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.1 depending on the 'brea k' in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the clinical acceptability target threshold of 3.1.  Below this threshold, products will be clinically unacceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration for standardization. <BR><BR>4.	Each vendor will provide product literature, training aides and/or teaching material prior to the clinical evaluation for facilities in the Northwest Region<BR><BR>5.	Clinical evaluations will be tabulated by the TRBO and results will be forward ed to the CPT/TPRB members in the Northwest Region for review.<BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria: During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/ approved the following equally weighted criteria:      <BR><BR>1.	Canister system assembles quickly (i.e. easy to separate from the stack, package opens by hand, lid snaps on reliably, ports are marked clearly).  <BR><BR>2.	Canister has an effective automatic shut-off valve or device.<BR><BR>3.	Canister has accurate volume gradations (tested by i nstilling a known and independently-measured quantity of liquid into canister and checking accuracy of gradations). <BR><BR>4.	Canister has easily-readable volume gradations (gradations can be seen at a glance, markings are clear).<BR><BR>5.	Canister confi guration permits safe disposal of fluids as measured by the following features, if applicable to the system configuration: liner separates from canister readily, lid snaps shut and seals securely, lid opens easily for emptying, and mouth is wide enough to instill solidifier or to empty canister or liner, or other features that reduce opportunity for contamination of persons or environment.  <BR><BR>Phase III Plan: Pricing Analysis: <BR><BR>1.	The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis :  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization/ Conversion Costs), (2) Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of SKUs (i.e. potential for inventory reduction) by each vendor.  Due to the potential for Base DAP A prices to be inflated, the impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.  <BR> <BR>2.	Vendors who meet the clinical acceptability threshold considering the 'break' will be asked to submit pricing for analysi s. 14 calendar days from the date of the request will be allowed for responses in the requested format. Vendors that do not meet the deadline and those vendors that fail to respond as <BR>required will be disqualified from consideration. <BR><BR>Due to the  potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the TRBO <BR>point of conta ct that their pricing actually arrived at the Region via email. We strongly recommend that vendors confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission. Vendors that have been di squalified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process.<BR><BR>3.	The TRBO will conduct a price analysis. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain  the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best <BR>tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the tota l requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit  the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>4.	The price analysis will be sent to the Northwest Region TPRB for review. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible (3) three one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).<BR><BR>5.	Clinical/Performance evaluation is more important than the price. As the technical and clinical results become more equal, price becomes more important. <BR><BR>6.	The TPRB revie ws the data for acceptable performance and price analysis.<BR><BR>7.	The Designated Senior Logistician (DSL) will ensure that the offered prices in conjunction with the volume purchasing commitment will be a good value considering the costs associated with  standardization, operational impact, and regional clinical preferences.<BR><BR>8.	The TPRB selects a vendor(s) for standardization.

This is NOT a request for proposal or an invitation for bid.  The intent of this INDUSTRY DAY,17th January 2008 at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) facility Edwards AFB, CA is to obtain market research on the details for the Draft BAA announcement.  Responses will not be considered as proposals and no award will be made as a result of this synopsis.  Information will be released in sections.  Therefore, entities who wish to participate in this market research should maintain an awareness of announcements on Federal Business Opportunities (http://www.fedbizopps.gov/).  Only U.S. contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC), Federal Center, Battle Creek, Michigan 49017-3084 (800-352-3572) that have a legitimate business purpose or who are teamed with one of the registered contractors need attend.  Interested contractors may request an informal meeting to discuss these attendance requirements.  Attendees registered with the DLSC, must submit a copy of the approved DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, and a visit request to Ms. Crystal Klemmer (661-275-5109) a minimum of one week prior to Industry Day.  Industry Day Purpose and Objectives: 
The following presents the program area of interest for which AFRL is initiating efforts to develop new or enhanced technologies.  The program area is focused on the functional or business area that directly corresponds to the mission of the Propulsion Directorate (RZ), Space and Missile Propulsion Division (RZS), Engines Branch (RZSE).  The Third Generation Reusable Boost (3GRB) program is to investigate innovative concepts to achieve IHPRPT Phase III Hydrocarbon boost goals in addition to responsive launch goals for a reusable liquid rocket engine system.  This advanced technology program will be focused on developing technology advancements to achieve IHPRPT Phase III Hydrocarbon Boost goals including responsive launch and reusability goals.  The government defined goals are for a liquid rocket engine system which produces a percent improvement in relation to the IHPRPT hydrocarbon boost baseline engine.  The 3GRB goals are a 17% increase in mission average specific impulse (Isp), 100% increase in effective thrust to weight (T/W), 35% decrease in production cost, 75% reduction in failure rate and a defined number of cycles for mean time between removal (MTBR).  The goals also include a defined number of cycles for mean time between overhaul (MTBO), a limit for the amount of time required to turn-around the engine and a defined throttle range.  The 3GRB goals shall be demonstrated utilizing liquid oxygen (per MIL-PRF-25508F) as the oxidizer and Liquid Methane (per MIL-PRF-32207) as the fuel.  AFRL is particularly interested in novel technologies and cycles and program approaches that will ensure program success while meeting or exceeding all goals.  The program is intended to provide AFRL with the most cost effective schedule to obtain goal achievement validation to eliminate or reduce new technology risks.

<SUBJECT>19 -- Request For Information - Combatant Craft, Medium (CCM)
<DESC>Reference: RFI-CCPMO-NGCC dated 21 June 2007, provided a description of a next generation combatant craft for US Special Operations Command.  The requirements have been refined and an acquisition program is anticipated that will surpass existing 11M Naval Special Warfare Rigid Inflatable Boat (NSW RIB) capabilities and performance.  This new program is hereinafter referred as the Combatant Craft, Medium (CCM).  The following information provides the refined requirements for this craft.

Description: The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Combatant Craft Program Management Office is conducting this industry survey to determine available contractor base for the design/build of the Special Operations Combatant Craft, Medium (CCM).  Special Operations Forces (SOF) requires a tactically sized, highly reliable, reconfigurable, combatant craft capable of operating from land or maritime platforms.  The primary mission of CCM will be to provide for insertion/extraction of SOF into hostile/denied littoral/coastal areas as well as to provide tactical surface mobility for visit, board, search, and seizure (VBSS) operations.

General Note: The terms threshold and objective are used throughout this document.  Threshold is defined as the minimum acceptable operational value.  Objective is defined as the desired operational value beyond which any gain in utility does not warrant additional expenditure.  

Program Timeline/Strategy: Draft RFP to follow in 4th Qtr calendar year 2008.  Expect Formal RFP release in 1st Qtr calendar year 2009. Multiple contract awards for prototype fabrication and testing planned in 4th Qtr calendar year 2009.  The number of awards is contingent upon receipt of acceptable contractor proposals and available funding.  Results of testing will be used to select a single contractor for CCM production and logistic support.  Projected production is for 24 craft over a three to four year period. Selected contractor(s) will be required to deliver a prototype CCM for government testing 12 months after contract award.

Craft Requirements:
The craft on trailer shall be capable of air transport in C-130, and capable of airdrop from C-17.  
	Principal Characteristics are estimated to be: LOA 43 ft, Beam 8.75 ft, Height (on trailer) 8.5 ft.

Total weight of craft shall not exceed 20,500 pounds (Threshold equals Objective).
Total weight of the craft is the sum of: lightship craft, fuel, and variable payload. 

Craft variable payload shall be at least 4,500 pounds (Threshold) and 7,750 pounds (Objective).  Craft variable load includes four (4) crew with personal combat gear (allocate 1000 lbs), nine (9) combat-equipped SOF personnel (allocate 2500 lbs), and mission equipment (allocate 1000 lbs).
 
Cruise speed shall be at least 40 knots (Threshold) in 4 foot combined seas.
The cruise speed objective value is 55 knots in 6 foot combined seas.   

Range, at specified cruise speed, shall not be less than 270 nm (Threshold) in 4 foot combined seas. The range objective value at specified cruise speed, is 330 nm in 6 foot combined seas.

Sprint speed:  Responders may provide predicted sprint speed, in 3 foot combined seas and sustained for 30-minutes, at designated total craft weight.     

CCM will be a highly maneuverable craft and should include steering, +/- bow trim, and throttle response.  

CCM seakeeping vertical acceleration requirement at the specified cruise condition should not exceed 1.05g (RMS). CCM design will incorporate shape, form, and function specifically intended to counter the physical stress, strain, shock and vibration energies imparted to the crew and passenger personnel.  Human exposure for accumulated spine stress dose (Sed) normalized to an 8 hour exposure should not exceed 4.7Mpa (Threshold) and 3.9Mpa (Objective).  Eight hour operating profile may include as many as 5 hours at the specified cruise condition (40kts in 4ft combined seas).  Human exposure limits Sed8 values should be based on ISO 2631 Part 5 Health Hazard Assessment for Repeated Impacts.  Additional human exposure information may be provided with the RFP. 

Responders should propose a modular remote stabilized weapon system.  The system should be capable of effectively engaging a surface target at 1 kilometer and should have a coverage of 300 degrees arc of fire.  The weight of this module will be a  component of the variable payload.

CCM shall encompass both low detectability and low vulnerability. CCM requires a total-craft approach to balance high performance attributes with other survivability attributes.  The optimum balance of the CCM craft attributes will satisfy power and performance requirements as well as specific requirements that will be called out later in a classified attachment to the RFP.  These requirements will cover the areas of radar, infra-red (thermal) detectability of the craft with passengers and equipment in place. 

Responders are alerted now that they must meet facility and personnel security clearance requirements for handling and storage of classified material up to SECRET level in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program (NISP) in order to be granted access at the time of RFP release to this classified attachment. 

Contractor designs should provide an open-architecture electronics system that integrates craft controls, navigation, propulsion systems monitoring equipment, government-furnished tactical communications equipment, FLIR, remote stabilized weapon, and potentially a commercial satcom communications system.  

A government-furnished tactical communications equipment package may require additional space and weight provisions independent of typical console mounted equipments.  Estimate 10 cubic feet and 150 lbs for this package.  This weight will be a part of lightship. 

Contractor designs should provide for clear, unobstructed topsides to minimize damage. Elimination of traditional electronics/antenna masts will reduce maintenance.  Designs should incorporate use of conformal and low profile antennas where possible.  Estimate thirty (30) square feet of available topsides area populated with conformal or low profile antennas.

Government furnished electronics suite and antennae information will be detailed in the RFP.  In response to this RFI, please indicate your experience and capability to integrate low profile antennae to optimize communications system performance.

Mean time between operational mission failures (MTBOMF) Threshold for the total CCM system shall not be less than 49 hours.  MTBOMF Objective is 104 hours.   Reliability metric exists such that the failure free operation of the following equipments/systems combined must not cause a mission failure: Hull and Structure, Main Engines, Transmissions, Propulsor, Driveshafts and Steering/Trim system, Alternator/ voltage regulators, Engine starters, Integrated control/monitoring system, Navigation  system, Human Shock mitigating system.  

CCM service life is projected at 7 years.  The government will require government purpose license rights along with production drawings of the top-side arrangements and components.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
                                                    Commandant (G-A)

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

Current OTI country programs include: Colombia, Lebanon, Liberia, Nepal, Pakistan, Somalia, Sudan, Venezuela, and West Bank/Gaza. OTI country programs are designed and managed in Washington, with substantial input and oversight from field-based staff.  OTI annually operates ten to twelve country programs on three continents with an average budget of $100 million and 90 staff in Washington and in the field.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled employees make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.

OTI's Field Programs Division (FPD) develops, oversees, and manages OTI country programs and field staff that includes all programming responsibilities and authorities, and start-up and close out of OTI country programs. FPD staff regularly engage with counterparts in USAID Missions overseas, Regional Bureaus, Department of State, and other offices engaged in country development issues. The FPD provides expertise and technical support for country programs and USAID Missions, and represents OTI in intra/inter-agency sector-specific dialog and debate.

INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this contract is to hire a Regional Team Leader to lead one of USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (DCHA/OTI) regional teams in the management of existing country programs and conduct new country program assessments as the need arises.  OTI currently has three regional teams within the Field Programs Division: Africa (AFR), Asia and Near East (ANE), and Latin America and Caribbean (LAC). Under this solicitation, the Regional Team Leader is initially expected to manage the ANE team. This is a program-funded USPSC position, which OTI anticipates will focus the vast majority of time on country program implementation.

OBJECTIVE

The objectives for this position are to (1) ensure USAID/DCHA/OTI's regional team is managed effectively in Washington and the field (effectively manage and supervise OTI Program Manager staff in Washington, and OTI Country Representatives in the field), and (2) ensure US government funds are spent wisely, in coordination with other key actors, and in a manner that reflects OTI standard practice, and USG policy.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

The Regional Team Leader will be based in Washington and will report to the OTI's Chief of Field Programs Division or his/her designee. The Regional Team Leader's principal responsibility will be the oversight and management of specific DCHA/OTI country programs in one of OTI's three geographic regions. The initial assignment for this position will be with the Asia and Near East (ANE) Team.  

The Regional Team Leader must be an individual with sound judgment, excellent communication, interpersonal and analytical skills and possess a well-developed understanding of US policy interests. The successful candidate must have a strong interest in assisting countries in transition and be able to accomplish a wide range of assignments on short notice. Since work may require continual changes in program direction and implementation, including frequent coordination, the individual will be someone who is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change. Further, it is important for the Regional Team Leader to be experienced in managing all aspects of transition program operations in order to mentor program staff, and ensure that all processes and procedures are being followed so that program implementation is undertaken efficiently and effectively.

The incumbent must demonstrate creativity, excellent communications, leadership and analytical skills, and the ability to operate with high levels of autonomy, responsibility, and authority, while exercising sound judgment in politically charged situations. The candidate must be mature, self-reliant, a team player as well as a leader, and a problem-solver. S/he will have management experience, and understand budgeting and financial management. The successful candidate will be able to communicate effectively with grassroots organizations and their constituencies, national and local government officials, USG agencies, other donor and international governments, the United Nations, and other international organizations, and experience working for, or closely with, USAID or another USG office in the field. S/he must also be able to work efficiently and effectively in a bureaucracy where frequent changes may occur.  

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES  	

The incumbent serves as OTI's principal expert on country program issues related to the region of assignment. A majority of the duties listed below are related to management and supervision of program funded personal, and the development, oversight, and management of OTI's country programs. It is important that the Regional Team Leader quickly familiarize her/himself in the key tasks of the country team members in order to ensure that primary tasks are carried out appropriately and efficiently.

The Regional Team Leader's duties will include but not be limited to:

* Lead and manage the Regional Team in Washington headquarters, including the management and supervision of Program Manager staff in Washington and Country Representatives in the field, as well as Implementing Partner grants and agreements at the headquarter level. (Note that OTI Country Representatives in the field directly supervise additional field staff, and responsibility for managing implementing partners at the headquarter level may be delegated to trained Program Manager staff in Washington.);

* Design staffing plans to meet overall program objectives, ensure staff work objectives and tasks are well defined, and ensure recruitment is initiated immediately when staffing needs arise. Ensure staff are highly qualified and trained and mentored in all critical aspects of OTI operations and programming. Ensure employee performance evaluations are completed in a timely manner in accordance with OTI office policy; 

* Negotiate, oversee and manage the overall Regional Team country budgets and ensure the Regional Team procurement plan is kept up to date.

* Conceptualize and design, in close coordination with lower and higher-ranking USAID and other U.S. Government officials, OTI country program strategies and determine appropriate USAID funding levels and requirements;

* Oversee and ensure the development of documentation for any required program contracts, grants or cooperative agreements;

* Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with NGOs, international donors, Department of State and other USG agencies and others interested in particular OTI country programs;

* Coordinate and communicate with other DCHA, USAID, State Department, Department of Defense and other U.S. Government agency personnel in Washington and the field; cooperating country Government officials; United Nations organizations; the World Bank; and host country and international NGOs;

* Monitor and evaluate OTI country programs through regular communication with the OTI program staff and implementing partner headquarter staff, the regular review of reports from the field and Washington, liaising with the OTI Program Office team, and regular field site visits;

* Ensure that field programs are provided support, when needed, as an auxiliary team member in the field;

* Oversee, develop and/or manage, in conjunction with the OTI Washington staff and OTI country representative in the field, an OTI close-out strategy that will, wherever appropriate and possible, ensure reasonable and effective hand-over to follow-on USAID and/or other donor programs;

* Serve as a central participant on inter- and intra-agency policy and crisis task forces when required;

* Disseminate regular DCHA/OTI reports to U.S. Government and non-U.S. Government agencies and organizations as deemed appropriate;

* When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as acting Chief of Field Programs Division, or Country Representative in the field in his/her absence, for example;  

* Mentor other OTI Team Leaders, and mentor and train Country Representatives and Program Managers as required; and,

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.  

DCHA/OTI's Operations and Management Division in Washington provides OTI with an advanced level of operational and management support to help ensure ongoing and improved flexible, rapid response in political transition programming overseas. The Operations and Management Division is responsible for instituting and maintaining office-wide systems and processes, office practices and procedures, and the creation of an enhanced response capability through teamwork, responsiveness, fiscal responsibility, quality control, and customer service. The Division supports a majority program-funded workforce in the areas of administrative support, financial management of OTI program funds, human resource assistance for program-funded personnel, information and technology operations and programmatic support for Washington and the field, and procurement tracking of OTI program-funded activities.

Within the Operations and Management Division, the Information and Technology Team (IT Team) is responsible for analyzing needs, developing solutions, and advising on issues related to business process and information management. The IT team regularly participates in core DCHA/OTI process design, development and training exercises.  The goal of the IT team is to create and maintain an enhanced response capability to support information management and effective processes for OTI field and Washington teams. The team accomplishes this through analyzing business process and information management needs in order to institute and maintain office-wide systems, processes, practices and procedures that support the overall mission of the office as well as address the needs of individual teams.  

Program and Operations staff work as a team to ensure country programs are started, managed, and closed efficiently and effectively.   

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

INTRODUCTION

The incumbent serves as the Program Manager for Information and Technology (IT), reporting to the Technology Specialist (IT Team Leader) or his/her designee, in the Office of Transition Initiatives (DCHA/OTI).  

The Program Manager for IT supports DCHA/OTI's Senior Leadership, the three other divisions of DCHA/OTI (the Field Programs Division, Program Office Team, Operations and Management Division), and all field programs (under the Field Programs Division) with responsibility in the areas of information systems (such as systems analysis and database design), and in program management (such as backstopping support for field teams and reporting).  

The incumbent has a direct role in both the operations and the program activities of DCHA/OTI, learning from both in order to develop more effective systems and processes. The incumbent will, as needed, serve as an integral part of the DCHA/OTI country program activities as well as develop and maintain the systems that individuals in those program roles will use. This involves short-term assignments to backstop or assist Program Managers and others in the country program team or Operations team when required in order to better understand the existing business processes, information flows, and types of data managed. This analysis should lead to the development of improved information system tools supporting the program.  

The incumbent will gain a deep understanding of OTI's operational and programmatic goals and combine this knowledge with a strong background in information technology to provide consultation on the development of OTI's information systems.

OTI uses a Microsoft Access database to track and report on country program small grants and other activities. The database system gives OTI an ability to manage and explain to others a diverse portfolio of OTI activities in many countries. The incumbent will: provide support to OTI and Implementing Partner staff overseas as well as Washington-based staff; create enhancements to the program and ensure that the system maintains consistency with the program strategies and structures in each OTI country; and support and review the processes inherent in program management that maintain information flow to OTI managers, partners and stakeholders.

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this solicitation is to hire a Program Manager for Information and Technology to support OTI staff and programs.

These systems may include: operational and programmatic information systems such as personnel, inventory, scheduling, annual reports; communication and collaboration tools such as websites, email tools, file sharing tools; programmatic tactical technology solutions such as PDA solutions, wireless and web-based systems. The incumbent will undertake special projects in pursuit of these process assessments that will include assignments evaluating existing program roles that are key to OTI business processes.  

* Special projects will include short-term assignments that involve requirements analysis accomplished in part through performance of business processes such as those listed below in order to assess appropriate changes to OTI information management systems, or adjustments to program processes that will result in improved program performance and effectiveness:

Applicable documents 2.1.	None 3.	REQUIREMENTS 3.1.	The contractor shall develop a project plan that details the  requirements of an explosives press analyzer for ARDEC building 236.  This  plan would include specifications for meeting safety requirements, connection  of the instrumented press to existing press control sensors, and the  identification of critical quality measurements desired by ARDEC.    Visits to  ARDEC will be used to gather information and develop the specifications. 3.2.	The contractor shall design and deliver an instrumented press (die and  rams) system that meets the safety requirements of a large-billet, explosives  press located at ARDEC Building 236 press room. This first instrumented press  will be used to optimize the system for material property measurement and  defect characterization in a large 4-6 inch press.   The system shall include  an instrumented die and rams as well as the electronic systems to continually  monitor the ultrasonic press sensors.  The electronic systems will be  integrated with existing ARDEC press controls and sensors. 3.3.	The contractor shall develop a calibration for the instrument and  validate the instrument for several explosive materials.  The calibration  shall allow the ultrasonic readings to be converted to average density  readings at multiple locations along the billet.  These density readings will  be used to validate the numerical models being developed for the compaction  of these billets. 3.4.	The contractor shall modify the sensor design and provide a second  instrument with improved sensing of the compacted powders.  The improved  design may include additional sensing paths through the pressed powders, or  additional modes of sensing the compaction.   Demonstrate that the real-time  outputs from the analyzer can be used for process control of press  manufacturing operations. 3.5.	The contractor shall provide on-site training of ARDEC press personnel  on the final, improved system.  By working with ARDEC personnel during  extensive press testing, the contractor shall determine the best type of  operator interface to provide quality control information to the press  operators.  To allow for on-site training and press analyzer evaluation, ASI  personnel shall travel frequently to the ARDEC press facilities in Picatinny,  NJ.  Specific travel dates are shown in the schedule provided. 4.	DELIVERABLES  4.1.	 The contractor shall deliver a Project plan delivered six weeks from  date of award. 4.2.

This requirement is being issued to enhance existing hardware.  It is needed in support of MDAýs mission: Develop and field an integrated BMDS capable of providing a layered defense for the homeland, deployed forces, friends, and allies against ballistic missiles of all ranges in all phases of flight.  The Missile Defense Agencyýs mission is to develop, test, and prepare for deployment a missile defense system. Using complementary interceptors, land, sea, and air space based sensors, and battle management command and control systems, the planned missile defense system will be able to engage all classes and ranges of ballistic missile threats.  Our programmatic strategy is to develop, rigorously test, and continuously evaluate production, deployment and operational alternatives for the ballistic missile defense system.  Missile defense systems being developed and tested by MDA are primarily based on hit-to-kill technology.  IT has been described as hitting a bullet with a bullet ý a capability that has been successfully demonstrated in test after test.  No other software exists that affords the capability.  Hitachi hardware has been adopted by MDAýs program and this interface is the only one that will work with this existing hardware architecture.  Any other type of support will add extra costs of an additional hardware interface. There is only one responsible hardware product and no other support will satisfy the agencyýs requirements because of equipment requirements. Failure to provide this single type of hardware support will have a significant adverse effect on the programýs mission.<BR><BR>

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

ATTACHMENT 2

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-12
HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

FAR Clause 52.204-9	Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

As prescribed in 4.1301, insert the following clause: 
Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Nov. 2006) 
(a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, as amended, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, as amended.
(b) The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. 
(End of clause)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) (September 2006)

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems.  USAID will begin issuing HSPS-12 "smart card" IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach.  Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new "smart card" IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems.  USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007.  (Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to October 27, 2007.  In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.)

Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC* or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo.  One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.)  USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer.  Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAID's information systems.  All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing.  The contractor or his/her Facility Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.

The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPS-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures.  This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/W and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office.

In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and the later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the most recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer.

The contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-12
HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

FAR Clause 52.204-9	Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

As prescribed in 4.1301, insert the following clause: 
Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Nov. 2006) 
(a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, as amended, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, as amended.
(b) The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. 
(End of clause)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) (September 2006)

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems.  USAID will begin issuing HSPS-12 "smart card" IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach.  Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new "smart card" IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems.  USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007.  (Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to October 27, 2007.  In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.)

Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC* or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo.  One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.)  USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer.  Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAID's information systems.  All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing.  The contractor or his/her Facility Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.

The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPS-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures.  This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/W and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office.

In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and the later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the most recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer.

The contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems.

<SOLNBR>VA-258-08-RQ-0015
<RESPDATE>122107
<ARCHDATE>01202008
<CONTACT>TAZ BELCHER
<DESC>1.  Q.  Please clarify the time frame.  The start and work of a 24 hour period or less depending on the man hours needed even if it is at night?      A.  Historically, when we performed the inventory we did both Inpatient and Outpatient Rx on the same day that being Saturday. On Sunday, we did the SEEC and NWEC. It would be ideal if the contracted inventory company could do all three sites the same day - Saturday starting in the morning say 6:30- 7:30 and finishing by 4 or 5 pm. We plan to have a VA pharmacy employee at all three sites to handle questions from the inventory team. The inventory of all the sites should not take more than 9-10 hours to complete-max. We would prefer not to work during the night 2.  Q.  Are there estimated levels available for an accurate pricing for the RFP?      A.  Previous years inventory levels at the various sites:                               	                                      March 2006      March 2007            Outpatient Pharmacy        525,549.89      702,659.88             Inpatient Pharmacy          478,489.93      413,318.68             Northwest Ext. Clinic       39,167.60       22,383.88              Southeast Ext. Clinic       58,357.26       24,048.82 3. Q.  In our experience with the VAMC's, even though the RFP states that the facility will count the Narcotics and then give the counts to be entered to the inventory service, we have actually taken inventory of Narcotics for the VAMC with their presence.  For this RFP, will this be allowed, or will the Pharmacy count the Narcotics.     A.  Pharmacy management will inventory the Narcotics at all sites. These numbers will be turned over to the inventory team to included in the final inventory reports. 4.  Q.  Will the pharmacy staff be able to have the item #/NDC available on the products if none are present?  Or will the staff give us the information when we find these items without proper identification?     A.  One Procurement team member will be present at each site to assist inventory team members with questions on NDC numbers or any other areas of concern. 5.  Q.  The Robot Cannisters or Autoscripts, many times the items in the cannisters do not have NDC's/Item numbers labeled nor will they be counted by the pharmacy staff.  We have usually counted and research these items on our own since the staff is minimal on weekends? Would this be allowed or will the staff have this ready prior to our arrival?     A.  Medications contained in any robotic devices will be inventoried by pharmacy staff. 6.  Q.  Has a contract been previously awarded for this service?  If so, who won the award and what was the award amount?      A.  Previous contracts have not been awarded for this service. Previous inventories were performed by pharmacy staff members from each area. 7.  Q.  You have listed four pharmacy locations.  What is the approximate size of each? Can you please provide the estimated inventory/quantity on site for each?     A.  Approx. sizes of each area: Most accurate inventory figures for each site are shown in question #2 March 2007.               Outpatient Pharmacy  7,000-8,000 sq.ft                Inpatient  Pharmacy  2,000-3,000 sq.ft                Northwest Ext. Clinic  200-300 sq. ft                Southeast Ext. Clinic  1,000 - 2,000 sq ft. 8.  Q.  Are you requiring the prime contractor to hold a valid DEA Registrant license?      A.  We are not requiring the prime contractor to hold a valid DEA registrant license. 9.  Q.  In leu of a site visit, can you provide a map of each existing site set up, per location,regarding inventory/storage?     A.  A site visit prior to inventory will be required. I would like to meet management members of the inventory company to discuss our specific needs and concerns with inventory issues and to go over physical layout of each site. In addition, we expect the inventory company to report inventory data using Mckesson VA information/pricing. In the past we had a bad experience with a potential vendor who was not able to get their software to load Mckesson information. Random inventory tests proved a failure. Vendor was not hired and pharmacy personnel ended up doing inventory at the last minute. We do not want to repeat this again. All systems will need to be tested prior to actual inventory event.

Quotations must be signed, dated, and received by the closing date and ti me, via fax at 410-306-3726 or email at susan.sowa@us.army.mil at the US Army Contracting Agency, Directorate of Contracting, Attention: SFCA-NR-APC-T, 4118 Susquehanna Avenue, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005-3013.

Please SUBMIT YOUR QUOTATIONS to Ms. Sowa via email to:  susan.sowa@us.army.m il or Fax 410-306-3726.  Note the following change in the W91ZLK-08-T-0083 Specifications:  Revise hazardous location classifications to Class 1, Group C, D, and Class II, Group E, F, G, Division 2 for conditioned chamber area wiring specifications.   QUES TIONS AND ANSWERS ARE AS FOLLOWS CLIN 0001: QUESTION 6: The Cargocaire HC-300 would have to be XP as well, air would be circulated through it from inside the chamber.  We are checking in to this on our end but wondered if this was taken in to consideration  and if you had experience buying XP Cargocaire units in this model? Answer: The air drier does not need to be explosion proof. The HC-300 is located in mechanical area of chamber. To make clear the safety specifications of the chamber, please be advise of  the following: 1. Any openings in the wall between the conditioned chamber area and the mechanical equipment area shall be sealed so that no conditioned air may leak into the mechanical area. Openings in this wall must be sealed from both sides. 2. The ex plosion proof interior light fixtures apply only to the conditioned chamber area. 3. Regarding the seven 120V, 20A duplex receptacles, three will be located in the mechanical equipment area and four will be located on the exterior walls of the conditioned chamber area. The four receptacles shall be located near the access ports. All receptacles shall be clear of any door swing areas/clearances. 4. Revise hazardous location classifications to Class 1, Group C, D, and Class II, Group E, F, G, Division 2 for c onditioned chamber area wiring. QUESTION 7: How large do the bi-parting doors need to be? Answer: The bi-parting doors should open up to allow full access to the interior conditioned space, 94 wide x 122 deep x 83 high.  QUESTION 8: A 15x15 Cascade refr igeration system (as specified) will not transition this size chamber from 180?F to -80?F in 120 minutes with a 3000 lb load of steel especially with 3/16 th plate in the bottom of the chamber for the floor. Answer: We are requesting the 15hp refrigeration  system. Three hours will be sufficient for the temperature/load limits. QUESTION 9: I do not see a mention to blow out panels which would be typical on this type of chamber? Answer:  The chamber does require blow out panels. QUESTION 10: Requirement for d efrost?  Do you plan on soaking at a low temperature for a prolonged period of time?  Answer: A defrosts system is being requested. The chamber could soak at low temperatures for as long as a month. Sometimes it may only run for a week. However, people may  enter the chamber on humid days bringing moisture into the air. QUESTION 11: Can we quote our standard control system or is the Micristar controls system a must? Answer: The Micristar control system is a must. QUESTION 12: Is a Modular panel room ok? Answ er: If referring to the chamber wall construction, it must be well sealed. The chamber will not be moved once installed. However, leakage can be a problem so any short cuts in the chamber wall construction could mean a large loss of quality for the chamber  in its future. <BR><BR><BR>
