<DESC>The 2008 United States Air Force (USAF) Marathon is Saturday, September 20 at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio with a two day Sports & Fitness Exposition (September 18-19) and 5K race (September 19) at the E. J. Nutter Center, Wright State University. All events are open to the public.  The mission of the USAF Marathon is to provide an outstanding running event that is fun, yet challenging for competitors of all fitness levels; providing the highest military standards of customer service in collaboration with our sponsors and surrounding community partners.  The USAF Marathon delivers the ?Race with a Different Altitude,? highlighting U.S. Air Force aircraft flyovers and a finish line flanked with vintage aircraft.  The USAF Marathon maintains it?s uniqueness by having Air Force Senior Leadership present each runner with a commemorative medal as they cross the finish line. 

	For the past two years we have increased our runner registrations at a rate of 25% per year. Our goal is to continue this trend until we reach 10,000 runners to become a World Class Marathon event.  In 2007 our runners represented 49 states and 10 foreign countries with more than 6,700 registered runners and about 15,000 attending the Sports & Fitness Expo.  Furthermore, this year we implemented our first ?Down Range? marathon which included deployed service men and women in places such as Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Kyrgyzstan. This gives our sponsors a unique opportunity to connect with a large and global market. 

	Our professional staff is happy to work with your company or organization to reach your marketing goals and budgets and to receive the maximum return on your investment. Thank you for your consideration.

<DESC>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to enter into a contract to support advanced development of new or improved influenza virus diagnostic laboratory test systems that meet U.S. regulatory requirements for use in U.S. clinical laboratories.  Products for influenza virus testing should have high sensitivity and specificity, along with reliability, capability for testing larger numbers of specimens with reduced tech time, reasonable cost, and flexibility to run single or multiple assays (to include assays for specific influenza A subtypes) on the same specimen and quickly adapt to testing for new pandemic virus candidates, or subtypes.
These tests should have capability to detect all influenza A viruses and differentiate novel from seasonal influenza viruses and other human respiratory viruses.  Proposals for multi-marker or individual assays, methods and platforms that may meet inter-pandemic and pandemic testing scenarios will be considered.  Besides meeting or exceeding the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity performance of currently used laboratory-based diagnostic tests (primarily viral culture and IFA/DFA), the laboratory influenza diagnostic test system is expected to enable an increased number of specimens that can be tested in medium and large hospital, academic hospital, and commercial laboratories with reduced hands-on time.  In addition, instrument purchase price, footprint and per assay costs are important considerations for practical use and implementation.  The final objective of this contract is to have a new or improved FDA approved laboratory diagnostic test system for use in U.S. clinical laboratories within 2-3 years that meets the criteria noted above.  The contractor will provide all labor, materials, and equipment required to achieve the above mentioned objectives.  Incremental funding for a cost-reimbursement type contract will be provided to support this effort.  A pre-proposal meeting/conference will be held prior to the due date for the receipt of proposals.  The date, time, and location for the preproposal meeting will be included in the solicitation.  RFP 2007-N-09247 will be available on or about June 1, 2007.  The solicitation can be accessed through the internet at: www.fbo.gov.  Any amendments issued to the solicitation will also be made available at the same website.  It is the Contractor?s responsibility to keep up with additional postings regarding this RFP on the FedBizOpps website.  Full and open competition will be used in soliciting offers for this requirement.  This procurement will not be set-aside for small business.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the Agency.  Any questions/concerns about the subject RFP shall be submitted via e-mail to Jeff Miller at afx2@cdc.gov.

<DESC>The 708th Armament Systems Group (708 ARSG), 308th Armament Systems Wing (ARSW), Eglin AFB, FL plans an acquisition for a Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD) of a Hard Target Void Sensing Fuze System (HTVSF), a cockpit programmable system that will provide multi-delay arming and detonation as well as void sensing functions for a BLU-113 or BLU-109 weapon to penetrate and destroy hardened targets protected by multiple layers of reinforced material.  Additional technical details are available on FedBizOps (www.fbo.gov) under Industry Day notifications posted on 11 July 2007 and 28 August 2007.  Two contractors will be selected for award of separate JCTD contracts to design, test, and demonstrate the capabilities of each of their proposed HTVSF systems to meet the requirements specified in the System Requirements Document.  The SRD is available on FedBizOps under Industry Day Notification - Hard Target Void Sensing Fuze System, HTVSF Draft Documents, posted 19 July 2007.  During a planned 27 month period of performance, the two JCTD contractors will be evaluated against predetermined evaluation criteria, and one will be selected to deliver 20 residual HTVSF JCTD assets and to be awarded a follow-on System Demonstration and Development (SDD) contract.  The single SDD contractor is expected to receive a sole-source follow-on production contract award for production of the HTVSF.  Pending a final determination regarding foreign source participation, the Government anticipates awarding one JCTD contract under full and open competition and the other under a competition restricted to U.S. sources only; although, the Government reserves the right to pursue a Small Business Set-Aside.  THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR AN INVITATION FOR BID AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.  Responses to this synopsis will be considered with respect to the contractor?s capabilities to meet the HTVSF requirements for JCTD and potential follow-on SDD and production contracts; however, responders will not be provided the results of the Government assessment of their qualifying packages.  Responses to this synopsis should be submitted for receipt by the Government within 15 days of the publication date and must state whether the potential source is a small business concern IAW FAR 52.219-1.  The NAICS Code/Size Standard are 332995/500 employees.  Interested firms must have secret level security clearance.  For technical information on this synopsis, contact Major Corey Harris, (850) 882-8787, ext. 2204 or Michael Bowen, (850) 882-8787, ext. 3266.  Collect call will not be accepted.

<SUBJECT>R -- Support Which Implements Fast Transition III (SWIFT III)
<SOLNBR>M-OAA-DCHA-OTI-08-033
<CONTACT>Cristina Sylvia, Contract Administrator, Phone 202-712-5566, Fax 202-216-3132, Email csylvia@usaid.gov - Michael Clark, Contract Officer, Phone 202-712-1323, Fax 202-216-3134, Email mclark@usaid.gov
<DESC>The U. S. Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to negotiate and award multiple Indefinite Quantity Contracts (IQCs) for Support Which Implements Fast Transition III (SWIFT III). 

Contract(s) resulting from this RFP will be of the indefinite quantity contract (IQC) cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) type awards. Subject to the availability of funds, USAID estimates awarding up to seven contracts, including up to six unrestricted and up to one set-aside for a small business, on the condition that firms are capable of undertaking the work.  There is no guarantee on the number of contracts awarded or the number of orders that any one firm will receive beyond the minimum stated in the RFP. USAID anticipates that the maximum ordering limitation of the contracts resulting from this RFP will be $1,500,000,000 over the five (5) year ordering period. Note that this ceiling applies across all contracts and cannot be exceeded in the aggregate.

The objective of this IQC is to provide the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) with the means to support U.S. foreign policy objectives by helping local partners advance peace and democracy in priority countries in crisis. Through specific task orders, the contractor will establish, staff, manage, operate, and support a flexible quick-response mechanism capable of administering and implementing targeted activities. The OTI program's country team, comprising OTI and contractor personnel, will work on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key political transition and stabilization needs. 

Since 1994, OTI, part of USAID's Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA), has laid the foundation for long-term development in 34 countries in transition by: nurturing peace processes; promoting reconciliation; supporting independent media; developing strategic communications capacities for nascent democratic governments; and fostering peace and democracy through innovative programming. In countries undergoing a transition from authoritarianism to democracy, violent conflict to peace, or other pivotal political events, OTI seizes windows of opportunity and seeks to act as a catalyst for positive political change. OTI programs are short-term, typically, two to three years in duration. OTI programs often are initiated in states that have not reached the stability needed for longer-term development to succeed. Therefore, OTI works closely with USAID regional bureaus, Missions, and other counterparts to identify programs that complement other assistance efforts and lay a foundation for longer-term development after OTI exits. 

OTI programs are designed to meet the unique needs of each country context and to remain responsive to rapidly evolving political and operational environments. In order to fulfill its mandate OTI must have the ability to change, reorient or refocus its programs in order to rapidly respond to new strategic opportunities in the country or region. Previous OTI programs in the past have:

Drawn people together across ethnic, political party, and religious lines to work towards common goals; 
Provided materials for small infrastructure repair projects as a means of encouraging communities to hold government officials responsible for responding to local priorities;
Supported community initiatives to rehabilitate critical infrastructure in war torn areas;
Facilitated sustained communication and cooperation between newly elected officials and their constituents;
Provided basic furniture, equipment, and short term technical assistance to key government ministries to rapidly restore critical services;
Back local human rights groups and war crimes investigations;
Supported production and development of get-out-the vote ads, local anticorruption campaigns, and public service announcements;
Supported or advanced media infrastructure, systems, networks, regulatory regimes, and professionalism;
Promoted independent media and increased access to balanced information;
Assisted local peacemakers to prevent conflict and promote ethnic reconciliation; 
Provided community-focused reintegration assistance for ex-combatants and war-affected youth;
Provided timely and targeted support to civil society organizations as a means of engaging government officials in dialogue and promoting accountability; and
Supported local efforts to mitigate and manage ethnic and religious conflict through training, improved communication, and confidence-building measures.

More information on OTI, including details on past and present country programs, can be found at http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/index.html or by visiting www.usaid.gov and entering the keyword "OTI".

The successful contractor(s) shall be responsible for all of the programmatic, management, and administrative aspects of the country-specific transition program under the strategic direction of the OTI Country Representative (generally a field-based U.S. Personal Services Contractor, PSC). The contractor's programmatic responsibilities include: conducting continuous political analysis in cooperation with OTI personnel; finding and working with traditional and non-traditional local partners; implementing activities; monitoring the implementation and evaluating the impact of activities; and reporting on progress against program objectives. Activities are anticipated to primarily be small grants under contract (GUC), the majority of which will be issued in-kind.

Local partners who receive these small grants are often non-traditional USAID partners and may include local indigenous groups; cooperatives; associations; informal groups; non-governmental organizations (NGO's); local, regional and national governments; private voluntary organizations (PVO's); U.S. organizations; student groups; media; international organizations; private sector and coalitions of these entities.

The successful contractor(s) shall be responsible for all logistics, procurement, personnel, management, and finance aspects of the program. These include, but are not limited to mobilizing rapidly; hiring and training staff; setting up offices; establishing logistics systems to support in-kind procurement; establishing and maintaining security and emergency systems; purchasing office equipment and vehicles; establishing communications and information systems; developing and maintaining procurement and financial systems; and providing varying amounts of funds on short notice (which has historically been up to $1.8 million for operations and activities) in countries where there are no or limited banking institutions. Contractors will be working in an environment where they will have to overcome significant challenges, destroyed or damaged infrastructures, lack of security, restricted movement of U.S. citizens, scarcity or lack of banking and currency exchange institutions, and the lack of adequate communication services.

Prospective prime contractor(s) must have relevant international experience providing the kinds of services described in this synopsis in countries experiencing political transitions and/or in post conflict environments.

<DESC>The USAID Sri Lanka conflict response program will utilize a variety of programmatic tools to respond to the escalating
conflict in the country. The statement of work requires the contractor to implement an integrated strategy, both within the
variety of elements of the SCRP program and in coordination with the USAID mission?s CORE program issued by its economic growth program ? Request for Proposal (RFP). Program coordination should not be viewed as a utopian goal, often discussed but rarely achieved. All relevant material for both solicitations may be found at http://www.usaid.gov/in/
under the ?Working with us? sublink.
The SCR program will support two areas identified by the United States Government?s (USG) Foreign Assistance Framework: (a) Peace and Security and (b) Governing Justly and Democratically. The program under the peace and security objective will address conflict mitigation and reconciliation elements and the Governing Justly and Democratically objective will address the following elements: Rule of Law and Human Rights, Local Government and
Decentralization, Civil Society and Media.
The statement of work has compartmentalized the Foreign Assistance Framework into four activity areas: human rights,
local governance, conflict mitigation and reconciliation and media. The four activity areas will engage with populations
that are most at risk, with a regional emphasis in the North Central and Eastern Provinces. However, many conflict
response strategies in the regions must be complemented with activities with a national focus.

Individual one-on-one sessions will be held with prime teams following the opening session.  Attendance for one-on-one sessions will be limited to ten people per team.

AGENDA AND SEATING

Discussion areas for this two day event are divided into two sessions.  

Session 1 
Date: Wednesday, 7 Nov 2007 (Morning)
Discussion Topic: Self Awareness Space Situational Awareness briefings (Secret/NF)
Attendance: Limited to maximum three (3) persons per company; All interested companies/division and organizations
The presentation topics will include but are not limited to the following:
	An introductory synopsis outlining the intention to provide an architecture enabling the standard interface for multiple sensors (i.e. Radar Warning, Laser Warning, Optical, Proximity, etc) and multiple interface options to a spacecraft.
	The notional operations concept for the system.
	The expected technical and acquisition strategy for the system in order to exploit critical industry discoveries, innovations and technical solutions.  This will include a discussion of the block acquisition strategy approach. 
	The need for further industry participation in identifying possible sensor designs for near- and long-term implementation along with other potential SASSA improvements.   

Session 2
Date: Wednesday, 7 Nov 2007 (Afternoon)  Thursday, 8 Nov 2007 (All day)
Discussion Topic: Individual Sessions (Secret/NF)
Attendance: Sessions limited to interested prime contractor teams 

Individual Sessions will be held with prime contractor teams for the development of the combined common interface unit (CIU) and TBD sensor(s).  Perspective prime contractors may sign-up for a 30 minute individual one-on-one slots during the RSVP process. (Note: Individual Session times are dependent on the number of prime contractor teams in attendance.)   The one-on-one sessions may be lengthened or shortened based on the number of responses received.

PROGRAM OVERVIEW:  The goal of these sessions is to provide a full understanding of SYSW?s desire to equip the warfighter with solutions to detect, characterize, attribute and geo-locate threats/attacks against blue space assets.  The SASSA program will address these needs using a block acquisition approach.  SASSA will be a modular and flexible, space-based payload architecture supporting multi-sensor threat warning interoperability in all orbit regimes.  The system architecture will include a centralized processing, data handling, data storage and power distribution capability.  This Common Interface Unit (CIU) will provide an interface to the host spacecraft and to a suite of sensors that provide environmental/threat indications and warnings. The CIU will have multiple interface options to the spacecraft in order to account for various interfaces found on current spacecraft.  A non-proprietary standard interface between the sensors and the CIU will be established either by the government team or through industry proposal.  SYSW is planning to use the CIU and a tailored sensor complement on future US spacecraft for localized space situational awareness (SSA).  In addition to the CIU, SYSW will acquire sensors adhering to the non-proprietary CIU interface standard to be part of the Block 10 system (e.g. Radar Warning Receiver, Laser Warning Receiver, Optical Sensors, Proximity Sensor, etc.).  SYSW anticipates awarding at least one contract to a prime contractor who will develop the CIU and TBD sensor(s) and will be responsible for integration of all current and future sensors.  In future block upgrades, the CIU will remain the interface enabler allowing the inclusion of new/improved sensors and capabilities (e.g. stand-alone communication).  The initial phase of SASSA will be conducted at the Secret collateral level.  

In order to perform this effort, contractors should have extensive knowledge of spacecraft command & data handling, data manipulation & processing (including data fusion), spacecraft sensor development, integration & testing, along with on-orbit operations experience.  At industry day, participants will be invited to submit white papers outlining current or future IRAD work on any of the topics presented in this announcement.  Attendance by small business and small, disadvantaged business firms is highly encouraged.

The appropriate small business standards are North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541712  Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology), with a size of 1000 employees.

<DESC>This is a notice from the Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division to issue a Firm Fixed Price Simplified Acquisition Purchase (SAP) Order, on an other than full and open competition basis, to WIPL-D, d.o.o., Bulevar Mihajla Pupina 10E/I apt. 132, 11070 Novi, Belgrade, Serbia.  This order is for the purchase of the following:

1.	WIPL-D Pro - upgrade to v6.4 for 5 licenses
2.	WIPL-D Optimizer - upgrade to v3.5 for 5 licenses

The above licenses are for a uniquely designed computer code that is not available from other vendors.  The code uses the method of moments, and handles wires and patches simultaneously, and with great efficiency.  It has its own graphical interface and many other critical features that we seek in a computational electromagnetics code.  WIPL-D runs using unique hardware keys that are specific to the software, which the software recognizes upon opening.  Having five (5) licenses, all used quite heavily by NAVAIR-455 engineers at all times, this upgrade would be 100% compatable with what already exists to serve the Navy.  

Any contractor believing they ahave a product that can meet these minimum requirements should send a capabilities statement to the individual identified below.  The Contracting Specialist shall consider any responses to the synopsis.  For information or questions regarding this notice, please contact Mr. Blake Strickland at (301) 757-9737,

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to enter into a contract to support advanced development of new or improved influenza virus diagnostic laboratory test systems that meet U.S. regulatory requirements for use in U.S. clinical laboratories.  Products for influenza virus testing should have high sensitivity and specificity, along with reliability, capability for testing larger numbers of specimens with reduced tech time, reasonable cost, and flexibility to run single or multiple assays (to include assays for specific influenza A subtypes) on the same specimen and quickly adapt to testing for new pandemic virus candidates, or subtypes.
These tests should have capability to detect all influenza A viruses and differentiate novel from seasonal influenza viruses and other human respiratory viruses.  Proposals for multi-marker or individual assays, methods and platforms that may meet inter-pandemic and pandemic testing scenarios will be considered.  Besides meeting or exceeding the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity performance of currently used laboratory-based diagnostic tests (primarily viral culture and IFA/DFA), the laboratory influenza diagnostic test system is expected to enable an increased number of specimens that can be tested in medium and large hospital, academic hospital, and commercial laboratories with reduced hands-on time.  In addition, instrument purchase price, footprint and per assay costs are important considerations for practical use and implementation.  The final objective of this contract is to have a new or improved FDA approved laboratory diagnostic test system for use in U.S. clinical laboratories within 2-3 years that meets the criteria noted above.  The contractor will provide all labor, materials, and equipment required to achieve the above mentioned objectives.  Incremental funding for a cost-reimbursement type contract will be provided to support this effort.  A pre-proposal meeting/conference will be held prior to the due date for the receipt of proposals.  The date, time, and location for the preproposal meeting will be included in the solicitation.  RFP 2007-N-09247 will be available on or about June 1, 2007.  The solicitation can be accessed through the internet at: www.fbo.gov.  Any amendments issued to the solicitation will also be made available at the same website.  It is the Contractor?s responsibility to keep up with additional postings regarding this RFP on the FedBizOpps website.  Full and open competition will be used in soliciting offers for this requirement.  This procurement will not be set-aside for small business.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the Agency.  Any questions/concerns about the subject RFP shall be submitted via e-mail to Jeff Miller at afx2@cdc.gov.  MODIFICATION: Solicitation 2007-N-09247 will be issued on or about October 16, 2007.  A preproposal conference will be held at the CDC in Atlanta, Georgia on or about November 6, 2007.  This requirement is now going to be administerd by Ms. Lisa Brown (770-488-2646  tdc0@cdc.gov).  Proposals will be due on or about November 30, 2007.  Any questions/concerns about the subject RFP shall be submitted by e-mail to Lisa Brown and Jeff Miller (afx2@cdc.gov).

<DESC>BAA 07-18 Amendment 2

NOTE:  BAA07-18 Amendment 2 will remain open for 60 days after this amendment is published to allow proposers to address the specific Complex System Architectures (CSA) topic area.  Proposals responding to the CSA topic received after the 60 days may not be evaluated.

The Complex System Architectures (CSA) effort seeks to exploit how an understanding of the architecture of complex systems can be applied to benefit a broad array of U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) problems and the larger US National interest.  A particular area of interest to MTO is identification of the optimal architectures needed to design complex Microsystems.  MTO would like to utilize the techniques and strategies employed by various technical disciplines (mathematics, biology, network design, systems engineering, electrical engineering, etc) in developing these architectures to create the most effective future Microsystems technologies.  Ideally a measurable system, widely applicable across all domains, would allow for future technological systems to be optimized for factors such as efficiency, power, and robustness.  
 
Engineering complicated technologies requires tradeoffs to be made in order to maximize efficiency for a given application.  These compromises often result in a system useful within a small scope and lacking in robustness.  Many natural ("non-engineered") complex systems tend to be remarkably efficient and robust, often exploiting adaptive elements to self-correct or re-optimize.  These natural systems are often highly interconnected and may be highly dependent on diverse states of the various parts of the system.  MTO is interested in identifying fundamental principles found in the architectures of natural systems and applying them to engineered Microsystems technologies.

To this end, the goal of CSA is to formalize design, development, and testing methodologies that can concurrently shorten system development cycles while increasing overall confidence and robustness of system performance.  While theoretical investigations are intended as an integral part of the CSA program, it is also expected that studies develop computer simulations and/or hardware test beds to prove out the conclusions developed in such investigations.  

This amendment solicits inputs for short-term (3-6 month, 1 to 2 man year) studies to further define the underpinnings of CSA and define opportunities for future MTO program initiatives.  Potential areas of interest include:

Ultra-low power system-on-chip design

Multi-element non-linear simulation

Robust, variation tolerant, mixed signal design/architectures

Effective multi-domain optimization strategies for complex optimized architecture designs

Reconfigurable and self-reconfiguring microsystems

Adaptive, highly resource efficient, algorithms for generalized signal analysis, organization of high-dimensional data, and context-aware information exploitation

Specifically excluded are evolutionary approaches based on conventional strategies to optimize Microsystems in these topical areas.

Proposals must highlight the applicability of the proposed work to CSA system challenges.  Advances are needed to identify quantifiable metrics for analysis of complex system behavior.  Investigations of novel CSA architectures should show the potential effectiveness to a specific problem or problems of interest to MTO.   The deliverables should be designed such that relevant study results can be shared with the CSA community to fuel discussion and help generate new ideas.  Proposals should include a clear program plan, regular milestones and metrics.  

Proposal will be evaluated as they are received with an initial funding selection anticipated  60 days after this amendment is published.

Dr Dennis Healy, dennis.healy@darpa.mil , is the primary technical POC for this amendment.

<RESPDATE>122807
<ARCHDATE>02262008
<CONTACT>Sally Duncan, 309/782-8018
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to reopen solicitation, DAAE20-02-R-0193, to augment the award pools established for full & open competition and small business concerns in Segments 1-5 to promote additional competition and production capacity.  The solicitation, originally issued on September 13, 2002, is for the procurement of various Sets, Kits and Outfits and may be referred to as the SKO solicitation. The term sets, kits, and outfits collectively refers to a wide variety of tools and equipment us ed to support the Army's tactical and combat support weapon systems and its Ordnance and Combat missions.  This amendment may result in the award of multiple contracts to expire concurrently with the existing award pool contracts.  A contract under a particular segment will give the awardee the opportunity to compete for future requirements in that Segment.  Th is amendment will not result in the award of a delivery order for any of the sample requirements.   We are soliciting proposals from both large and small businesses.  Delivery Orders will be competed in accordance with the fair opportunity to compete provisions set forth in the original solicitation  DAAE20-02-R-0193 https://aais.ria.army.mil/aais/padds _web/DAAE2002R0193/0000.pdf.  The award of a contract is not a guarantee that an order will be placed against that contract.  The award only signifies that the awardee is eligible to compete for delivery orders pursuant to the fair opportunity to compete provisions.  We will use the co ntracts, consistent with the fair opportunity to compete provisions, to fulfill its SKO requirements unless otherwise exempted by law or regulation. In order to promote competition this requirement was divided into the following segments in the original solicitation: Segment 1 Mechanical Maintenance Tool Kits:  An assemblage of mostly hand tools used by automotive, aircraft, and equipment mechanics, and others in the mechanical trades for performing field maintenance and repair.  The kit is transported to its place of final use in a single person or multi-person carry tool container.  These kits are go-to-war items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. Segment 2 Construction/Engineer Tool Kits:  An assemblage of mostly hand tools, including powered hand tools, primarily used in the construction trades to perform construction and repair of facilities, power lines, etc.; transported to its place of final u  se in a single person or multi-person carry tool container.  These kits are go-to-war items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. Segment 3 Specialized Tool Kits:  Assemblages of hand tools, measuring tools and equipment, or special-purpose tools and equipment used to perform a specific mission not normally associated with mechanical maintenance or building trades.  These kits may be  housed in a single or multiple hand carry containers.  These kits are go-to-war items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. Segment 4 Containerized Shop Sets:  An assemblage of tools and machinery used to perform field tasks (maintenance, repair, assembly, disassembly, disabling, adjustment, testing, etc.) on equipment or field construction, transported to its place of use as a  unit in a container or shelter, which is considered to be part of the mobile shop set.  Usually some of the components of a mobile shop may be permanently mounted to the container or shelter by mounting bolts or other fasteners.  These sets are go-to-war items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. Segment 5 Vehicle/Trailer Mounted Shop Sets: An assemblage of tools and machinery used to perform field maintenance or field construction, transported to its place of use as a unit in a purpose-built vehicle body or trailer, which is considered to be part of the shop set.  Usually some of the components of the shop se t a re permanently mounted to its carrier by mounting bolts or other fasteners.  These sets are go-to-war items used by the military in the battlefield to carry wartime operations. Segments 1-5 will be individually competed and awarded under this amendment.  The Army intends to augment, or add to, the award pools already established for each segment:  one under full and open competition and the other for small business concerns.  As stated in the original solicitation, the Government reserves the right to augment the award pools from time to time to promote additional competition or to secure production capacity concerns. Offerors may submit proposals for one or more of Segments 1-5 in accordance with the Section L Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Offerors in this amendment. Each segment shall require offerors to submit a technical proposal (All Segments), past perf ormance proposal (All Segments) and Small Business Participation (Segments 1-4) based on the sample requirement that was used to create the award pools under the original solicitation.  The sample for each of the segments is as follows:   	Segment 1:  Small Arms Repairman Tool Kit          Segment 2:  Engineer Construction Carpenter Tool Kit; 	Segment 3:  Explosive Ordnance Disposal Tool Kit; Segment 4:  Set, Standard Automotive Tool  	Segment 5:  Shop Equipment Welder These DFPs are located on our open solicitation page as Attachments 001, 003, 005, 008, and 0012. Offers will be evaluated in accordance with the Section entitled Evaluation Factors for Award included in this amendment. Contract clauses that will be applicable to resulting award pool contracts will be included in this amendment. Contractors that are awarded contracts to get into the SKO Segments are expected to respond to our RFPs and bid on at least 25% of the items within the Segment.  Points of Contact: Brian Knutson, brian.knutson1@us.army.mil  Segments 1-3  Sally Duncan, sally.a.duncan@us.army.mil   Segments 4-5 Jodi Jefferis, jodi.k.jefferis@us.army.mil Segments 4-5   Vendors wishing an electronic copy may download it on or after the issue date by accessing the following address via the internet: https://aais.ria.army.mil/aais/SOLINFO/index.htm. CAUTION: This solicitation will be issued electronically as will any amendm ents thereto. Because of this, the Government is under no obligation and is in fact unable to maintain a bidders mailing list.  It is therefore incumbent upon any interested parties to periodically access the above internet address in order to obtain any amendments which may be issued. Failure to obtain any said amendments and to respond to them prior to the date and time set for bid opening/receipt of proposals may render your bid or proposal non-responsive and result in the rejection of same.

If you have any questions, you can contact the new acting program manager,  Mike Byorni (michael.byorni@wpafb.af.mil). DRAFT SRD Info (23 Aug 07): Attached is the draft System Requirements Document (SRD) for the T-38C  Improved Brake System Program (IBSP).  We will be having a telecon on  Wed - 5 Sep 07, from 1400 to 1500 (2-3 pm EST) to answer questions and  address any concerns on the SOO or SRD.  The toll-free dial in number is  888-381-5770 and the Participant Code is 39205. We are requesting that you  submit written questions by Fri - 31 Aug 07, to Ms Karen Shelley.  We will  record each question submitted prior to the telecon anonymously as a  "Contractor Question," and if possible, we will address each question  during the telecon.  If time allows, additional questions will be fielded  during the telecon, and if possible a real-time "Government Answer."  In  the event we need to conduct further research, the answer will be included  in a follow-on PIXS posting that records each "Contractor Question" and  the "Government Answer."   Again, if possible, please send your questions  in advance to the Contract Negotiator (karen.shelley@wpafb.af.mil).  The  toll number for foreign companies is 1-210-839-8503 and please use the  above Participant Code. DRAFT SOO Info (17 Aug 07): The attached draft IBSP Statement of Objectives (SOO) is being released  for Industry comment. In the next two weeks we will also be releasing the  draft System Requirement Document, a draft Section M and a draft Section L  for Industry comment.   Please send written comments to Ms Karen Shelley  (Karen.Shelley@wpafb.af.mil) and in the r-mail subject line please add the  name of the document to which the comments refer (EX:  SOO - Comments,  SRD - Comments). Be advised, that it is likely that the complete DRFP release will be  delayed until Sep and RFP release not until Oct.  If you have any  questions, you can contact the acting program manager, George Sarmiento,  at his new e-mail address:  george.sarmiento2@wpafb.af.mil or myself. Additional Information (29 Jun 07): T-38C Improved Braking System Program (IBSP) Drawings Available Upon  Request The drawings referenced in section two of the wheel and brake notional  system/testing baseline for the T-38C IBSP are now available.  To request  a copy, please email Karen Shelley at Karen.Shelley@wpafb.af.mil. Addition Information (29 Jun 07): The attached questions and answers were taken from Panel Discussions at  T-38C IBSP Industry Days on 12 Jun 07. Addition Information: The attached performance specifications were developed during a two year  risk reduction activity.  These performance specifications define key  envelope information, desired system performance and testing requirements.  The attached specifications are provided as a baseline reference to aid in  the development and qualification of your proposed design.  In the  interest of best value, potential offerors are encouraged to review and  propose any improvements and/or modifications to the performance  specifications. 1.  The intent of this Request For Information (RFI) is to develop a  better understanding of technologies available and resources required to  incorporate an improved braking system on the T-38C aircraft.  The overall requirement  for the T-38 Improved Brake System Program (IBSP) is to upgrade USAF Air Education  Training Command's fleet of 453 T-38C and 3 AFMC T-38C aircraft.  Although not  finalized, it is possible that this requirement will be expanded to include both the US  Navy Test Pilot School’s 10 T-38C aircraft and the 31 T-38N aircraft operated by  NASA. The upgraded system shall include the addition of anti-skid capability;  replacement of the current wheel, brake, master cylinders, and other system components  (as necessary); appropriate updates to all aircraft training devices and  technical manuals; necessary on and off aircraft test equipment, any  required studies and analyses and all associated integration issues; and interim contractor  support until fielding is complete.  The IBSP is intended to improve performance, reliability, maintainability and aircraft safety.  More specifically, the modification shall: - Increase braking performance enabling a 13,500 pound aircraft to  accelerate to take off speed with 60% flaps and subsequently stop safely on the  remaining space of an 8000 foot runway (45 degrees C, 1500' pressure  altitude) - Prevent wheel skid, and or lockup; keep wheel speed below tread adhesion  limit; provide protection from hydroplaning. - Prevent wheel brakes from being applied until wheels are up to speed - Provide fault detection and cockpit annunciation - Shall not add main landing gear vibrations during takeoff, landing or  ground operations. - Shall not cause loss of all braking if brake control fails. - Extend brake service life to at least 450 flight hours (current service  life is less than 200) - Not reduce current Mission Capable rates of aircraft - Not increase Maintenance Man Hours (MMH) per flying hour more than 1% - Not increase tire change time over 5 additional minutes 2. The IBSP acquisition approach is anticipated to be a competitive  solicitation with the intent of utilizing a non-development approach to the greatest  extent possible.  The selected contractor will assume all responsibility for  development, testing and integration of the proposed system. The anticipated  acquisition may include up to two years of development and a six-year ordering period with  variable quantity bands and a “most probable quantity".  The Government currently anticipates a production and installation rate of six (6) to seven (7)  shipsets per month (72 - 84 per year). The quantity bands will need to be structured  with suitable flexibility to accelerate or decelerate the rate of production to accommodate fluctuations in funding.  It is anticipated that IBSP  modification kits will be installed by contractor field teams. 3.  This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does  not constitute a solicitation.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), a response to this notice is not an offer  and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract.  Responders are  solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this  RFI. 4. Contractors interested in responding to the request shall provide  answers to the attached questions in the order indicated below and provide  any additional information to this office by COB 9 Feb 07. Please send correspondence to Attn: Capt Brandon Ledbetter, Program Manager (937) 904-4162 e-mail brandon.ledbetter@wpafb.af.mil or Mr. George Sarmiento, Program Manager (937) 904-4307, george.sarmiento@wpafb.af.mil   Please limit your response  to no more than 10 single-sided 8 ½ x 11 pages, double-spaced, minimum 12 point  font size. 1 Attachment RFI Questions Attachment 1 RFI Questions 1.	Describe your present technical capability and past aircraft-specific history of meeting similar requirements. 2.	Describe in some detail your company’s proposed approach for meeting  this requirement. 3.	Identify any commercial item solutions that your company will  incorporate into proposed design. 4.	Identify any non-developmental solutions currently used on military aircraft that your company will incorporate into proposed design. 5.	Describe what portion of the proposed work will be accomplished  in-house versus subcontracting. 6.	Describe the technical risk and problem areas for this requirement, including any anticipated interfaces/technical inputs required to  implement a (system) solution. 7.	Provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate and timeline (proposed schedule) of major milestones. 8.	Describe proposed support approach 9.	State the size of your business and indicate whether you are a small business.

<DESC>Candidate Tracker System

Amendment 001.  The purpose of this amendment is to clarify that the Government is only seeking sources at this time.  Responding to the sources sought does will not bind the Vendor to performance or the Government to a contract.  

Clarification on Quantity.  It is unclear at this time how many systems will be required to conduct the test.  It is our belief, on preliminary research that 20 units would provide the test results sought due to the fact that we are looking at having up to 400 systems working at the same time.  We need to find out what kind of reports or manpower it is going to take to operate and digest the information that one system produces.  However, this market research may show that we can conduct an assessment with 5 to10 systems.  That determination will be made when we know what is available in the commercial marketplace.

Clarification on Length of Test. It is the Government's intent to test the systems for a minimum of 14 days.  One week during land navigation and one week during long range over varying terrain.  Systems will be required to be delivered and activated a minimum of 2 days prior to the exercise to allow for familiarization and training.

Sources Sought

The US Army Special Operations Command (USASOC), John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School (JFKSWC), Fort Bragg, North Carolina, is seeking capabilities and commercial availability of Candidate Tracker Systems.  The Special Forces Assessment and Selection (SFAS) section is considering employing a system to track, record movement, alert, and retrieve candidates during individual training in a wooded environment.  

Requirement - The minimum requirements of the system include but are not limited to the following elements:

1) Tracking and Recording.  The system should be capable of portraying an eight-digit UTM grid location (or equivalent) of all candidates individually, plus or minus 15 meters in point accuracy, that discretely identifies each candidate.  This information must be displayed graphically to a company operations cell with a programmable update rate ranging from every 30 seconds to every 30 minutes.  Service must allow for a blanket coverage (tracking) of the Fort Bragg Northern Training Area, Hoffman Training Area, and Camp Mackall Training Area.  System must provide or be compatible with a graphical display capable of overlay on Ft. Bragg imagery and commercial maps.  System must be capable of future expansion to include tracking of all candidates in 1st SWTG (A) courses, at various CONUS locations, without transmission interference between groups at various locations.  System must NOT provide candidate user UTM grid coordinates or any other location information (without logging a record of the access to the information).  The system must not allow any candidate-to-candidate communications and must not allow the candidate to identify his location.  Cadre must have the ability to graphically show the route traveled, time traveled, and time spent at certain location immediately upon Endex.  The record of an individual candidate's movement during an event must be exportable as a JPEG and as data (ie. distance traveled, time stopped, time moving, etc) this data should be available at any time during or after a training event.

2) Transmission and Power.  System must be able to pass information between stations 6 miles straight line distance apart over exercise terrain.  System charge should be able to operate continuously for up to 18 hours at 30 second intervals and have a recharge capability of eight hours or less.

3) Durability.  System must be durable enough to be able to withstand impact of 100 lbs stopped within three inches, dropped from a height of six feet and be able to withstand submersion down to three meters for an indefinite period (allowing operation once recovered from water).  System must be survivable in extreme weather conditions associated with the Ft. Bragg and Camp Mackall area (ie. precipitation falling at a rate of one inch per hour for a 10-hour period and temperatures ranging from -10 to 120 degrees F).

4) Technical and Training Support.  System must include responsive end user support and maintenance, including 24/7 technical support to operations center and initial train-the-trainer support.  Maintenance turn-around time and mean time between system failures must not reduce the number of working systems below the number of candidates.  Examples of maintenance requirements include but not limited to:  Initial on-site training, updates of mapping software, and repair and/or replacement of inoperable units under commercial warranty.

5) Desired Features.  Emergency and Distress Capability.  The device carried by the candidates and cadre should be capable of alerting the company operations cell when:  a) a candidate is injured and a panic button is pushed; b) a candidate fails to move for a period of 60 minutes; c) a candidate leaves a predetermined area (boundary), and finally the company operations cell needs to have the capability to broadcast an emergency signal (audible alarm) to all candidates simultaneously to alert to impending extreme weather conditions.  

Sources Sought Instructions - USASOC is interested in locating sources for and possibly contracting with vendors who are currently using the most advanced technologies in the design and use of these items.  After review of technical information, the Government may acquire for testing purposes several vendors' products.  Those vendors proposing products that appear to meet the Government's requirements will be asked to send 20 systems each to be tested for one full class.  The vendor shall be willing to provide the equipment for review at no cost to the Government.  No cost agreements will be established to cover the product review time frame which will not exceed 30 days.  Equipment will be evaluated for suitability as tracking and locating devices and will be returned to the vendor.  This evaluation will be used to determine cost and performance trade-offs for hardware/software associated with these devices.  

A written response with complete technical information is requested of those suppliers who can provide working hardware ready for test and demonstration purposes.  Responses to this notice are due on or before 29 Oct 07 and shall include a complete product description with performance parameters and a statement regarding current availability.  Other technical information that may be considered beneficial in the technical review includes but is not limited to the following:  indication of the technology readiness level or maturity of the technology, summary of prior testing, test reports, summary of logistic and maintenance requirements, and  an estimated cost for the units.   Priority for consideration will be given to small businesses.  In the event a suitable number of small businesses respond, large businesses may not be contacted for product review.

Please provide name of firm, address, POC, phone/fax number, and email address.  Submit item information to USASOC Contracting Office, ATTN: AOCO (Barbara Bowles), 1 Desert Storm Drive, Bldg. E-2929, Fort Bragg, NC, 28310.  E-mail responses are encouraged and may be provided to bowlesb@soc.mil.  Due to the intermittent nature of electronic communication, it is the vendor?s responsibility to ensure receipt.  All questions must be provided in writing.  This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Quotation, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to issue an order or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Funds are not currently available for this requirement.

Future Acquisition Possibilities:  If it is determined that commercial capability exists and use of a tracking system is in the best interest of the Government, the Government will issue a solicitation identifying the system requirements that are found to meet the need.  It is estimated that a total of 460 individual tracking devices will be required to meet the Government?s end requirement with a possibility for some growth in quantities.

<DESC>PDA-184 USB RADIO INTERFACE CABLE

The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) located at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida intends to contract directly with SeaLevel Systems, Inc., 155 Technology Place (PO Box 830), Liberty, South Carolina 29657.  USSOCOM has a requirement for five (5) different SeaLevel Systems, Inc. Universal Serial Bus (USB) to Synchronous Serial Adapter Radio Interface Cables.  Each cable will be used to connect either a military laptop, or a personal digital assistants (PDAs), etc. to one of the following four (4) radios: the AN/ARC-231, AN/PRC-117F, AN/PRC-148 and the AN/PRC-150 to transfer data from one to the other.  This data transfer requires a SeaLevel proprietary synchronous driver (permits normal commercial protocols and MILITARY-STANDARD ?frameless? transmissions) to interface between the respective cables? hardware and PDA-184 (a Government developed software application compliant with MIL-STD-188-184).

Each five-foot long ruggedized cable and their interface adapter (AWM E101344 style 20276 VW-1 Space Shuttle-D) will use militarized connectors that mate a Synchronous Serial Interface adapter and one of the following four connectors: (1) MIL connector Part Number: MS27473T18B32S which mates to the AN/ARC-231 Red input/output (I/O) (J3) data/auxiliary jack/port and its backshell, Part Number: M85049/49-2S18W; (2) connector; Harris Part Number 11093-0601-03 which mates to the AN/PRC-117F data/auxiliary jack/port; (3) connector Thales Part Number 1100628-501 which mates to the AN/PRC-148 data/auxiliary jack/port or the Joint Enhanced MBITR; (4) connector Harris Part Number 11093-0601-03 which mates to the AN/PRC-150 data/auxiliary jack/port, (5) a male DB-25 connector which can be mated to any radio?s data/auxiliary jack/port if the radio has data cable with a corresponding female DB-25 connector.  The cable and synchronous interface assembly use MIL connectors for the USB and Serial interface connections that provide strain relief.  A SeaLevel proprietary printed circuit board (PCB) is enclosed in a ruggedized over molded enclosure (sometimes known as a bump-in-the cable) that provides a high degree of resistance to impact, vibration, moisture, and dust.  The cable and PCB are designed as one integrated unit to provide durability and performance at the lightest weight possible.

The PCB, cable and driver operate without the loss of bit count integrity at all rates supported by the radio.  The radio interface to the PCB could be any of the following: RS-232, RS-422, RS-485, RS-530, RS-530A, or V.35.  The SeaLevel Systems, Inc PCB, cables, MIL Connectors, and associated driver software (proprietary to SeaLevel) are the only known product that meets these requirements and are qualified by the Government to work with MIL-STD-188-184 software.  Each cable sought in this synopsis will be fully compatible with each other and with the SeaLevel 3612-2099, 5102, 9064 and 9065 synchronous serial interface adapters currently in use by USSOCOM and DISA.  No other products are known that could perform the above functions.  SeaLevel hardware and driver software were exclusively used during Compliance and Certification testing of the PDA-184 software via dedicated SATCOM, DAMA SATCOM and LOS using SINCGARS, and Have Quick

Project Description:  Please Note:  The description denoted below is a summary of anticipated services and is not intended to be all-inclusive.   Please see http://www.irs.gov/opportunities/procurement/article/0,,id=125378,00.html
For Attachment 1, entitled, ?DRAFT ? Statement of Work (SOW)?.  
 
This is a FY 2008 action. The primary objective of the Government?s requirement will encompass focusing on expanding the use of electronic payment methods to collect federal tax payments and encouraging taxpayers to use electronic media to interact with the IRS.  The IRS is seeking to expand the electronic payments initiative through additional partnerships with private industry. To this end, the Government is interested in awarding contract/s that will increase the number of electronically filed balance due returns and other taxpayer forms and related payments.  We are looking for ways to build upon and expand this initiative to improve service for balance due filers who e-file and to attract others to the program.  Expansion shall include payment methods that do not require IRS to receive, process and store paper checks and money orders.  This may include, but is not limited to, the acceptance of electronic fund transfers, intermediary conversion of paper checks and money orders to electronic transactions, or credit card transactions.   The IRS has a requirement for a contractor to provide an electronic payment product that allows taxpayers to make federal tax payments through convenient, safe and secure means and to collect the appropriate service fees from the taxpayer to cover all costs incurred to deliver the services requested by the U.S. Government.  IRS further anticipates the award of a contract/s for a one year base period and four one-year option periods.  

The required services have been determined to meet the definition of commercial items in accordance with FAR Part 2.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  Pursuant to the Taxpayer Relief of 1997 (IRC 6311(d) (2), the Secretary is authorized to enter into contracts to obtain services related to receiving payment by other means where cost beneficial to the Government.    The Secretary may not provide any fee or provide any other consideration under such contracts.  No U.S. Government appropriated or non-appropriated funds will be made available or utilized in performance of the resultant contracts.  The taxpayer will be responsible for paying the Contractor directly for services rendered.  
Potential offeror/s possessing the capability of providing these services are invited to submit, on a voluntary basis, in writing, sufficient information that demonstrates the ability to fulfill this requirement. Documentation submitted should include specific experience with and working knowledge of Electronic Payment Services.   Please Note:  page limitation is hereby limited to 3 pages exclusive of the completion of Attachment 2, Section 508 Standards and provisions.

All responses to this Request for Information (RFI) shall include Company Name and address, business size and type (1) small business; 2) 8(a) business; 3) HUB Zone small business; 4) small disadvantaged business; 5) woman-owned small business; (6) veteran-owned small business; (7) service-disabled veteran-owned small business, or (8) large business), business and technical points of contact including e-mail addresses and telephone numbers.  Acknowledgement of your company?s registration in the Central Contracting Registration database www.ccr.gov is required.  

Any questions regarding this posting must be submitted in writing via email to the both points of contact as denoted herein on or before October 24, 2007 in order to allow answers to questions to be publicly posted before the required response date of 29 October 2007.  Please do not call the Contracting Office for information.  We hope to eliminate duplicate questions by posting any and all questions on the www.fbo.gov website.  Note: Department of Treasury, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will ensure that any/all information received in response to this Request for Information (RFI) will be protected and treated the same as if it were Source Selection Sensitive Information.  However, if any questions contain proprietary information such information must be identified

Additional information or updates will be posted at the www.fbo.gov website.  It is the responsibility of interested parties to check this website regularly for any changes or updates.  Responses must be provided no later than October 29, 2007.  No extensions will be granted.

It then was broken out into the 541711 and 541712 codes.  541712 is more appropriate for the requirement covered under t he solicitation.  The RFP should still be issued on or about November 5, 2007.  Details on the description as covered under the sources sought can be seen on the amendment issued last week under 541711.  Again, the solicitation is going to go out under NAI CS code 541712 which is the correct NAICS code.

<SUBJECT>61--Reclamation is seeking sources for lease and other services related to Doble Engineering equipment.
<SOLNBR>08SP810026
<RESPDATE>110207
<ARCHDATE>10162008
<CONTACT>Michael Sanford  3034452434     msandord@do.usbr.gov;
<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT: The Bureau of Reclamation, Denver Office has a requirement for a firm-fixed price contract, to lease insulation analysis equipment and supporting services associated with testing of electric power apparatus insulation.  The lease will be for the time period of January 1, 2008 through September 30, 2008, with four one-year option periods starting on October 1, 2008 and each subsequent year to 2012.   This procurement is set-aside for small businesses.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 334515, small business size standard of 500 employees.   Reclamation has been leasing the following equipment and services from Doble Engineering (Doble).  Interested parties must be able to deliver the identified equipment and full package of services to the same level as furnished by Doble. Background: In 1959, Reclamation instituted a program to determine the condition of electric power insulation by the power factor test method.  Doble manufactures and leases power factor test equipment and provides training in operation of test equipment, technical interpretation of test results, and a client conference each year for the dissemination of information in the field of electric power insulation testing.  Initially, several Reclamation regions individually contracted with Doble to lease power factor test equipment.  Since 1965, a consolidated contract has been in place covering all five Reclamation regions.   Doble services are subscribed to by major electrical utilities and Government agencies operating a large portion of the electric power generation and transmission capacity of the United States.  Data gathered from equipment operating histories from these clients for more than fifty years gives Doble a computerized reference file unequaled in the electric power industry.  Reclamation, in contract with Doble, has access to that reference file which is used extensively in analyzing test data to assess the condition of equipment. Doble maintains a well-equipped laboratory for testing and research on insulating fluids, in addition to providing gas-in-oil analysis.  Reclamation, in contract with Doble, has access to that reference data. Doble conducts an annual conference at which new developments in the testing and maintenance of electric power equipment are discussed by Doble engineers, representatives of client companies, and the major electric equipment design and manufacturing companies.  Reclamation, in contract with Doble, has access to this conference. As part of the contract, Doble conducts annual training for Reclamation staff at a Reclamation facility in the use of power factor test equipment and analysis of test data.  This training can be attended by any Reclamation personnel free of charge (except for normal travel expenses).  This training can and has been tailored to the specific equipment located at the Reclamation facility. Doble employs a staff of highly qualified and specialized engineers and scientists.  Reclamation, in contract with Doble, has access to the knowledge and technical expertise held by the Doble staff.  Reclamation is in regular contact with Doble engineers regarding the analysis of test data and obtaining information about cutting edge research being performed at their facility. Leased Doble Engineering test equipment shall include: nine M4000 Insulation Analyzers, one M5200 Sweep Frequency Response Analyzer, one Type C Resonating Inductor, one M4110 Leakage Reactance Interface, nine Doble Test Assistant Software Field Versions, two TTR Capacitors, and nine M4300 Transports.    Other services provided shall be to the same level as Doble Engineering and shall include:  A database of electric power equipment insulation test data gathered from major electrical utilities and Government agencies operating a large portion of the electric power generation and transmission capacity of the United States; a well-equipped laboratory for testing and research on insulating fluids, in addition to providing gas-in-oil analysis; an annual conference at which new developments in the testing and maintenance of electric power equipment are discussed by equipment test engineers, representative client companies and major electric equipment design and manufacturing companies; annual training for Reclamation staff at a Reclamation facility in the use of power factor test equipment and analysis of test data (attended by Reclamation staff free of charge). Interested parties should include the following in their response: Business name, address, contact, and telephone number.  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources because of this synopsis.     If you can provide such services, send an e-mail NO LATER THAN NOVEMBER 2, 2007.  Any contractor to be awarded a government contract must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR), http://www.ccr.gov.  Any contractor submitting a quotation, offer or proposal to the Government must complete their Representations and Certifications online at http://orca.bpn.gov.   Contractors must submit their Tax Identification Number (TAX ID) and Data Universal Number (DUNS) with their offer.     Responses can be emailed to msanford@do.usbr.gov, or mailed to Bureau of Reclamation, Bldg 56, Rm 1040, Denver Federal Center, Denver, CO 80225, and Attn: Michael J. Sanford, 84-27810.

<CONTACT>Philip M Kirby, Contracting Officer, 865-574-3233, kirbypm@yso.doe.gov;Philip M Kirby, Contract Specialist, 865-574-3233, kirbypm@yso.doe.gov
<DESC>Surplus Off-Spec LEU â€“ Expression of Interest The Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) (DOE/NNSA) has the authority to dispose of its off-specification uranium under the Atomic Energy Act and USEC Privatization Act sections 3112(d) or (e). In light of market conditions and past informal expressions of interest, DOE/NNSA is seeking formal expressions of interest in the purchase of up to 250 metric tons (MT) of surplus, off-specification U.S. low-enriched uranium (LEU) enriched to a nominal 4.95% U-235 assay.  DOE/NNSA is developing a list of companies that may be interested in the purchase of the surplus off-spec LEU. Interested parties may be commercial nuclear power companies, nuclear fuel cycle suppliers, or teams consisting of several interested firms. The LEU being offered will be derived from processing and down-blending of highly enriched uranium (HEU) metals, oxides and reactor fuel elements at the Savannah River Site (SRS) H Canyon and associated facilities near Aiken, South Carolina.  This material will produce LEU that does not meet applicable ASTM specifications for commercial nuclear power reactor fuel.  The anticipated LEU specifications are attached to this announcement.  (Attachment 1) Should DOE/NNSA, in its sole discretion, elect to issue a solicitation leading to an award, DOE/NNSA intends to require qualified interested parties to demonstrate that they would be able to provide the following: â€¢ Delivery of natural uranium in the form of uranyl nitrate solution (as specified in Attachment 2) to SRS for use as diluent.  The quantity of diluent required is estimated to be up to 226.6 MT, depending on the quantity of LEU. â€¢ Acceptance of delivery of the resulting LEU in the form of uranyl nitrate solution at SRS beginning by December 31, 2008.  DOE/NNSA expects to deliver the material at a roughly steady rate during calendar years 2009-2019 if the full 250 MT is provided. If DOE/NNSA elects to solicit bids, the sale will be consistent with DOEâ€™s proposed excess uranium inventory management plan and the long-term uranium sales strategy. Interested parties should respond to this announcement by providing the following information:  Company name, address, a point of contact, contact information (phone number and e-mail) and a statement of capabilities that includes: â€¢  identification of any concerns or issues that could impact a decision to bid on this material; â€¢  suggestions on the structure of the business arrangement that may improve the economics of the sale; â€¢  an estimated percentage discount, from current market prices for the uranium and enrichment content of the LEU provided, that the interested party would expect to receive on the price it pays DOE/NNSA for the material, taking into consideration the off-specification characteristics and uranyl nitrate form of the material, and the need to provide diluent. DOE/NNSA may contact responding companies for additional information. Standard company brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this Sources Sought Synopsis.  Submission of a capability statement does not commit an interested party to submit a proposal.  All responses received will be treated as source selection information and will not be released to the public. Businesses responding to this market survey must submit their responses via the DOE IIPS at http://e-center.doe.gov no later than 4:00 p.m., eastern daylight savings time, on November 19, 2007.  Interested parties must register via the IIPS web site prior to responding to this market survey.  Instructions on how to submit your response can be found in the help document located on the IIPS web site listed above.  For technical assistance, firms should call 1-800-683-0751 or e-mail the IIPS administrator at helpdesk@pr.doe.gov. THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A REQUEST FOR A FORMAL PROPOSAL OR A PRESOLICITATION NOTICE.  This notice is provided as information to the marketplace and is an invitation for an expression of interest and demonstration of capability to perform the anticipated work.  The Government will not pay for the provision of any information nor will it compensate any respondents for the development of such information.  While a future Request for Proposals may be issued, it is not guaranteed.

When a compound appears to be a possible therapeutic candidate, there is a need for more extensive receptor profiling to insure that biological activity is specific to the systems of interest.  Extensive profiling lessens the possibility of unexpected side effects in biological systems not specifically studied in the initial screens.  This contract will provide a mechanism to profile selected compounds at a wide variety of receptor targets, ion channels and enzyme sites to assess the potential for side effects.  The contract allows screening of a large number of substances from pharmaceutical or chemical compound libraries at selected receptors to discover novel compounds with specified biological activity.   ***THE CONTRACTOR should be able to perform the following assays as a core battery, but also have the capacity to perform or develop other assays as needed by NIDA:  NEUROTRANSMITTER related: Adenosine, non-selective; Adrenergic, alpha-1, non-selective;Adrenergic, alpha-2, non-selective; Adrenergic, beta-1;Cannabinoid, CB1; Cannabinoid, CB2;Dopamine, D4.2; GABA-A, agonist site; GABA-A, BDZ, alpha-1 site; GABA-B; Glutamate, AMPA site; Glutamate, Kainate site; Glutamate, NMDA agonist site; Glutamate, mGluR1 (metabotropic); Glutamate, mGluR5 (metabotropic); Glutamate, NMDA, Glycine (strychnine-insensitive site) (ionotropic); Glutamate, NMDA, PCP Site; Glycine, strychnine-sensitive; Histamine, H1; Histamine, H2; Histamine, H3; Muscarinic, M1; Muscarinic, M2;

<DESC>This is not a Solicitation For Proposals


Request for Information

Purpose


This Request for Information (RFI) is issued to survey the commercial market for potential alternate COTS solutions to replace the current U.S Army Contract Automated Contract Writing Capabilities. 

The Office of The Secretary of the Army Acquisition and Logistics is evaluating the current automated contract writing capabilities and considering alternate contract writing systems for future deployment. The focus is to take advantage of advancements in technology while benefiting from competitive industry trends.   The overall goal is to deploy a system that is designed on and embeds the latest technology and a system that provides user satisfaction while elevating the proficiency of mission accomplishments.  In addition the ideal system will be designed to accommodate technology infusion in a seamless and cost effective manner.

The Army is seeking an ultimate solution and is eager to see what new and innovative technology and systems are either on the market and or in the developmental stages.  One of the major considerations being studied is a benefit analysis of moving to a web based centric system such as the DoD SPS PD? version 4.2.3 (which has been developed and tested, however is currently on the shelf and no definitive decision has been made related to deployment).  It will be considered during the Army Business Case Analysis merely as a potential alternate solution.

The Business Operations & Enterprise Directorate (SAAL-PB), 5109 Leesburg Pike, Falls Church, Virginia, serves as the executive agent for contracting and procurement business systems that support paperless contracting.  The SAAL-PB office provides support for net-centric contracting services across the Army worldwide. The systems for which SAAL-PB has current responsibility include the Army Contracting Business Intelligence System and the DoD Standard Procurement System (SPS), known as Procurement Desktop-Defense, PD2.   As new processes and systems are developed in support of Army contracting and procurement, it is the responsibility of this office to implement the approved systems.  The office also provides guidance and oversight for current and new e-business systems in support of Army contracting worldwide.  The SAAL-PB office has an ongoing Business Case Analysis (BCA) Process to identify potential alternate contract writing system solutions for Army wide deployment.  The BCA process will provide the Army Decision makers with recommendations as to weather to continue use of the present system and/or select an alternate system that offers a higher level of performance at a reasonable cost for acquisition, deployment and sustainment. 
The system being sought is to support the worldwide U.S. Army Contracting Activities with state of the arts functional capabilities that is designed to operate in conjunction with and or to potentially replace existing Legacy Systems.   
 

Background 

The Army presently utilizes the ?Procurement Desktop-Defense (PD?)? which is a part of the SPS Suite of products and the Army Material Command  "Procurement Automated Data & Document Systems" (PADDS) which is a Government owned and operated system. 
The Department of Defense's Standard Procurement System (SPS) program was created to bring the advantages of automation and standardization to the procurement process throughout DoD. The joint SPS program office has developed, tested and deployed a suite of software products for use by contracting professionals in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and other defense agencies. The primary software application sustained by the SPS program is Procurement Desktop Defense or "PD?) which is currently deployed to over 20,000 users at approximately 800 sites around the world.  SPS is the name of the joint DoD program and" PD?" is the name of the currently deployed procurement software application.
Since 1997 there have been numerous versions of PD? with ever increasing functionality. The latest version of the software is known as Version 4 - Increment 2 (v4.2). Using standard Windows conventions, this client-server application provides data input screens that capture all the elements necessary for the creation and administration of DoD contracts and related documents.
Using adaptive technology, PD? is being linked to logistics and financial systems to enable accurate tracking and reporting of financial data through the budgeting, requisition, contracting, contract administration, payment and contract close-out processes.

Current Status of the SPS Program and Procurement Defense Desktop PD? version 4.2.2,

The Standard Procurement System (SPS) Program is the cornerstone for the DoD?s paperless acquisition. Procurement Desktop-Defense (PD?) provides automated strategic, streamlined contract management support for the procurement professional within a complete workflow management solution.  Detailed information related to this product can be found at http://sps.caci.com/products/ 
The Standard Procurement System (SPS) Program and Procurement Desktop-Defense (PD?) is in a sustainment. The Army is looking for  a  more technology advanced system to meet its worldwide contract writing system requirements.  
Procurement Desktop Defense:
?X	Used by over 20,000 procurement professionals worldwide 
?X	Implements joint requirements and best business practices 
?X	Supports DoD's goals for Financial Management and Accountability 
?X	Helps get our warfighters what they need when they need it 
High Level System Requirements For Future Deployment

The High Level Requirements are for a Contract Writing System that as a minimum provides the functional capabilities that are currently provided by the Procurement Defense Desktop PD? version 4.2.2, in addition to the functional capabilities of the Army Material Command PAADS. 


Nature of Responses Sought

Respondents are encouraged to provide product information and offer approaches that merit further consideration for U.S. Army consideration.  The Information should fully describe operational functionality and describe infrastructure requirements to include concepts for deployment and training.    All responses will be evaluated for merit and technical feasibility.  Additional information maybe requested to support an ongoing Business Case Analysis which will incorporate findings and recommendations for the Best Technical and Cost Effective Approach for the Army to Acquire a cost effective, user friendly and highly productive system. 

Respondents may submit multiple solutions & approaches however they must be submitted in a manner that reflects a distinct separation from each other.

<DESC>*** BACKGROUND *** The National Pandemic Influenza Plan (Nov. 1, 2005) designates the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as the lead agency for public health and medical response for pandemic preparedness. Following the issuance of this plan, the office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) was charged with gathering information, developing policies and issuing recommendations on specific medical countermeasures may be used to contain, control, and mitigate the mortality and morbidity associated with an influenza pandemic in the U.S. The office of Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is responsible for the tactical and logistical implementation of policies and decisions regarding these countermeasures, including the establishment of a stockpile of supplies to prevent or control the spread of pandemic influenza disease. This is a Request for Information (RFI) about parties with the interest and capabilities to perform certain pre-clinical testing of vaccine components in the BARDA pandemic preparedness stockpile.  It is not a request for proposals and does not commit the U.S. Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the U.S. Government and will not be returned.


*** OBJECTIVE *** As part of its preparations, HHS/ASPR/BARDA has established a stockpile of avian influenza vaccine antigens to be administered in a pandemic or pre-pandemic situation for the prevention of avian influenza disease. In order to extend the number of effective doses that can be provided from the stockpile, BARDA is also working with manufacturers to develop antigen-sparing technologies such as components that can be added to the vaccine to enhance its immune response, known as adjuvants.  In the event of a pandemic emergency, HHS would like to be able to extend the available stockpile of antigens by administering them with adjuvants depending on availability.  In order to have this ability, BARDA, in conjunction with NIH, CDC, and the antigen and adjuvant manufacturers, is planning to conduct clinical testing of possible antigen:adjuvant combinations, the results of which would be submitted to U.S. regulatory agencies as support for an Emergency Use Authorization.  A prerequisite for performing these clinical studies is the completion of GLP general toxicology testing of the investigational vaccine formulations to enable the filing of an IND to FDA. To conduct this testing, BARDA seeks qualified contract research organizations having the necessary capabilities and willingness to perform the studies. This is a request for such organizations to make themselves known to BARDA and provide information concerning their capabilities to perform the studies.  Please provide information concerning the following required capabilities. 


1.	Designing and conducting standard GLP general toxicology safety testing in rabbits according to protocols and standards sufficient to support the filing of an IND for clinical testing in humans

a.	Protocol design and execution
b.	Housing of animals in accredited facilities, administration of vaccine, 
c.	Observation and recording of animal welfare 
d.	Collection of sera 
e.	Clinical chemistry and immunological testing of sera
f.	Euthanasia by approved methods 
g.	Post-mortem histopathological analysis of test subject tissues 

2.	Mixing ad hoc of two vaccine components just prior to immunization according to procedure to be provided 

3.	Compliance with all applicable local, state, and federal regulations for housing and experimental testing with lab animals

4.	Capacity for up to 90 rabbits for the duration of the study

5.	Availability to start in Dec07-Jan08 timeframe


Data obtained from this RFI will be used by HHS in making recommendations and decisions on the development of an appropriate procurement strategy for National Pandemic Preparedness. 
All information submitted to HHS will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant Federal law and will be eligible for additional special protections under the conditions of the Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) Program outlined in the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002. 
Information must be submitted by 3:00 p.m. (EST) on Oct. 15, 2007. Include the name, email address and telephone number of a primary contact point at your organization for this RFI in the event that HHS has additional questions or requires clarification on the submitted information. Responses are limited to 2 pages.     
Your response to this RFI must be submitted electronically in .pdf format and emailed to RFI-OPHEMC-07-01@hhs.gov.  The type of business submitting the response (i.e., small business, large business, hub-zone, small and disadvantaged business, etc.) must be identified in your response.     If the service can be acquired on a GSA schedule, VA schedule, or other Government-wide acquisition vehicle, please supply the contract title and number, contract point of contact information and the name of the awarding agency.

<RESPDATE>103107
<CONTACT>Patty Snyder, Contract Specialist, Phone 614-692-1127, Fax null, Email patty.snyder@dscc.dla.mil
<DESC>DLA is soliciting parties interested in a prime service integrator initiative for HMMWV Industrial Support. The contractor shall function as the Prime Service Integrator in support of all production/ maintenance line of the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) for which the Services assign to DLA line side parts supports. The HMMWV Industrial Support Initiative, and is scheduled to start sometime after December 2008.  This program requires the Prime Service Integrator to own, manage, kit, forecast and deliver inventory to the customer.  The billing and payment cycle begins at the time of use by (or delivery to) the customer. Current performance sites are at Letterkenney Army Depot (LEAD) and Red River Army Depot (RRAD).  Limited stock deliveries are also provided to Maine Military Authority (MMA). 

For this initiative, the Contractor will not be expected to perform the actual production/maintenance of HMMWV, but will be expected to perform logistical support to maintain the production/maintenance lines by providing line side part support through supply bins and stocking points to ensure the parts are there when needed by the production/maintenance workers.  As part of that logistical support the Contractor will both purchase parts directly and acquire parts from the Government, specifically DLA and TACOM.   This initiative is designed to optimize the supply chain by having a prime service integrator:
1)	Tailor its support to production/maintenance lines of a single weapon system and its variants,
2)	To push its managed inventory to the line side bins and stocking points when and where needed by the production/maintenance workers, and
3)	Allowing DOD to pay for materiel only when delivered for point of consumption use to the end user (Integrated Logistics Partnership Concept) by moving the point of inspection and point of sale to the point of use.   

Please answer the following questions with specific examples and descriptions of your current or past experience in light of the requirements described above.  If possible, please provide proper program names, contract numbers, and points of contact with each example.

A written response is requested by October 31, 2007.  Please email your response to:  Pattricia.Snyder@dla.mil and CC: Carla.Pennington@dla.mil and Jennifer.Millenbaugh.ctr@dla.mil.  If you have any questions, please email them to the same address and or call:  614-692-1127.

<DESC>This is not a Solicitation For Proposals,

Request For Information, 

Purpose:

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
PURSUANT TO FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) 15.202(e)

INTRODUCTION
The Defense Media Center (DMC), located in Riverside, California, intends to replace its current Lucent/Avaya Definity G3si PBX system.  The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to gather information to assist the DMC in formulating its requirements and identifying qualified sources which are able to meet its requirements.  Respondents are encouraged to provide information about alternatives that can help the DMC better define its requirements and obtain an Internet Protocol (IP)-centric switch that meets its needs.  All equipment and software used with the IP switch must be approved by the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) due to Department of Defense (DoD) regulations.


BACKGROUND
The DMC manages the American Forces Network Broadcast Center (AFN-BC).  The AFN-BC provides radio and television programming ? ?a touch of home? ? to approximately 900,000 U.S. service men and women, DoD civilians, and their families serving outside the United States in 177 countries and aboard Navy ships at sea.

The building sits on a 12-acre campus.  It?s about 110,000 square feet in size and is made up of four bay areas that house mainly cubicles and a few hard offices. The current switch is in a Main Closet with three additional interconnected Telecom Closets throughout the building.  The DMC employs close to 328  DoD and military members. There are 865 active subscribers on the current PBX system. Of the 865 ports being used, there are 150 active modem and fax lines, 62 ports used for our in-house wireless telephones (Avaya 9631 Model), and five Polycom Sound Stations used for conference calls.

PURPOSE OF RFI
The goal is to replace the Definity PBX system with an IP-centric telephony solution which keeps pace with technology, provides maximum benefit to our customers and frees Engineering from the onerous tasks inherent with legacy telecom infrastructures.
  

FEATURES AND REQUIREMENTS
The solution shall have no single points of failure and allow hardware and software updates without disrupting ongoing phone calls.

The IP telephony Local Area Network (LAN) shall not interface with the enterprise Information Technology (IT) LAN.   

The in-house wireless telephones (Avaya 9631) are to be replaced with IP-centric based wireless telephones that support the 802.11a wireless network.
 
The IP telephony network must support and be able to run the Electronic Call Accounting System (ECAS) 4.0 or higher or have its own call accounting system along with the JITC-approved Call Manager program. 

Other desired features and requirements:  
-	Auto Attendants
-	Enhanced Voicemail

-	Option to support Emergency response scenarios with automatic database updates regarding extension location information
-	Find-me-Follow-me capability
-	Mobility/Telecommuting
-	Presence feature

Request block diagram of the proposed system be included.

Request vendor to provide five or more IP communications reference accounts that have at least 5,000 IP phones installed.

Any solicitation that may result from this RFI in the future will require the bidder to provide equipment, installation, certification, training and a multi-year warranty with 24/7 response.


DISCLAIMER
This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a
solicitation. In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

<SUBJECT>R -- A-76 Cost Comparison DOL Employment Standards Administration (ESA) Wage & Hour Division (WHD) National Certification Program Streamlined w/MEO CA Study
<DESC>FORMAL NOTICE OF A76 COMPETITIVE SOURCING STUDY. This notice constitutes the formal announcement and commencement of the A-76 cost comparison study for the DOL Employment Standards Administration (ESA) Wage & Hour Division (WHD) National Certification Program A-76 Streamlined CA Study on 9/28/2005, under the revised OMB Circular A-76, dated 29 May 2003.  The start date is 9/30/2006, until concluded under the Streamlined Competition Process that will include an MEO. This study is expected to be completed on or earlier than June 28, 2006 at which time a formal decision shall be rendered.  However, the Competitive Sourcing Official has granted an extension of 45 additional days if deemed necessary for completion. These services are located in San Francisco, CA, Chicago, IL, Dallas, TX, Atlanta, GA, Philadelphia, PA, Washington, DC, State of Florida, State of New Jersey, and the State of Virginia and are performed by 10 (FTE) personnel.  Personnel involved in the ESA/WHD study provide, develop or support work that includes clerical, administrative, data entry, mail handling, customer service and other program support activities related to the certification processes required by the Wage and Hour Division under the following legislation/regulations: 
1) Farm Labor [MSPA Title I CFR 29 Chapter V Part 500];
2) Workers with Disabilities [FLSA Section 14(c) CFR 29 Chapter V Part 525];
3) Full Time Students [FLSA Section 14(b) CFR 29 Chapter V Part 519];
4) Homeworker [FLSA Section 11(a) CFR 29 Chapter V Part 530];
5) Student Learner [Section 14(d) CFR 29 Chapter V Part 520].
The activities identified in this competition are performed by function codes I440, D103 and T820, support Contractor (Harris) personnel, and state government personnel from Florida, New Jersey and Virginia.  The purpose of this Streamlined w/MEO A-76 study is to determine whether it is less expensive for industry or the Government to continue to perform the operation as-is, as prescribed in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76, "Performance of Commercial Activities", which sets forth the general policy of the Government to achieve economy and enhance productivity. The circular requires Federal agencies to review their commercial activities (CA) functions under several methods to determine whether it would be more economical to continue operating them in-house (i.e., with Government employees) or under contract with commercial sources. The method chosen by the Department of Labor for ESA/WHD National Certification Program competition is a Streamlined w/MEO study.  Reviews shall be conducted in accordance with Circular A-76.  The Competitive Sourcing Official (CSO) is Mr. Patrick Pizzella, the Agency Tender Official is Mr. Carl Smith, and the Contracting Officer/SSA is Mr. Peter Higginbotham.  The cost comparison process is as follows:  in accordance with the A-76 Circular, and Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Contracting Officer will analyze market pricing information against the Government’s MEO estimate to perform the function and make a final decision.  If it appears that market analyses are properly supported, showing substantive proof that the private/commercial pricing is more cost effective than the government’s, a decision may be made to issue a formal RFP and ultimately go contract.  This is not a RFP, not a request for sources sought, and no solicitation has been developed at this time. A formal cost proposal is not currently being sought from industry.  If the government MEO estimate is more cost effective a decision shall be rendered to retain the function in-house. This will be the only announcement made for this effort.  Any comments should be directed solely to the Director of Competitive Sourcing, Mr. Larry Clark at Clark.Larry@dol.gov.

<SUBJECT>58 -- PDA-184 USB RADIO INTERFACE CABLE
<DESC>PDA-184 USB RADIO INTERFACE CABLE

The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) located at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida intends to contract directly with SeaLevel Systems, Inc., 155 Technology Place (PO Box 830), Liberty, South Carolina 29657.  USSOCOM has a requirement for five (5) different SeaLevel Systems, Inc. Universal Serial Bus (USB) to Synchronous Serial Adapter Radio Interface Cables.  Each cable will be used to connect either a military laptop, or a personal digital assistants (PDAs), etc. to one of the following four (4) radios: the AN/ARC-231, AN/PRC-117F, AN/PRC-148 and the AN/PRC-150 to transfer data from one to the other.  This data transfer requires a SeaLevel proprietary synchronous driver (permits normal commercial protocols and MILITARY-STANDARD ?frameless? transmissions) to interface between the respective cables? hardware and PDA-184 (a Government developed software application compliant with MIL-STD-188-184).

Each five-foot long ruggedized cable and their interface adapter (AWM E101344 style 20276 VW-1 Space Shuttle-D) will use militarized connectors that mate a Synchronous Serial Interface adapter and one of the following four connectors: (1) MIL connector Part Number: MS27473T18B32S which mates to the AN/ARC-231 Red input/output (I/O) (J3) data/auxiliary jack/port and its backshell, Part Number: M85049/49-2S18W; (2) connector; Harris Part Number 11093-0601-03 which mates to the AN/PRC-117F data/auxiliary jack/port; (3) connector Thales Part Number 1100628-501 which mates to the AN/PRC-148 data/auxiliary jack/port or the Joint Enhanced MBITR; (4) connector Harris Part Number 11093-0601-03 which mates to the AN/PRC-150 data/auxiliary jack/port, (5) a male DB-25 connector which can be mated to any radio?s data/auxiliary jack/port if the radio has data cable with a corresponding female DB-25 connector.  The cable and synchronous interface assembly use MIL connectors for the USB and Serial interface connections that provide strain relief.  A SeaLevel proprietary printed circuit board (PCB) is enclosed in a ruggedized over molded enclosure (sometimes known as a bump-in-the cable) that provides a high degree of resistance to impact, vibration, moisture, and dust.  The cable and PCB are designed as one integrated unit to provide durability and performance at the lightest weight possible.

The PCB, cable and driver operate without the loss of bit count integrity at all rates supported by the radio.  The radio interface to the PCB could be any of the following: RS-232, RS-422, RS-485, RS-530, RS-530A, or V.35.  The SeaLevel Systems, Inc PCB, cables, MIL Connectors, and associated driver software (proprietary to SeaLevel) are the only known product that meets these requirements and are qualified by the Government to work with MIL-STD-188-184 software.  Each cable sought in this synopsis will be fully compatible with each other and with the SeaLevel 3612-2099, 5102, 9064 and 9065 synchronous serial interface adapters currently in use by USSOCOM and DISA.  No other products are known that could perform the above functions.  SeaLevel hardware and driver software were exclusively used during Compliance and Certification testing of the PDA-184 software via dedicated SATCOM, DAMA SATCOM and LOS using SINCGARS, and Have Quick

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation, N00173-08-R-TA01, is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 2005-20  and DFARS Change Notice 20070913. NRL has a requirement for Contract Line Item(s): CLIN 0001: The Contractor shall conduct a Facility Condition Assessment (FCA) on building systems in accordance with the requirements set forth in the Statement of Work, Quantity: 1, Unit:  EA; CLIN 0002, The Contractor shall provide a Facility Condition Assessment Report in accordance with the requirements set forth in the Statement of Work, Quantity: 1, Unit: LO. The Statement of Work is as follows: The Contractor shall conduct a Facility Condition Assessment Report, FCA, on building systems, which will consist of roofing, piping, HVAC, electrical, fire protection, architectural, and structural systems including assessments of specific elements within each system.  The work includes providing a FCA on twenty-six buildings totaling 842,199 square feet and 11,303 linear feet of perimeter fencing.  The contractor shall provide a survey team consisting of construction professionals to inspect the architectural, structural, mechanical, fire protection and electrical components of the buildings.  Systems to be inspected include but are not limited to: exterior systems, i.e., walls, windows, roofing, doors, etc., interior systems, such as, walls, doors, flooring, visible structures, HVAC systems, exhaust systems, laboratory utilities, electrical and electrical distribution systems, plumbing systems, fire protection systems, special construction systems, and vertical transport systems.  The FCA report must contain both an assessment of building systems replacement cycle for building renovation decisions and a detailed component replacement analysis based on component condition and its observed projected remaining useful life.  The report must provide life cycle cost analysis to identify where excessive maintenance costs can be compared to component replacement or where multiple component replacement should be compared to system replacement.  Facility replacement is not an option for analysis, this is a condition assessment not code compliance assessment.  While components and systems replaced need to meet the American with Disability Act, the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and the Life Safety Code, this effort is strictly an existing component and system assessment and it does not include analysis to initiate new construction to bring buildings into code compliance.  Where deficiencies are observed, the Contractor shall place them in condition categories such as the following: Failed or failing, poor, fair, good, or new/excellent condition.  The Contractor shall provide an assessment predicting facility component life expirations using statistical guidelines and nationally recognized references for cost data to model building system costs.  The Contractor shall inspect all the electrical panels in each building including, but not limited to, inspection with an infrared gun to detect hot spots and to correct any loose connection found in the panels.  Deficiencies that will require less than 16 hours to correct will be reported to the Technical Manager for submittal using the NRL service call format.  Descriptions of deficiencies need to be in sufficient detail for work crews to locate and correct the deficiencies. This includes deficiencies that are beyond the scope of service calls.  Should the inspectors find an immediate life threatening or property-damaging situation they shall notify the Technical Manager within one hour of discovery.    It is anticipated that delivery and acceptance will be conducted at the NRL, Washington, D.C. 20375, FOB Destination.  The period of performance will be seventeen weeks from date of award broken down into the following milestones:  The draft FCA must be submitted within eleven weeks of award. The government will require three weeks to review the draft.  Upon completion of the government?s review, the contractor shall meet on site to receive and review documents within one week after being notified by the Government.  All contractor personnel involved in inspection and report preparation process must attend the site meeting, unless otherwise agreed upon by both the Technical Manager and the Contractor?s Program Manager.  The contractor shall provide final FCA report within two weeks after the site meeting discussing the Government?s comments.  The contractor shall provide six copies of the final report and one copy that must be an electronic version, using a mutually agreed upon IBM compatible form of electronic media and software package.  The Contractor shall also provide two copies of the draft and final service calls. The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition.

TECHNICAL QUOTE (VOLUME 1):

Evaluation Criteria
The government will review the offeror?s understanding of the requirements and the viability of the proposed approach to address the unique challenges, opportunities, and constraints inherent to this project.

The government will evaluate the proposal for the following elements. The factors are listed in descending order of importance. 

Factor 1:
The offeror?s Technical Approach 

?	The offerors understanding of the requirements and the viability of its proposed technical approach to address the unique challenges, opportunities, and constraints inherent to this project.
?	A Quality Assurance Plan that details the techniques, procedures, and methodologies that will be by the offeror to assure timely delivery that meets specified requirements of this solicitation.

Factor 2:
Past Performance/Similar Experience

The Government will evaluate performance of the offeror on past projects and experience.  Past performance is the degree of success, in terms of meeting or exceeding technical, cost, schedule and quality objectives, and the demonstrated effectiveness of corrective actions taken in dealing with problems encountered on prior projects.  The Government will also evaluate the extent of an offeror?s experience on projects of a similar size, scope, function, duration and complexity as compared to the work that is required under this solicitation.  From this information, the Government determines an overall risk assessment regarding the offeror?s likelihood of success on the proposed project.

This BAA was originally issued for a one year period beginning January 19, 2007, and ending January 18, 2008. However, programmatic changes have resulted in a decision to cancel the existing BAA and to issue a new BAA for the same program in the near future. The new BAA will reflect a common cut-off date for submission of pre-proposals rather than an open year-long solicitation. Please continue to monitor FedBizOps for the posting of the new BAA for this program.

The contractor must coordinate with local organizations, Major Command (MAJCOM), and all required agencies, including vendors, contractors, military, and civilian personnel employed by AFRS, as applicable.

3.0.     OPERATING ENVIRONMENT HARDWARE

3.1.     CURRENT OPERATING SYSTEM

The operating environment consists of six Hewlett-Packard (HP) AlphaServer clusters and one stand-alone systems development and management AlphaServer.  Design philosophy is based to the maximum extent possible on the no-single-point-of-failure concept and server clustering is employed to permit the orderly failover of services to surviving cluster members in the event of system failure.

Each cluster is connected via dual fibre channel fabrics to an HP storage area network (SAN) with redundant array controllers and disks fully mirrored across device buses and shelves.  Tape backups (nightly on-site database and weekly off-site full system) are performed on all but one of the clusters to a tape library attached to one of the fibre channel fabrics.  HP Tru64 UNIX and TruCluster Server 5.1b-3 and subsequent patches, plus HP proprietary diagnostic and management tools at the current revision level, are installed on every single-system-image cluster and stand-alone system.

Oracle9i Enterprise Edition with Real Application Clusters (RAC) and Partitioning software at the current patch level is installed once on each of the four clusters with multi-instance databases and Oracle9i Enterprise Edition only is installed on the other two clusters and on the stand-alone system.  The HP Java Software Development Kit 1.4.2-6 is installed on every cluster and stand-alone system.  EMC/Legato NetWorker 7.x.x Power Edition with EMC/Legato Module for Oracle 4.x.x (or higher) with the appropriate type and number of Legato Cluster Client, Legato Dedicated Storage Node, and Legato Autochanger Module licenses are installed on the five clusters equipped with a tape library.

A middle server tier for each cluster provides client connectivity and consists of one or more dual servers running Windows Server 2003 Enterprise Edition with Oracle10g Infrastructure/Applications Server and Oracle10g Forms and Reports.  The network infrastructure is both secure (firewall-protected) and sufficient to support all combined bandwidth requirements for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) communications between servers and with clients through Internet Service Providers (ISP), the Non-secure Internet Protocol Router NETwork (NIPRNET), and the Recruiting Service Network (RSN).  Programming languages include C/C++, Bourne/Korn shell, Structured Query Language (SQL), and HyperText Markup Language (HTML).  Auxiliary servers (for domain name service, configuration management, statistical analysis, geo-coding, etc.) are Intel 80x86-based systems with application-dependent amounts of memory and storage running Windows Server 2003 Enterprise Edition.

Stated software includes current and future versions. 

3.2.  	FUTURE OPERATING SYSTEM
The planned future operating environment will change from the current HP Tru64 UNIX / Oracle 9i RAC architecture to HP HP-UX 11i and Oracle 10g RAC.  Processors and storage area network capacity will double while the number of servers, server clusters, and amount of memory will remain the same.  Network connection speed will increase to 1Gbps and a centralized enterprise management and trouble alerting capability will be added.  Implementations will be staged through the end of FY09.
