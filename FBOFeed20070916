FAILURE TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION WILL RESULT IN A 'NON RESPONSIVE' BID AND REMOVAL FROM AWARD CONSIDERATION<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs Executive Office.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Panasonic Toughbook laptops.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.WHA/EX has identified the Panasonic Toughbook laptops, noted above, as a key component of the Bureau’s computer systems. The laptops provide computing capabilities for bureau users who connect to WHA systems for presentations and during travel outside the CONUS.  The Systems Office has developed an image for these laptops which mirrors the standard WHA desktop configuration and facilitates connectivity to our office system and printers.  We have found that the rugged specifications of these laptops have enabled them to function in harsh conditions found in third world countries and following natural disasters such as hurricanes which are common in the WHA region.  They are recognized as the industry leader for performance and durability and are used extensively by DOD.  The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s mobile computer system. Panasonic Toughbook laptops are a de facto standard within the Department and IT industry.<BR><BR>

<DESC>NASA/DFRC has a requirement for 4 G2 Land Mobile hard cases and 2 G2 Land Mobile soft cases. These radios are essentially portable telephones that use direct connection to satellite, thus are independent of existing local telephone infrastructure. These phones will work outside the world when all existing telephone infrastructure has been destroyed or is otherwise unavailable.  This system is a primary emergency communication link intended for emergency use at Dryden following a major event. NASA/DFRC intends to purchase the items from Skybase Communications. This product and vendor was selected during a meeting of the NASA Disaster Preparedness Coordinators as a method of achieving NASA wide emergency communication inoperability. This was decided because of the performance of the equipment and the dependability in the wake of a disaster. This is a standard for all NASA centers and could result in compatibility issues if purchased elsewhere.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and 13. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 25, 2007. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are NOT acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

The point of contact is Mr. Bill Swain, U.S. Department of State, (RM/GFS/GS), 1969 Dyess Ave., Charleston, SC 29405 (843) 308.5475.  The Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of Cisco Smartnet Maintenance. The use of brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure requirements, and continuity of current operations, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another brand name. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1). FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency needs or requirements. All Routers and switches used at Global Financial Services Charleston (RM/GFS), U.S Department of State, Springfield, VA and DoS IRM OPS ITI PMA, Springfield, VA are made and maintained by CISCO.  When they were initially purchased an extended service agreement is purchased with the equipment. The extended service agreement upgrades the base service agreement to provide services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.  To purchase this type of service from a non-OEM vendor would be a waste of government dollars as this is an “add-on” to the existing service contract vice a new contract.<BR><BR>A) Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec) B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging. C) Seller is providing these products via Cisco authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales.

<DESC>The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, 7180 Highland Drive, Pittsburgh, PA  15206, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Luminetx, 1256 Union Avenue, Memphis, TN 38104 for the purchase of the VeinViewer Imaging System. The VeinViewer will provide the ability to access superficial vasculature within 12mm depth under the skin with 100% accuracy. The VeinViewer uses a combination of near-infrared light and patented technologies to image vascular structures, thus allowing physicians, nurses and other healthcare professionals to clearly see accessible vasculature (or lack thereof) in real time, directly on the surface of the skin.  The VeinViewer by LuminetxT also utilizes patented technologies to illuminate subcutaneous vasculature by imaging their location on the surface of the skin. VeinViewer is a mobile biomedical device consisting of the following four components:  Infrared light source - The light source emits a harmless, near-infrared light reflected back to the surface from the tissue surrounding the vein, while no light is reflected back from the blood inside the vessel. Digital video camera - The digital video camera captures the near-infrared light reflected back from the patient. Image processing unit - The microprocessor adds contrast and projects this image back on the skin in their actual location. Digital image projector - Using Texas Instruments Digital Light ProcessingT technology, the projector displays these real-time images of the vasculature onto the surface of the skin.  This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  Vendors who wish to identify their interest and ability to provide an alternate item that will meet the capabilities and functionality described above may notify the Contracting Officer, in writing, no later than 2:00 p.m. September 24, 2007.  Such notification must include a complete description of the equipment that is required including narrative and qualifications as described above.  Responses may be sent to Kathleen.Policicchio@va.gov or mailed to Kathleen Policicchio, Contracting Officer (04A1-H), VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, 7180 Highland Drive, Pittsburgh, PA  15206.  Upon receipt of any such notifications, the Contracting Officer will determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement or proceed with sole source negotiations.

Is to respond the question

1. Do you prepare a budget for more than the base year?

9. We envision being able to accomplish this project in collaboration with some resources that we can tap from our relationships in India. This would have the benefit of a good cost-benefit as well as excellent quality. Will you be open to such a collaborative proposal from us? The project would be lead by our company in California.  

Answer - This project must be conducted at the place of performance and cannot feasibly be done off-site.  We would not be open to such a collaborative proposal based on the lack of feasibility to this approach. 

10. Will the project consider a remotely located consultant (i.e. out of state) for assessment of data and report generation activities or is 100% of the work expected to be performed onsite at the specified place of performance?   

Answer - This project must substantially be conducted at the place of performance, which is at the FDA facility. In some instances, data assessment and report generation could be worked on remotely (i.e., out of state).
