<DESC>It is the intent of the Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to procure professional services on a sole source basis from Margaret A. Douglas, Maryland.  The purpose of this procurement is to acquire management and fiscal analysis support services for CIT in carrying out its responsibilities related to implementing the Government Performance and Results Act and the Clinger-Cohen Act, implementing IT policies and Departmental directives, conducting annual program reviews and developing the CIT budget projections and related documents.  The period of performance is for 12 months with one 12-month option period.  

Specifically, the contractor shall: (1) Provide support to CIT management for the annual program review and development of the CIT budget and related Strategic Business Plan; 2) Design and analyze a process for developing Employee Performance Contracts; 3) Provide support to the Director, OPEC for A-76 activities.; 4) Provide support to the CFO, CIT and the Director, OPEC in coordinating budget analysis and review activities; 5) Provide support for the annual CIT Critical Infrastructure Protection reporting; 6)  Provide support to the Executive Officer (EO), CFO, and the Director of OPEC in preparing draft responses to Departmental directives and reporting requirements.

CIT has determined that Ms. Douglas is uniquely qualified to provide the above services.  She possesses a unique combination of knowledge, skills, abilities, and understanding of the CIT organization’s management and budget needs which will allow her to successfully accomplish the specified tasks.  She has a total of 37 years of Federal experience, 36 of them in CIT and its predecessor organizations.  Her significant scientific and computing knowledge is supplemented with 20 years of experience with information resource management, strategic planning, developing new IT management processes, IT portfolio management, IT investment review, and acquisition approval processes in compliance with new legislation; developing a new NIH software licensing policy and pilot plan; developing guidelines for internal controls; participating in the development of the CIT mission, vision, business areas, and goals and drafting the related documents; providing IT acquisition oversight; collaborating IT Investment Review planning, evaluation and process development; and developing long-term and short term plans and timelines.  She has experience in large IT contracting activities, assisting in planning and providing consultation and support for large, critical IT acquisitions, providing information, advice, and assistance to CIT managers; and evaluating large CIT IT acquisitions for compliance with applicable IT policies and regulations.  She had a leadership role in large Trail Boss acquisitions, with emphasis on those proposed acquisitions that are critical to the CIT mission, sensitive, complex or represent substantial commitment of resources.  She drafted the Computer Equipment, Resources and Technology Acquisition for NIH (CERTAN) Information Technology Support Services (ITSS) SOW, managing ITSS vendor questions and comments, and designing and overseeing the first large past performance data acquisition and analysis under the new post-Brooks Act legislation [writing a “lessons learned” report for the Fleet Industrial Supply Center, Norfolk, Detachment Washington (FISC), GSA, and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy].  She served as Deputy Trail Boss in charge of the CERTAN Network Infrastructure acquisition.  CIT has determined that based upon his previous experience and expertise, Ms. Douglas will not require orientation to CIT's organization, activities, and services; IT architecture; strategic planning; program and related fiscal planning; and NIH budgetary structures, and is the only source with the unique qualifications who can successfully accomplish the specified tasks.   

This proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 -- Acquisition of Commercial Items.  This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available.  However, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner that will be considered by the Government.  Sources interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide convincing evidence that they possess the requisite expertise and experience to successfully perform the services as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fourteen (14) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposals must include pricing information.  This requirement is being processed for CIT by NIH’s National Library of Medicine (NLM) which serves as CIT’s acquisition service center.  NLM Synopsis No. NLM 04-057/NSD.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to Neha Dhir on 301-496-6127.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Boulder City Regional Office, Boulder City, Nevada, intends to award on a sole source basis a purchase order to Fassett Consulting LLC, Cheyenne, WY  82003.  As the former Wyoming State Engineer, Mr. Fassett has extensive knowledge of State legislative processes, knows how State agencies conduct their operations, has experience administering State laws, and has established and maintained effective working relationships with the key decision makers in the other State agencies with whom he will need to consult with to research and identify groundwater management and accounting practices that may help the Lower Colorado Region address its unauthorized use problem.  Mr. Fassett's credibility in working on counterparts in the Basin States will give him access to sensitive information that might be withheld from an outsider.  Mr. Fassett has gained a solid working knowledge of the issues, laws, policies, and practices that relate to Colorado River water use in the Lower Basin from his recent work as a consultant for Reclamation on two projects, the Yuma Island panel and 43 CFR part 417 consultations.  Considering the time and cost of educating a new consultant in Lower Basin matters, it is considered to be in the best interest of the Government to award a contract to Mr. Fassett.  This procurement will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition procedures.  The anticipated award date is January 7, 2004.  All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency.  Offers shall show Contractor's capability to provide the required work and quotes are to be submitted no later than January 5, 2004, 4:00 p.m., PST.

<DESC>The objective of the EQZ Supplemental Housing Certificate Program is to issue certificates to as many of remaining approximately 600 domic-dwelling families in Gyumri as possible. The USAID EQZ Recovery Program was designed to assist the Government of Armenia (GOAM) to meet its stated obligation to compensate households which lost public housing in the 1988 earthquake, have not been compensated, and continue to live in temporary shelter.  The best estimate of the EQZ Recovery Program contractor, Urban Institute, is that upon completion of the ongoing housing certificate issuance under the current contract, there will remain in the city of Gyumri, approximately 600 families who meet the program eligibility criteria, and physically reside in domics (trailers or shipping containers intended to provide temporary shelter to families who lost their homes in the 1988 earthquake.)  The applications for these families have been collected by The Urban Institute program staff, but will not be processed under the existing contract due to lack of necessary funds to issue them housing certificates.  

The contractor will be obligated to complete the processing of the applications for housing certificates collected in the city of Gyumri remaining at the completion of the EQZ Recovery Program in July 2004, identify those applicant households currently residing in domics in the city of Gyumri, and issue housing certificates of values corresponding to the housing space requirements for the households, to the extent allowed by available funding.  Once issued, the contractor will manage the redemption process as per the procedures established under the EQZ Recovery Program, and ensure that funds are transferred to the bank accounts of, first the certificate recipient, then the seller, as per the terms of the sales contract.  Ownership title to the purchased property is to be issued/registered to the beneficiary family. The contractor must complete program close-out by December 31, 2004. The total program budget is estimated to be approximately $2.7-3 million including the cost of 500 housing certificates.

<DESC>Description
The Department of Health and Human Services, National Vaccine Program Office, contemplates single or multiple awards of a contract for a domestically produced, reliable and secure source of cell based monovalent influenza vaccine for use in an influenza pandemic.

Because this could be an issue of health security for any country and that local supplies of influenza vaccine might be reserved for local populations, as an issue of health security the U.S. government is limiting manufacture of the pandemic influenza virus vaccine to domestic sources only.  This would allow the USG to have surge capacity for U.S. citizens in the setting of a global influenza pandemic
 
The following apply:

1.	Documented history of successful development and licensure of a vaccine for human use in the U.S. or Europe is mandatory.
2.	The research and development process and manufacturing facilities needed to satisfy regulatory requirements of the FDA.
3.	The pandemic virus will be a novel strain, such as the avian influenza viruses (H5N1) that infected people in Hong Kong in 1997 and in China in 2003, or the H7N7 strain that caused infections in Belgium and the Netherlands in 2003.

Only written requests, directly from the requestor, will be accepted.  Email requests will be accepted.  No telephone requests will be accepted.  Requests should reference the solicitation number, state the name of the firm, name of the requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, and email address.

It also virtually displays the force and path at the center of gravity in any plain.  The static support force, which is invisible to the naked eye is projected onto the body using a diffuse laser beam.  This makes it possible to check body posture or the static alignment of orthopedic appliances or aids while they are on the patient.  The L.A.S.A.R. Assembly uses three line lasers to project the alignment line in the sagittal and frontal views.  The knee joint is secured in the device with special support according  to the stipulated alignment values and mounted to the prosthetic foot and corresponding adapters.  The L.A.S.A.R. Assembly permits measurable and reproducible three-dimensional of components in modular leg prosthesis, it is also possible to measure finished modular leg prosthesis for follow up fittings and be used to precisely align leg and spinal arthoses.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has issued a new Draft Solicitation for performing environmental remediation services to close the Hanford Site River Corridor, approximately 210 square miles of the Hanford Site along the Columbia River in Southeastern Washington.  The new Draft Solicitation is issued to support exchanges with industry. In March 2002, DOE issued Solicitation DE-RP06-02RL14300 for only a portion of the scope required to close the Hanford Site River Corridor.  Following release of the Solicitation DE-RP06-02RL14300, DOE evaluated its current programmatic needs.  The new Draft Solicitation now provides for full closure of the Hanford Site River Corridor using a performance-based approach that provides the flexibility and incentives to achieve innovative, safe, efficient, and measurable results. DOE believes that cancellation of Solicitation DE-RP06-02RL14300 is appropriate given the substantial change in programmatic requirements.  DOE will make a decision regarding cancellation of Solicitation DE-RP06-02RL14300 following planned exchanges with industry. There will be two opportunities for exchanges with industry.  The first opportunity is for interested industry sources to provide written comments on the new Draft Solicitation.  Industry comments are requested by January 17, 2004.  The second opportunity is for interested industry sources to participate in one-on-one meetings to be held in Richland, Washington during the week of January 13, 2004.  Interested firms are strongly encouraged to participate in these exchanges with industry. Questions or inquiries about this new Draft Solicitation, including requests to participate in the information exchanges with industry, should be sent by e-mail to Michael K. Barrett, Contracting Officer, River Corridor Closure Contract Source Evaluation Board at Michael_K_Barrett@RL.gov

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy, Savannah River Operations Office (SR), near Aiken, South Carolina, intends to negotiate a Sole Source procurement with Parsons.  Parsons is currently completing Title II design activities for the design and construction of the new Glass Waste Storage Building.  The new requirement is to provide Title III engineering services for the design that will be issued for construction in late January 2004.  In addition to Title III requirements, Parsons may provide some incidental services such as quality control and configuration management services associated with the design during the construction phase of the project.  This is a Sole Source Procurement and is not a request for competitive quotes.  The statutory authority under FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Title III design activities will require the design firm to provide a Professional Engineering certification to any changes to the design.  SR?s research indicates that only the original design firm can certify changes without duplicating calculations that will have negative impacts to cost and schedule.  Otherwise qualified firms that believe they can provide Title III services without a negative impact to the project must respond to this notice prior to close of business on Wednesday, January 7, 2004. Offerors responding to this notice must demonstrate their ability to provide an equivalent service, rationale as to why they should be considered and demonstrate that bringing in another Title III contractor does not impact cost or schedule.  Interested parties should contact the U.S. Department of Energy, ATTN: Donna Anderson, P.O. Box A, Aiken, South Carolina 29802; via facsimile to Ms. Anderson at (803) 952-9252; or via e-mail to donna.anderson@srs.gov.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Eastern Administrative Support Center (EASC), within the U.S. Department of Commerce, seeks to award a performance-based contract to acquire technical support services for the NOAA Coastal Services Center (CSC) in Charleston, South Carolina, a subunit of the National Ocean Service (NOS).  This contract will provide the resources needed to continue services currently under contract.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this contract is 541690 (NAICS U.S. Industry Title - Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services).  The services will support the Director's Office (DO) and the three CSC service areas: Coastal Information Services (CIS), Coastal Management Services (CMS), and Resource Management Services (RMS).  The DO is responsible for general management, administration, strategic and operational planning, partnership building, program evaluation, Integrated Ocean Observing Systems activities, and budget oversight of CSC.  CIS houses CSC's data management, data analysis, programming, and geospatial product development capabilities. CMS helps develop the abilities of state and local coastal resource managers and planners to perform their duties. RMS is responsible for the business operations of CSC.  RMS ensures that CSC executes its mission in compliance with regulations and is the liaison with the NOS Office of Management and Budget and EASC.  For the purpose of this acquisition, NOAA EASC will use a streamlined acquisition process entitled Concept of Operations, or CONOPS (summary information available at www.csc.noaa.gov/conops/ and detailed information available at http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/conops/tools/).  Within the overall framework of the CONOPS process, NOAA will be using the Small Business Cascading Evaluation Preference Process, a streamlining process that has been endorsed by the Small Business Administration and has been used successfully by several federal agencies.  The cascading approach permits the government to continue the acquisition process without disruption in the event a sufficient number of qualified small businesses are not achieved in the first or second phase of the acquisition.  In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 19.5, any award for technical support services resulting from this solicitation, will be made on a competitive basis to eligible small business concerns, provided that a minimum of two (2) competitive (technical and cost) offers are received from qualified small business concerns that can fulfill the project objective.  If a minimum of two (2) offers from qualified small business concerns are not received for the services specified within the solicitation, the award will be made on the basis of a "full and open" competition from among all the responsible businesses submitting offers.  This acquisition project will be carried out in two phases. Phase I will include an initial down-selection to determine the availability of sources capable of providing the services required by the CSC. Phase II will include issuance of a Statement of Need (SON) and award. The SON will be developed based on the results of Phase I.  Now available on the Internet at http://www.csc.noaa.gov/conops is the Project Agreement that provides the scope of this project, the tentative schedule for the acquisition, and the request for information. In utilizing this acquisition process, the Project Agreement will serve as the solicitation document for this requirement. Interested parties must respond to the Project Agreement in order to be considered for award of a resulting contract. The Government will issue the SON to the down-selected vendors by posting it on the same website as the Project Agreement.  Questions shall be directed to the Acquisition Team, Attn: Michelle Morales via e-mail Michelle.R.Morales@noaa.gov. Answers to questions received will be disseminated utilizing the Internet and posted at http://www.csc.noaa.gov/conops.  Requests for a printed copy of the Project Agreement may be obtained by written request to Michelle Morales, Norfolk Federal Bldg., Room 815, 200 Granby Street, Norfolk, VA 23510. Fax number (757) 441-3786.

    Statement of Work 
For FY 2004 NCOA Bus Contract
Period of Performance – 3 January 2004 thru 29 October 2004

SERVICES, NON-PERSONAL:  Contractor will provide a 75 passenger, Double Decker coach to transport Air Force personnel and dependents (and their luggage) from RAF Mildenhall, Suffolk to the NCO Academy at Kapaun AS, Germany (vicinity of Kaiserslautern, GE) and return.  All passengers can expect to be traveling with 2-3 full size pieces of luggage, none of which can be stowed in the passenger area.  Luggage is a major consideration and the contractor will ensure it can be stowed and transported in the bus or in the trailer (there needs to be a luggage trailer with every trip made to and from the NCOA).  The contractor will ensure that the coach is of the highest caliber (Executive class or higher), with a partial table and facing seat configuration on the lower level.  It must be equipped with video/movie capability, including multiple TV screens and a sound system other than just the TV speaker, all in good working order.  At least three movies suitable for general viewing will be played in each direction at no additional charge to the riders (the same movies will not be shown in each direction).  A fully functional water closet is required that does not impose usage limits on the passengers.  Water, coffee, tea, and hot chocolate will be made available to all the passengers, at no cost to the passengers.  The contractor will ensure that at least two rest stops of not less than 30 minutes each are made between RAF Mildenhall and Kapaun AS.  Passengers must be afforded the opportunity to disembark from the coach at rest stops, and the selected rest areas must provide restroom facilities and moderately priced dining facilities.  The contractor will instruct the driver(s) that smoking within 15 feet of the coach entrance (including continental doors) is not allowed.  Travel delays at the Channel crossing point do not count as one of the required two stops (the coach must travel on the Channel Ferry when crossing the English Channel).  Should the coach encounter mechanical difficulties that impair the safe or timely transport of the passengers in either direction, the contractor will (at their expense) immediately coordinate a replacement coach of equal or higher quality and equipment (which will be subject to the same conditions).  The contractor will ensure all regulatory requirements regarding driving hours, safety equipment, etc., are complied with, as well as ensuring the driver(s) is thoroughly familiar with the route and emergency contact procedures along the way.  The contractor will ensure that the driver(s) carries a Europe wide capable mobile phone for emergency use by him on all parts of the journey, and will allow the Troop Commander use of the phone, approximately 30-minutes drive time from Kapaun AS, for the purpose of arranging an escort for the bus upon arrival.


Description of Travel Dates and Pick-up Points

1.  On the Blue dates below the coach will depart from the Long Term Parking Lot on RAF Mildenhall, at 1900 hrs, and deliver the passengers one-way (drop off) to Kapaun AS, Germany.  Once the coach arrives at Vogelweh AB, it will proceed to the Vogelweh Billeting Office where the passengers will process into their rooms.  Once everyone has signed for their rooms, the passengers will once again board the coach and proceed to the NCOA at Kapaun As, for the final delivery of the passengers.  The bus will then return (empty) to the United Kingdom. 

2.  On the Red dates below the coach will pick up invited guests for the graduation ceremony, departing from the Long term Parking Lot on RAF Mildenhall at 1900 hrs, and transport them and their luggage to Kapaun AS, Germany, in time to attend the NCOA graduation (approximately 0800 hrs)

3.  On the Green dates below the coach will depart Kapaun AS, Germany, at 0700 hrs to return both the invited guests and the graduates, with their luggage, to the Long Term Parking Lot on RAF Mildenhall.

4.  For the sake of clarity, a ‘trip’ will be considered all runs associated with an individual class.  Therefore, a ‘trip’ will consist of a roundtrip (Blue) and a roundtrip/return (Red and Green combined).  The FY 2004 schedule will include six (6) trips.

The FACT additionally will be built and tested in accordance with the government specification provided with the solicitation.  It is anticipated the boats will be delivered eight months after contract award.  The government intends to award two contracts for one FACT each on a best value basis to the two highest rated offers, considering all source selection criteria, submitted in response to the solicitation.  It is anticipated the solicitation will be issued on or about 13 October 2003 and will be available through the 2.0 Contracts Competency home pages at: https://contracts.nawcwd.navy.mil/rfp-nawc.htm.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be furnished unless absolutely necessary. The anticipated due date for proposals is 14 November 2003; however, the actual proposal due date will be stated in the solicitation when issued. Proposal must be written in English and all costs proposed must be in US dollars.

The project’s purpose is to stabilize the coulee which is the outlet from Polk County Ditch 19 at Highway 220.  The proposed design concept calls for installing a structure which passes the water directly into the Red River from the east end of the coulee, without allowing the water to proceed down the remainder of the coulee to the present outlet to the Red River of the North.  The goals are to avoid further erosion, stabilize the coulee, convey water safely to the Red River, and protect the Sandhill church and cemetery, and the land owned by two adjacent landowners.  

The contract is expected to involve several investigations in addition to the design and construction oversight of the hydraulic structure.  These may include, but are not limited to: 
1) a fluvial geomorphology assessment of the Red River to assure a stable outlet, 
2) a geotechnical analysis of the soils, 
3) a detailed survey of the project area, 
4) soil mechanics analysis, 
5) hydrology and hydraulics modeling, 
6) design of a full flow grade stabilization structure with a potential drop of 25 to 35 feet, and 
7) construction oversight of the entire project.

The estimated starting date is March 1, 2004, and the expected delivery for the design plans and specifications is November 1, 2004.  The expected completion date for the contract is November 1, 2005, after the project is constructed.  The contract will be a firm-fixed price contract.  The estimated value of the construction project is between $1 million and $5 million.  Funding is through the NRCS EQIP program.

Those firms that meet the requirements described and wish to be considered must submit an SF330 to Steve Muyskens, Contract Specialist, Natural Resources Conservation Service, 375 Jackson Street, Suite 600, St. Paul, MN 55101.  It must be received in this office no later than 4 p.m. on the 30th calendar day after the date of appearance of this announcement in FedBizOpps.  Should the due date fall on a weekend or holiday, the SF330 will be due the first workday thereafter. The SF330 must clearly indicate the office location where the work will be performed and the qualifications of the individuals and subcontractors proposed to work on the contract and their geographical location.

Firms responding to this announcement before the closing date will be considered for selection, subject to any limitations indicated with respect to size and geographic location of the firm, specialized technical expertise, or other requirements listed.  Following an initial evaluation of the qualification and performance data submitted, three or more firms considered to be the most highly qualified to provide the type of services required will be chosen for negotiation. 

Selection of firms for negotiation shall be through an order of preference based upon demonstrated competence and qualifications necessary for the satisfactory performance of the type of professional services required. All firms responding to this announcement will be evaluated on the following factors which are shown is descending order of importance.  
1.	Professional capabilities;
2.	Specialized experience and technical competence, including soil mechanics, hydrology, hydraulics, surveying, structure design, construction oversight, and other as required;
3.	Capacity to accomplish work in the required time;
4.	Past performance on contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules;
5.	Quality control experience;
6.	Geographical location and knowledge of the locality of the project, provided that the application of the criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project; and
7.	Experience with NRCS standards and specifications.

Firms must provide a customer reference list with addresses and telephone numbers, and bidding records (low bid vs. estimate) for all projects listed as related experience, and a project workload schedule showing proposed team members for the project period.

<DESC>This solicitation is being offered to encourage interested parties to develop a dispersal system mounted on a helicopter to apply Disrupt II (pheromone flakes) using Gelva 2333 as a sticker.  Current technology for applying the pheromone flakes and sticker is the Hercon pod mounted on fixed-wing aircraft (Air Tractor).  Due to availability of the components and the complexity of the pods, there is a need to develop flake dispersal systems using technology that is more readily available.  The dispersal system must be designed, built and mounted on a helicopter and meet the criteria i.e. calibration and characterization, before it will be considered for use under this solicitation.  Three thousand acres, referred to as test blocks, have been set aside by the Government for the express purpose of field testing a helicopter dispersal system that shows promise but lacks adequate field testing for use in operational programs.  Potential test blocks may be located in the following states:  Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois.  Application is expected to occur sometime between mid June to early July 2004.  Only one application of the mating disruptant will be applied at rates from 34 grams to 170 grams per acre with a calibrated rate of sticker.  All technical questions should be addressed to Donna Leonard at 828-257-4329 or DeeDee Sellers at 540-432-8245.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541330   NAICS Code: 541330 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Dynamic Solutions, LLC., P.O. Box 24176 Knoxville, TN 37933-2176. The ERD (Ecosystems Research Division) plans  to release in March 2004 for distribution through the CEAM (Center for Environmental Assessment Modeling) the Environmental Fluids Dynamic Code (EFDC). EFDC is a public domain three dimensional hydrodynamic, sediment and toxic transport and eutrophication model whose development has been supported  by Regions 1 and 4, OW/OST (Office of Water/Office of Science and Technology, and ORD/NERL/ERD. EFDC can be used in developing TMDL'S (Total Maximum Dailey Loads) for impacted surface waters when modeling is deemed necessary. EFDC can also be used to determine the transport and fate of contaminants  (e.g., PCBs, metals) in contaminated surface waters, and thus can be used to evaluate proposed remediation alternatives at Superfund sites with contaminated sediments (e.g.) Hudson River, Lower Fox River, Housatonic River, Lake Hartwell).The EFDC-Explorer, which is a pre-and post-processor for EFDC  that operates on Windows operating systems, will be distributed free of charge with the EFDC to assist the Regions and states in the application of EFDC. This purchase order is for the performance of the following tasks: 1)Update the users manual for the EFDC-Explorer program to include a  description of the numerous developments in EFDC-Explorer since the first version of the user manual was published in July 2003. 2) Develop capability to view vertical profiles (along a user chosen transect line) of flow velocities & other state variables such as temperature, salinity, and  suspended sediment concentrations, similar to the existing capability to view water surface profiles along a specified grid row or column. 3)Develop the capability to calculate and view  (and output the data to text files) discharge time series at user specified transects that shows the magnitude  of the discharge as well as the sign (to indicate flow direction in oscillatory flows).  4) Develop the capability to view time series of: a) bedload fluxes through segment interfaces; b) grain-related shear stress; and c) POC-sorbed, DOC-complexed, and freely dissolved PCB concentrations. 5)  Verify that the mass balance routines in EFDC_Explorer works with the current version of EFDC. 6) Provide support to the EPA Project Officer in the use of EFDC-Explorer. The support shall take the form of fixing minor bugs (if discovered) in EFDC-Explorer and responding to  questions from the  Project Officer in the use of EFDC Explorer. Dynamic Solutions, LLC developed EFDC_Explorer, which is a Visual Basic Pre- and Post-Processor for EFDC, for Region 4 and the Office of Water and delivered the executable file to these offices. This additional development of EFDC_Explorer is needed to  increase the usability of EFDC (which is a three-dimensional hydrodynamic, sediment and toxics transport, and eutrophication model that the CEAM is scheduled to release in March 2004) by the Regions and States in the development of TMDLs.  Since Dynamic Solutions, LLC is the developer of  EFDC_Explorer, they possess the unique capabilities required to complete the required tasks, therefore they are the only responsible source qualified to perform the specified tasks in a timely fashion and stay within a reasonable cost to satisfy the requirements.  Also, since Dynamic Solutions, LLC  is the developer of the source code, they have patent rights and other sources  would require permission from Dynamic Solutions to purchase and modify the source code (which is essential for the completion of the required work). Therefore the EPA has identified Dynamic Solutions, LLC., as the only  vendor capable of satisfying the requirement. The circumstance permitting "other than full and open competition" is FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source  exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) will be issued.  Interested parties who can meet the above requirements and qualifications may  submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability and how they would be useful in performing this requirement no later than 15 days after the date of this publication.

This purchase order is for the performance of the following tasks:  1)Update the users manual for the EFDC-Explorer program to include a description of the numerous developments in EFDC-Explorer since the first version of the user manual was published in July 2003. 2) Develop capability to view vertical profiles (along a user chosen transect line) of flow  velocities & other state variables such as temperature, salinity, and suspended sediment concentrations, similar to the existing capability to view water surface profiles along a specified grid row or column. 3)Develop the capability to calculate and view  (and output the data to text files)  discharge time series at user specified transects that shows the magnitude of the discharge as well as the sign (to indicate flow direction in oscillatory flows).  4) Develop the capability to view time series of: a) bedload fluxes through segment interfaces; b) grain-related shear stress; and c)  POC-sorbed, DOC-complexed, and freely dissolved PCB concentrations. 5) Verify that the mass balance routines in EFDC_Explorer works with the current version of EFDC. 6) Provide support to the EPA Project Officer in the use of EFDC-Explorer. The support shall take the form of fixing minor bugs (if  discovered) in EFDC-Explorer and responding to  questions from the Project Officer in the use of EFDC Explorer. Dynamic Solutions, LLC developed EFDC_Explorer, which is a Visual Basic Pre- and Post-Processor for EFDC, for Region 4 and the Office of Water and delivered the executable file to these  offices. This additional development of EFDC_Explorer is needed to increase the usability of EFDC (which is a three-dimensional hydrodynamic, sediment and toxics transport, and eutrophication model that the CEAM is scheduled to release in March 2004) by the Regions and States in the development of  TMDLs.  Since Dynamic Solutions, LLC is the developer of EFDC_Explorer, they possess the unique capabilities required to complete the required tasks, therefore they are the only responsible source qualified to perform the specified tasks in a timely fashion and stay within a reasonable cost to  satisfy the requirements.  Also, since Dynamic Solutions, LLC is the developer of the source code, they have patent rights and other sources  would require permission from Dynamic Solutions to purchase and modify the source code (which is essential for the completion of the required work).  Therefore the EPA has identified Dynamic Solutions, LLC., as the only vendor capable of satisfying the requirement. The circumstance permitting "other than full and open competition" is FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source  exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) will be issued.  Interested  parties who can meet the above requirements and qualifications may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability and how they would be useful in performing this requirement no later than 15 days after the date of this publication.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, intends to award a sole-source, firm-fixed price contract to FN Herstal, Belgium for the procurement of 24 M3M .50 caliber crew-served defensive weapon systems (CDWS) common to U.S. Navy and Marine Corps assault support rotary-wing aircraft.  The M3M .50 caliber weapon system will include the following:  a CH-53E rear mount, an Interface for CH-53E Rear Mounted Weapon System (RMWS), a M3M/MPH Took Kit for Operators, M3M/MPH Tool Kit for Armorers, a Periodic Replacement Parts (PRP) Kit, a Regular Replacement Part (RRP) Kits, M3M/CDWS Manuals (FFP – Operation/Maintenance/Illustrated Parts Breakdown, M3M Catalog Parts and Accessories, M3M Operator’s Manual, M3M Maintenance Manual), an M3M RMWS Training Manual, and Training (Armorer/Operator).   Pintle mounted .50 Caliber Machine Guns for the system will be provided as GFE.  The system will be capable of a rate of fire greater than 1000 rounds per minute, a desired barrel life of 10,000 rounds, weapon depot level maintenance required no earlier than 40,000 rounds, the capability to use 100, 300 or 600 round ammunition cans, the capability to fire all standard NATO .50 Caliber ammunition to include SABOT ammunition, a total system weight similar to the XM-218 system with no greater than a thirty percent increase in weight allowed, the ability to maintain or increase the available fields of fire for each airframe, and the capability for dismounted operation by 1 person within 2 minutes.  In addition, the weapon system will be capable of being mounted on each of the following platforms: CH-46, CH-53, H-60, and MV-22 aircraft to include left and right door mounts for all platforms, a ramp mount for the CH-53, and integration on to the Improved Defensive Armament System (IDAS) for the UH-1 aircraft. The weapon system will include compatibility with Night Vision Device (NVD) capable targeting, pointing and illuminating laser systems.  A soft pintle mount for airframe stress reduction, improved targeting, and improved accuracy will also be included.  The operation of the weapon, along with the ammunition handling, feed, and storage system will not require electrical power from the aircraft or any other source.  The scope of the Common Defensive Weapon System (CDWS) contract shall include all of the efforts necessary to manufacture and deliver the 24 systems.  In addition, Herstal will design and develop the actual interface between airframe and weapon system.  This contract will be issued on a sole source basis to FN Herstal, the sole designer, developer and manufacturer of the M3M.

<DESC>Notice of Intent: Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, “Only One Responsible source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements”, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is planning to issue a sole-source contract to enable the OPM to obtain technical and administrative assistance from Ms. Oceola Y. Briscoe in support of the Agency’s efforts to manage and efficiently improve the adjudication of the equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaints of discrimination and the presentation of all aspects of the EEO program as it relates to a variety of audiences. The Center for Equal Employment Opportunity (CEEO) has a recurring need for various services related to the substantial and procedural issues of the administrative EEO process as required by 29 CFR 1614 and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) Management Directive 110. The contractor must provide advice and technical assistance, and develop policies and procedures for carrying out program goals and initiatives.  The CEEO has an extremely important responsibility for processing complaints of discrimination based on race, religion, sex (including sexual harassment), national origin, age, disability (mental	and physical) and reprisal, affirmative employment goals and objectives and meeting the President’s Management Agenda.  Based on the restructuring of the CEEO and its new responsibilities, the complaint processing workload has increased for the limited staff available.  A critical backlog of discrimination complaints continues to exist which increases a need for outside assistance with technical knowledge for the Federal EEO process with a specialized emphasis for processing formal EEO cases  Ms. Briscoe possesses unique experience and expertise derived from her working relationship and experience in the EEO office at OPM.  As a former long time OPM employee, she fully understands the goals, the mission, and the culture of the Agency.  She processes a wealth of knowledge and skills needed to accomplish OPM’s mission and purpose of the Federal EEO Program at OPM..  Her technical knowledge and professionalism is irreplaceable.  Most federal agency EEO Programs have many subcomponents.  The OPM CEEO is a one stop shop and is responsible for processing complaints, implementing EEO policy, and monitoring affirmative employment programs to promote equal opportunity and to identify and eliminate discriminatory practices and policies.  
OPM deems it appropriate to award a fixed-price contract on other 	than a full and open competitive basis.  Only one responsible source is available and no other types of 	services will satisfy the needs of the Agency.  The North American Standard Industrial 	Classification System (NAICS) Code for action is 561499, All Other Business Support Services, with a small business standard of $6.0 million.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS OR AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, NOR DOES IT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  Interested parties having all the capabilities to perform the services described above are requested to submit capability statements, limited to not more than 5 pages, to be received within 15 days of publication of this Notice to: U. S.

<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency plans to release a Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) on or about 10 January 2004. Research and Development is being sought in the Topic Area of Individual Protection. This Topic Areas is briefly described below.  Multiple awards are possible. 
Individual Protection. The objective is to develop personnel chemical protection technologies, e.g. clothing, materials, prophylaxes, masks, respiratory systems, cooling technologies, isolation systems, that better protect, maximize operational efficiency, and minimize personnel fatigue in a chemical warfare and/or toxic industrial chemical environment.  The primary chemical warfare agents of interest include the multiple variants of G-type nerve agents, V-type nerve agents, non-traditional agents, vesicants, blood agents, choking agents and incapacitating agents.  The ability to address non-traditional agents and toxic industrial chemicals should be specifically identified.  Protection from these materials will be required to meet a variety of missions, including attack response, assessment, inspection, decontamination, etc.  The development of individual protection equipment must balance the breadth in mission needs and agent properties with the logistical burdens of personnel donning/doffing and working in inhospitable environments.  The Joint Service Lightweight Integrated Suit Technology (JSLIST) should be considered the baseline technology for personnel protection. Technological advancements are needed for individual chemical protection in the areas of clothing materials, masks, lifetime indicators, cooling technologies, isolation systems, etc.  This listing is not meant to be inclusive; any system or aspect of personnel protection for potentially lethal chemical environments will be considered.   The new technologies and/or methods should directly address the problems associated with wearing protective equipment, including physiological strains, logistical encumbrance, and equipment compatibility.  
Specific information regarding the format of submissions, contents, schedules, and evaluation criteria will be provided with the PRDA.  The estimated release date is 10 January 2004.  This announcement in no way commits the Government to issue a solicitation or to make contract award(s).

<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency plans to release a  Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) on or about 10 January 2004. Research and Development is being sought in three Topic Areas: 1) Sample Collection and Transport, 2) Chemical Warfare Agent and Toxic Industrial Chemical Detection, and  3) Chemical Warfare Agent and Toxic Industrial Chemical Identification. Each of the Topic Areas is briefly described below.  
1.  Chemical Agent Sample Collection and Transport. The objective is to obtain methods and containers for the collection and transport of chemicals over an extended period (weeks to months) while maintaining sample integrity, to obtain accurate data for detection, analysis, and attribution.  Both active and passive technologies for sampling chemicals (agents, precursors, decomposition products, general toxic industrial chemicals, etc.) are required for personnel monitoring devices (chronic and acute), detectors, characterization tools, etc. Since the physical properties of the potential chemicals of interest vary dramatically (e.g. low to high vapor pressures) collection methods and sample containers must be designed that can allow for the reversible sequestering of agents that are in a gaseous, liquid and/or solid state. In addition to the physical characteristics of the pure sample, the matrix from which the sample could be taken is very diverse (gases, liquids or solids in the environment or in open, sealed or pressurized vessels).   The sample containers must be lightweight, man-portable, rugged, chemically inert and able to withstand temperature extremes (-20 to 130 F). The training requirements that accompany the technologies must be nominal and the containers and methods should account for the reduced dexterity, which results from personnel protection equipment (e.g., gloves, respirators, isolation suits).
2. Chemical Warfare Agent and Toxic Industrial Chemical Detection. The objective is to develop state of the art detectors for gaseous, liquid and solid chemical agents and toxic industrial chemical that can operate in a variety of environments and matrices. For this synopsis, detection is limited to the simple determination of the presence and location of chemical warfare agents, precursors, decomposition products, and/or toxic industrial chemicals at predetermined levels.  The chemical warfare agents of interest include the multiple variants of G-type nerve agents, V-type nerve agents, non-traditional agents, vesicants, blood agents, choking agents and incapacitating agents.  Detection of these agents, their precursors, degradation products and toxic industrial chemicals will be required to meet a variety of needs, including protection, inspection, verification and attribution. The detectors must be designed to be rapid, reliable (low maintenance), accurate, easy to use, man-portable, ruggedized, and lightweight.  The detectors should also have low power requirements and integrate systems for self-calibration, self-standardization and alarms, e.g. visual, audible or some combination.  If libraries are used, access to the database should be designed into the architecture for edits and additions by the users. 
3. Chemical Warfare Agent and Toxic Industrial Chemical Identification. The objective is to develop identification systems with enhanced resolution and reliability that can quickly and accurately characterize unknown samples suspected of containing chemical warfare agents and toxic industrial chemicals.  For this announcement, identification is a method and/or technology used to accurately determine specific chemical constituents, revealing the full characteristics (molecular-level) of the chemicals.  Since the technology should be able to fully characterize most of the chemical warfare agents and toxic industrial chemicals in any physical form or from any matrix, it is presumed that more complex systems will be required.  Desirable identification systems are man-portable, ruggedized, light weight, near real-time, easily decontaminated, and have low power requirements. 
	Specific information regarding the format of submissions, contents, schedules, and evaluation criteria will be provided with the posting of the PRDA.  The estimated release date is 10 January 2004.  This announcement in no way commits the Government to issue a solicitation or to make contract award(s).

<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency plans to release a  Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) on or about 10 January 2004. Research and Development is being sought in two Topic Areas: 1) Chemical Agent Defeat and 2) Decontamination Technologies and Methods. Each of the Topic Areas is briefly described below. Multiple awards are anticipated.  
 1. Chemical Agent Defeat:  The objective is to develop fast-acting and lightweight systems that deny, render useless, neutralize, or otherwise destroy chemical agents and toxic industrial chemicals.  For this announcement denying the utility of chemical agents and toxic industrial chemicals generally refers to removing or mitigating the actual chemical hazard through chemical or physical means.  The chemical warfare agents of interest span multiple variants of G-type nerve agents, V-type nerve agents, non-traditional agents, vesicants, blood agents, choking agents and incapacitating agents.  Technologies and methods are required that can address this breadth of properties, be able to destroy the chemicals in the presence and absence of other organic compounds, and be independent of the concentration of the agent of interest.   As a result, the development of novel materials, delivery systems and methods are being sought.  
2. Decontamination Technologies and Methods:  The objective is to develop decontamination technologies and methods of chemical warfare agents and toxic industrial chemicals that are lightweight, rapid and can address multi-faceted missions, including personnel, sensitive equipment, electronics, vehicles, infrastructure, etc.  Decontamination methods must be capable of removing chemical species from people and the surfaces/sub-surfaces of materials.  Advancements in decontamination technologies and methods are required such that lightweight, rapid, and easy to use systems can be deployed.  
Specific information regarding the format of submissions, contents, schedules, and evaluation criteria will be provided with the PRDA. The estimated release date for the PRDA is 10 January 2004.  This announcement in no way commits the Government to issue a solicitation or to make contract award(s).

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>A solicitation will be issued for selection of Design/Build firms using a Staged Two-Phase selection procedure approach to achieve the negotiation and award of Design/Build contracts during a period of five (5) years.  Typical projects to be designed  and constructed under contracts using this approach may include but are not limited to family housing, dormitories, dining facilities, bachelor and visiting officer quarters, child care facilities, fitness/health and wellness centers, education buildings,  chapels, and similar residential and non-industrial type buildings.  Contracts may be awarded for projects generally within the geographic boundaries of the Southwestern Division of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which includes primarily the states of Oklahoma, Texas, and Arkansas, and is supported by the Tulsa, Fort Worth, Galveston, and Little Rock Districts.  Contracts may also be awarded by other Corps of Engineer districts to support any and all Southwestern Division customers located in geographic al areas outside the Southwestern Division boundaries. As per FAR Subpart 36.3, the acquisition process will consist of two stages to accomplish both phases of the two-phase selection procedures for the award of Design/Build contracts.  The first stage will accomplish Phase I of the two-phase selection procedu re and will consist of the issuance of a solicitation requesting interested Design/Build firms and/or teams to submit proposals of their qualifications, capabilities, experience, and related management/technical criteria.  Upon evaluation of all proposals,  the three (3) most highly qualified firms will be selected to enter into Phase II of the selection procedures.  Phase II will commence the second stage of the acquisition process consisting of a five-year term for the Government to issue selected Design/B uild solicitations to those three firms for competitive negotiations and award of Design/Build contracts.  As Design/Build projects are identified during the five-year term of the second stage, the three selected firms will receive a solicitation to submit  technical (design) and cost proposals for the design and construction of each project.  Upon the evaluation of the proposals and completion of competitive negotiation procedures for each project, Design/Build contracts will be awarded to the selected firm  for each particular project. This acquisition process will not provide any guaranteed value amount to any of the selected Design/Build firms, nor will the acquisition provide any guarantee of the award of a contract by the Government to any of the selected firms.  The acquisition proc ess will not specify a minimum nor maximum number of solicitations to be issued or contracts to be awarded during the term of the second stage, nor will the acquisition process specify a minimum or maximum contact value, cumulative or otherwise. Interest, comments, or questions should be directed to Randy Bratcher, Contract Specialist, telephone number 918-669-7459, or e-mail Randall.Bratcher@usace.army.mil   It is anticipated that the Phase I solicitation will be issued on or about 20 January 200 4.

<CONTACT>Renee Arcuri, Contracting Officer, Phone (315) 330-4777, Fax (315) 330-8094, Email Renee.Arcuri@rl.af.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to republish the original announcement, with administrative corrections and updates, pursuant to FAR 35.016(c).  The administrative corrections and updates are as follows:  (1) update the technical POC, (2) update the contracting POC in the body of the announcement, (3) delete the ombudsman program for the announcement (4) delete the requirement to send IFB a copy of the white paper cover letter and (5) extend the period for white paper acceptance to coincide with the length of the announcement.  This PRDA is open and effective until September 30, 2005. Technical POC: James Perretta, Laboratory Program Manager, 315-330-2016, (James.Perretta @rl.af.mil) and Renee Arcuri, Contracting Officer, 315-330-4777; (Renee.Arcuri@rl.af.mil). The AFRL Sensors Directorate at the Rome Research Site, as DARPA/ATO's technical and program execution agent, is soliciting white papers for innovative next generation spectrum assignment approaches to improve effective spectrum use for communications and sensors. This is a four-year open-ended Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) to solicit research and development white papers for the DARPA/AFRL Next Generation communications program. The desired overall result of the XG program is the transformation of spectrum assignment technology for DoD applications through dynamic spectral use. This effort covers a broad range of requirements in the area of next generation radio frequency spectrum use. Emphasis is placed on novel dynamic, autonomous spectrum assignment methodologies for communications and sensing, through integration and application of technology that can increase spectrum access through adaptive use of available spectrum. Concepts are sought in one of more of the following areas: a. Real-time sensing of spectrum usage; b. Real-time Characterization spectrum usage; c. Autonomously Reacting to and planning spectrum usage through selection of frequency, waveform, directionality, polarization, temporal characteristics and other novel usage approaches; d. Dynamically adapting to changes in spectrum usage. Although implementation is not required, communications techniques that are extensible to include Information Security (INFOSEC), Transmission Security (TRANSEC) and Communications Security (COMSEC) are desired. Awardees will prepare concepts and designs for demonstrations to address these requirements, and will perform analysis of the anticipated performance, including increases in spectrum access over existing technologies and practices. BACKGROUND. Currently, U.S. forces face unique spectrum access issues in each country in which they operate, due to competing civilian and government users of spectrum. These constraints must be reflected in all force planning, and may preclude the operation of critical systems. Coalition and Allied operations are even more complex to manage, and spectrum assignment issues may severely limit the U.S.'s ability to fully exploit its superiority and investment in information technology. We need a mechanism for rapid and efficient utilization of the shrinking military bandwidth in the dynamic environment of the 21st century and a viable solution to the commercial carriers' demands for additional spectrum. Assured communications (currently limited by spectrum availability) will be the difference between success and failure in the modern battlespace. The need for higher and more complex data services (a projected 250% increase in the next 10 years), coupled with the explosion of the commercial wireless market (request for additional 100 MHz of DoD assigned spectrum for 3rd Generation cellular), strain the current limits of military spectrum allocations both domestically and abroad. The military is transitioning to new warfighting systems (that require high degrees of situation awareness for survival) and new doctrine (that requires connectivity for coordination). It is estimated that temporal and spatial reuse of the spectrum by DoD emitters is much less than 1%. This low utilization is due to the inefficient use of the available bandwidth by legacy communications systems and allocation procedures. Additionally, the current and projected in-garrison problems are compounded by the inconsistencies of the international spectrum allocation environment when forces deploy. The advent of dynamic spectrum allocation will ameliorate the potential crisis for DoD spectrum availability for military and government systems. Dynamic spectrum allocation and control will require developments significantly beyond those taking place in the 3rd Generation cellular world, taking the U.S. beyond the 3rd Generation and into the next generation following it. It is the intent of AFRL and DARPA to fill this development need. The DARPA neXt Generation (XG) program goals are to develop both the enabling technologies and system concepts to provide dramatic improvements in assured military communications in support of a full range of worldwide deployments through the dynamic redistribution of allocated spectrum. DARPA's vision is to develop and demonstrate a range of innovative approaches to enabling technologies and system concepts to improve spectral utilization of military radio frequency emitters by a factor of 20. The XG program approach is to develop the theoretical underpinnings for dynamic control of the spectrum, the technologies and subsystems that enable reallocation of the spectrum, and the system appliqu? prototypes to demonstrate applicability to legacy and future DoD radio frequency emitters. The approach plans to investigate methods to leverage the technology base in microelectronics with new waveform and medium access and control (MAC) protocol technologies to construct an integrated system. The proposed program goals are to develop, integrate, and evaluate the technology to enable equipment to automatically select spectrum and operating modes to both minimize disruption of existing users, and to ensure operation of U.S. systems. The result of the XG program will be to develop and demonstrate an applique for legacy and future emitter systems for joint service utility. The program will develop both the enabling technologies and system concepts to provide assured military communications in support of worldwide, short notice deployments through the dynamic redistribution of allocated spectrum. This research will have significant impact on a wide variety of existing and future communications systems in the DoD and commercial environments. Specific areas of operational impact include: radars of all types, ground and air tactical communications, unmanned/robotic vehicle operations, data/video links and commercial mobile wireless operations. It is also expected to provide the common technical architecture that will meet the needs of both military and civilian future (beyond 3G) mobile communication and radar systems. This effort will require the involvement of a wide variety of government (joint and service laboratories) and commercial technology development centers and the support of the service operational communities and government spectrum agencies, Federal Communications Commission and the Office of Spectrum Analysis and Management (FCC & OSAM). These organizations have been briefed and support the effort. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit five (5) copies of a three (3) to ten (10) page white paper with a cover letter indicating whether the offeror is a large, small, woman-owned, small business, Historically Black College or University, or Minority Institution. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; Section C: Technical Summary. Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609. All white papers submitted in responses to this PRDA must be addressed to ATTN: James Perretta, Reference PRDA 02-01-IFKA, AFRL/SNRT, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY 13441-4514. Multiple white papers may be submitted in different areas of technology. White papers will be accepted until 30 Sep 2005. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this PRDA. Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this PRDA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a subsequent award. White papers submitted will be evaluated as they are received. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other white papers/proposals submitted under the announcement. It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY02 - 7 Dec 01; FY03 - 30Jun02; FY04 - 30Jun03; FY05 - 30 Jun04. White papers will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each Fiscal Year after the dates cited. Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria: a) The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, b) The innovativeness of the proposed approach and /or techniques, and c) The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees. Also, consideration of other factors, such as past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this PRDA will be used. No other evaluation criteria will be used in selecting proposals. The technical criteria will also be used to determine whether white papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this PRDA and of interest to the Government. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. Principal funding of this PRDA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in FY02. Individual awards will normally range from 6 months to 36 months in duration with dollar amounts normally ranging from $200,000 to $750,000 per year. Total funding for this PRDA is approximately $20M. Awards of efforts as a result of this PRDA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitation for proposal submissions. Responders are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number with their submission as well as a fax number, and an e-mail address. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting focal point, Renee Arcuri, for information if they contemplate responding.

<DESC>***AMENTMENT: TO REFLECT CHANGE OF CLOSING DATE, FROM 30 DEC 03 TO 20 JAN 04. The U.S Army Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center anticipate a requirement for the acquisition of manufacturing technologies that provide enhancements to rotor blade production.  The intended technologies could apply to current and future aviation systems, such as AH-64 Apache, RAH-66 Comanche, UH-60 Black Hawk and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). Enabling technologies are desired that explore advanced manufacturing methods and concepts in areas which include but are not limited to, rotor blade design and qualification, manufacturing, testing and support. Emphasis should be placed on two categories of ideas (1) Efforts that apply to existing rotor blades and (2) efforts that apply to new design rotor blades.  Each technology initiative should be supported by a schedule, cost estimate and projected return on investment (ROI).   Interested firms must respond in writing to the identified point of contact by 20 January 2004.  This synopsis is for planning purposes only and not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.

<DESC>5.	MARKET VALUE:			$61,251 - $79,629 per annum  (GS-13 equivalent) with 25% Post Differential  	
6.	PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:	Two years  
7.	PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:	USAID/CENTRAL ASIA, Tashkent, Uzbekistan 
8.	JOB DESCRIPTION:
A)  BACKGROUND
USAID/CAR Background:
Central Asia borders Russia, China, Iran and Afghanistan.  Due to its location amidst these neighbors and its substantial oil and gas reserves, Central Asia is a region of considerable geopolitical and strategic interest to the United States.   With a total population of 55 million and dozens of ethnic groups, the five new nations of the region are emerging from isolation and almost two centuries of Russian domination.  A recent civil war, threats of religious extremism, ethnic rivalries, authoritarian governments, and lack of viable institutions make Central Asia a particular challenge for USAID.  
USAID's Regional Mission for Central Asia (USAID/CAR) is responsible, in close consultation with the five U.S. Ambassadors in the region, for the design and management of USAID assistance programs in five republics.  The central office is located in Almaty, Kazakhstan with offices in Tashkent, Uzbekistan; Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; Osh, Kyrgyzstan; Ashgabat, Turkmenistan; and Dushanbe, Tajikistan.  USAID/CAR is one of the Agency's largest Missions responsible for approximately $90 million of assistance annually, with activities totaling $400 million in the areas of energy and environment, economics and finance, democracy and media, and health and humanitarian assistance.  It works in partnership with over 70 grantee and contractor teams.  USAID/CAR's assistance seeks to expand opportunities for participation, livelihood and quality of life for the citizens of the Central Asian Republics.  Staff frequently travels to each of the five countries to manage and monitor assistance.  
Conflict Mitigation Program Background Information:
A.	USAID/CAR’s conflict prevention and community action programs build social stability in key regions of Central Asia by improving living conditions and economic opportunities through community action and organization.  The programs includes cooperative agreements with: Mercy Corps International for cross-border activities in the Ferghana Valley; Mercy Corps International for activities in Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan; ACDI/VOCA for activities in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan; CHF for activities in southern Uzbekistan; Aga Khan Foundation for activities in Tajikistan; and UNDP for activities in Tajikistan.  Specific activities within these programs:
-	Rehabilitate and improve the social and public infrastructure of communities aimed at reducing conflict;
-	Provide loan and business development opportunities to micro and small enterprises; 
-	Facilitate dialogue in and among communities to address potential sources of conflict; and 
-	Build community organizational, self-governance, and advocacy capabilities
To ensure that USAID/CAR is meeting the needs of local communities, and to reinforce democratic processes, decisions regarding the selection of specific community development infrastructure projects such as schools, health clinics, domestic/potable community water delivery systems, and social service/community centers, involve the local community.  
Geographic Focus: The USAID/CAR Conflict Mitigation Program focuses on particular regions where the potential for conflict and extremism is greatest: the southern portions of Uzbekistan; the Ferghana Valley (Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan (including Batken)); southern Kazakhstan; non-Ferghana Valley regions of Tajikistan; and the Lebap region of Turkmenistan.
The Ferghana Valley is a key geographic focus of USAID/CAR’s program that has activities in all three countries comprising the Valley.  USAID/CAR works in the Ferghana Valley with local non-governmental organizations, the independent media and legal reform, substantial health care reform, support to small businesses including, micro-lending, capacity building for economic and business faculties, and significant investment in water and irrigation management.  In 2002, USAID/CAR expanded its Ferghana Valley activities to include a conflict mitigation program that spans all three countries, as well as other regions in Central Asia.
Types and Scope of Activities Envisioned:
The Conflict Mitigation Program is designed to focus on the following activities/areas:
	Community Mobilization: This activity utilizes a regional approach to reduce resource-based conflict through community mobilization and enhances cross-border and multi-ethnic linkages over a three-year period, by empowering cross-border and multi-ethnic communities to identify and address sources of conflict through constructive dialogue and action planning.   The community action programs will focus on enhancing community infrastructure, living conditions, and economic opportunities through improved community dialogue and collective action.
To ensure that USAID investments are sustainable and meet the needs of local communities we are assisting, all infrastructure repairs or new construction are selected through a participatory process involving citizens and local government/ leadership of the community.  Introduction of participatory, democratic practices through this project will also bolster USAID’s objectives in building a democratic culture in Central Asia.
	Infrastructure:  To the maximum extent possible, USAID is building linkages with other sectors in which USAID is working to ensure maximum synergies between reform processes and improved infrastructure.  These include health, water, and other activities that strengthen and improve communities.  A secondary factor is the breadth of the impact, targeting those activities that will touch as many lives in the community as possible.  A final consideration is sustainability.  While it should not be the driving factor for selection, we are targeting those types of infrastructure projects that are most likely to be sustainable in the long term.

<DESC>MANL Master Transformational Plan Sources Sought Synopsis


Hill Air Force Base is looking to develop a contract for the transformation of the existing maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities. This program will be to design, develop, construct, install, implement, and deliver a dramatically improved maintenance repair and overhaul process within exiting facilities. This program will transform the existing production environment from a process-oriented flow to a product oriented flow using the best cellular design methodology available. 

The program will institute lean cell technology and methodology within building 505, 507 and 510 at Hill Air Force Base Utah, which is responsible for the rebuilding and refurbishment of landing gear of C5, B1, KC 135, B52 C130, F16, F15, F4, T38, A10 landing gear, as well as future work loads to be defined. 

The objective of the program will be to improve the maintenance, repair and overhaul processes and facilitate change through transformational activities that increase product through put, reduce production cost, reduce inventory, and provide a process infrastructure for future work load within the current facility. This transformation will need to be accomplished while maintaining current production quotas as scheduled to meet AFMC requirements. During the design and implementation of this effort, the Air Force and the contractor will serve as a fully integrated team involved in all aspects of this effort. While the contractor will serve as the prime contractor in this effort, the OO-ALC transformational team will serve as the overarching decision making body.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) intends to obtain industry inputs to assist the DoD in formulating open standards for packet based communications over transponded satellites utilizing the Internet Protocol (IP) and in defining requirements for possible future procurements. 

The IP satellite modem standards will define the air interface, baseband interface, modem control and management, and modem capabilities and performance requirements. The packet satellite modem standards are anticipated to document capabilities to provide multiple access communications supporting IP network services over transponded satellites.  These IP networks are proposed for use on DSCS, Gapfiller, and commercial satellites for strategic and tactical communications.

Information requested from industry includes but is not limited to: 1) waveforms utilized for IP satellite communications.  This should specifically address the modulation, coding, TDMA structure and all capabilities associated with transport of IP packets over the RF link;  2) the approach for providing SCPC point-to-point, hub-spoke and full mesh sub-network topologies; 3) the incorporation of multiple waveforms in a system of systems architecture, to possibly include MF-TDMA DAMA, broadcast hub/spoke with return channel signaling (e.g., DVB-S/, DVB-RCS), MIL-STD 188-165A compliant FDMA, etc.; 4) discuss the implications of Software Communications Architecture (SCA) compliance as it pertains to any of the other information provided for this RFI; 5) an approach for providing QoS/CoS and for addressing performance characteristics such as delay, jitter, MLPP, and other; 6) recommendations for standardization process maximizing industry capabilities and participation; 7) address recommended capabilities (advantages/disadvantages) for network services capabilities/functions such as address resolution, routing and switching to be included in the packet IP satellite modem; the 8) provide details of modem control and network management functionality required for operation of the packet satellite modem (include in this real time functionality as well as overall system management functionality); 9) describe any unique capabilities that may be required for DoD applications, especially as it relates to tactical terminals and  requirements such as Communications-on-the-Move, Communications-on-the-Pause, and shipboard applications (i.e. antenna handover and Doppler); 10) provide details on user interfaces that can be readily supported and any unique requirements that will require modifications to the existing capability; 11)  discuss technologies utilized in the implementation of IP over satellites; 12) IPv6 implementation;  and 13) cost estimates.

Responses shall be submitted in written form to: DISA/GO5, Mr. Alexander Bartko at bartkoa@ncr.disa.mil and PM DCATS, Mr. Bob Yee at Robert.Yee@us.army.mil.  Proprietary information shall be clearly identified.  Requests for clarification on this RFI shall be addressed to the POCs above.  Please indicate your willingness to support an open forum based on the results of this RFI, in support of the continuing development of the open standard. Respondents should anticipate requests for further information based on the input they provide.

This request is a request for information not a RFP and does not commit the Government to pay for preparation costs nor does it commit the Government to the release of a future RFP.

<DESC>United States Postal Service (USPS) is seeking information from potential sources to provide a flexible retail Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) product (i.e., application, utility, API, library, etc.) to support strategic initiatives of the USPS. 
  
The USPS currently has Point Of Service (POS) ONE systems and Integrated Retail Terminals (IRTs) deployed nationwide.  There are currently multiple vendors that provide the technology, hardware, software and support for POS ONE and IRT programs.  Additionally there are some smaller post office sites  that are currently using manual systems. 

The users of the system will include retail associates servicing the customers, managers, supervisors, postmasters, stock custodians, and vending personnel.

Postal facilities may consist of concrete flooring, dusty air, space constraints, and inconsistent technology architectures.  Physical facility layouts, sizes, and dimensions vary drastically.  

USPS objective is to implement a robust, flexible and fully integrated Point Of Service solution that will meet dynamic USPS business goals and objectives. The solution must utilize state of the art technologies that are “user centric” with an emphasis on “Quick Service”. 

The system administration module/interface must have extensive configuration capability and flexibility to incorporate a dynamic set of USPS business rules. The system should be data-driven, hardware independent, and must be cost effective to maintain and manage, in order to lower the Total Cost of Ownership for the USPS.

The ultimate goal of the USPS is to “Enhance The Overall Customer Experience” and achieve corporate “Revenue Goals”

USPS strategy is to deploy the new software to small offices that are currently working manually and to replace software for POS ONE and IRTs with a single nation-wide COTS solution.

Suppliers interested in this requirement may submit an email titled "Next Generation RFI" to jewell.r.powell@usps.gov.  A copy of the RFI will be forwarded.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential sources to privatize the natural gas distribution system and wastewater collection system at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois. The following information is only an estimate of the size, scope, and general description of the natural gas and sanitary wastewater utility systems at Scott AFB and is subject to change. Scott AFB is an active military installation located near Belleville, Illinois, approximately 25 miles east of St. Louis, Missouri. The base is located on 3,230 acres of Air Force owned land. It has over 2000 facilities including military family housing units. Natural Gas System: Scott AFB plans to privatize natural gas lines in one area of the base; Scott Lake Housing area (TLF’s), which has twelve regulators. There is approximately 4000 ft. of polypropylene gas line in this area. The recently constructed Patriots Landing housing area has natural gas lines but they have not been turned over to the base yet. These gas lines may be available for privatization when they become government property. Wastewater System: The wastewater treatment system includes a collection system and a treatment plant. The collection system consists of approximately 25 miles of pipe ranging from 4“to 21” in diameter. The pipe is primarily vitrified clay and concrete, although PVC, cast iron and ductile iron pipe are also used. The wastewater treatment plant, originally constructed in the 1940’s, has received several modifications and currently treats 2 million gallons per day with an expansion capacity to 3 million gallons per day. The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right of Way as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  At this time, no solicitation exists: therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION. Vendors having the skills and capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirement are invited to provide information to contribute to this market survey/sources sought including, commercial market information and company information via e-mail or facsimile (703-767-2387) to Mily Le, no later than March 31, 2004.

<CONTACT>Capt Jacob Campbell, Contract Manager, Phone (310) 363-2033, Fax null, Email jacob.campbell@losangeles.af.mil -  Lt Casey Wood, Project Officer, Phone (310) 363-5427, Fax null, Email casey.wood@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC>The US Air Force intends to purchase up to approximately 44,000 AN/PRQ-7 radio sets for Full Rate Production (FRP) for the Combat Survivor Evader Locator System (CSEL) Interested parties are invited to submit a statement of technical capabilities which includes the following information: 1) Company name, mailing address, points of contact and telephone numbers, 2) Business size classification, Large, Small, or Other, 3) Experience in small/survival radios or similar technologies, and 4) The facilities to work at the appropriate security level. Interested offerors must submit Statements of Capabilities (SOC), which clearly show that they are qualified to perform this effort. Send your capability statements to SMC/GPK (ATTN: Capt. Jake Campbell), 2435 Vela Way, Suite 1866, El Segundo, CA 90245-4659. Oral communications are not acceptable. This acquisition is intended to fulfill urgent operational requirements. This notice is strictly sources sought synopsis and shall not be considered a request for offers. Prospective contractors should submit information in writing no later than the deadline date stated above with well-documented evidence of their capability to meet all technical contractual requirements. All production radios must meet the form, fit, function and NSA security design features of the existing CSEL AN/PRQ-7 Radio Set and the CSEL system architecture as described below. SYSTEM OVERVIEW: The CSEL system provides isolated personnel (IP) in need of rescue with: DoD GPS policy compliant precision Global Positioning System (GPS) based geoposition and navigation data in a navigation warfare (SAASM-based with direct Y capability) environment, two-way over-the-horizon (OTH), NSA approved secure data communications to Joint Search and Rescue Centers (JSRCs)/Rescue Coordination Centers(RCC), OTH beacon operation, Line-of-Sight (LOS) voice communication, sweep tone and swept tone beacon capabilities. The CSEL system architecture is composed of three segments: Over-the-Horizon (OTH), Ground, and User. The OTH segment operates in three modes each using one of three Communication systems: UHF Satellite Communications (UHFSATCOM), other assets, and COSPAS (Space System for Search of Vessels in Distress [Russian translation])/Search and Rescue Satellite Assisted Tracking (SARSAT). The UHFSATCOM mode supports two-way world-wide secure data messaging for 197 users every half hour between the AN/PRQ-7 radio and the AN/GRC-242 UHF SATCOM Base Station (UBS) over a dedicated 5Khz channel.  IP or JSRC/RCC operator messages are then routed to the appropriate UBS and JSRC/RCC CSEL workstation JSRC/RCC command, control, and communications application (C3).  AN/PRQ-7 transmissions are automatically acknowledged upon receipt at the UBS prior to routing to the JSRC/RCC workstation C3 application.  A third OTH mode supports one-way secure messaging/geoposition from the AN/PRQ-7 using the Low Probability of Exploitation (LPE) capability to the JSRC/RCC workstation C3 application with return messaging capability available through UHF SATCOM.  In addition the AN/PRQ-7 is capable of dual LPE/UHF transmissions with return messaging over UHF SATCOM.  COSPAS-SARSAT provides non-secure, one-way data & beacon transmission and is intended for emergency use above or below 70 degrees latitude where UHFSATCOM coverage is lacking. The Ground segment is composed of Defense Information Infrastructure Common Operating Environment (DII COE) compliant CSEL JSRC/RCC C3 application segment software. This software must be installed on a DII COE compliant workstation connected to the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET), which links the JSRC/RCC workstation to the UBS.  The User segment consists of the AN/PRQ-7 radio, J-6431/PRQ-7 Radio Set Adapter (RSA), Radio Set Mission Loading Application Software and a service-provided IBM compatible computer using the Windows 2000 operating system.  These elements of equipment are collectively known as CSEL Planning Equipment (CPE).  The Mission Loading Application software installed in the IBM compatible computer is required to load communications frequencies, waypoints, callsigns, routing information, and optional user password into the AN/PRQ-7.  The RSA provides the physical and electrical interface between the IBM compatible computer and an AN/PRQ-7 and also between key fill devices and the AN/PRQ-7 for loading of GPS keys. A second AN/PRQ-7 serves as the reference radios and is used to transfer GPS position, almanac, ephemeris, and time to the target radio.  Potential offerors must demonstrate the capability to produce an AN/PRQ-7 Radio Set and associated CPE that has completed a Multi-Service Operational Test and Evaluation under the oversight of DOT&E and be capable of receiving an AFOTEC finding that the system is effective and suitable and has received a positive DOT&E Beyond LRIP Report to Congress prior to contract award.  Contractor will be required to produce first delivery operational radios no later than one year after contract award to meet urgent operational requirements.

<DESC>This is a Market Research, Sources Sought synopsis seeking potential 8(a) small business concerns capable of providing an evaluation of natural language processing techniques for the intelligence community.  The natural language processing techniques revolve around the evaluation of search systems and summarization systems. Search systems are systems such as Google that take a short statement in English of what is wanted and return pointers to documents that most likely contain that information. Summarization systems produce short synopses of a set of related documents. The evaluation of search systems is performed within a series of workshops known as TREC (Text REtrieval Conference); summarization is evaluated in DUC (Document Understanding Conference).  Both conferences are held after the conclusion of the Contractor’s research. More details about TREC and DUC are given on the NIST web site at http://trec.nist.gov and http://duc.nist.gov.  Since the intelligence community (the Department of Defense, National Security Administration, Central Intelligence Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency and others) is the target user for the systems ONLY potential 8(a) offerors with experience in intelligence analysis (i.e. people who have worked for these agencies gathering intelligence by examining large amounts of data from various sources) shall provide a response. This experience must be clearly shown and supported in the capability statement.  The government estimates that the total number of man hours to complete this requirement for the Base Year will be approximately 7,300 hours performed on a sporadic basis between March 2004 and October 2004.  The man hours are expected to be the same for each option year, and will also be performed on a sporadic basis. Because humans react to the data and task differently, it is critical to the integrity of the evaluation process that the test materials be created by a wide sample of potential users of the technology.  Therefore, the Government requires a minimum of 30 different test samples (i.e. from 30 different people).  The following is only an overview of the tasks required to complete the Government’s requirement for TREC research: develop 10-20 test questions (called topics) for the TREC testing cycle, read a pooled list of about 2,000 documents determining relevancy to the topic, search the TREC collections for answers to a set of questions, determine if answers to questions are appropriate.  The following is only an overview of the tasks required to complete the Government's requirement for DUC research:  from twenty-five clusters of documents (each cluster will contain on average 10 documents ranging in size from 10 sentences to 10 pages of singled-spaced text), create a very short summary (<= 75 bytes) of each document and from each cluster a short summary (<= 665 bytes).  Additionally, select document clusters based on a question, each cluster shall contain on average 10 documents. From each of these ten documents, create a very short summary (<= 75 bytes) of each document and from each cluster a short summary (<= 665 bytes).  Examine the output returned from the participating research groups systems and compare them to the contractor created summaries (very short and short summaries).  Interested 8(a) firms shall provide the Government with (1) Name of Company-include a contact person's name, telephone number, and email address; (2) Company Address; (3) Company Size which shall be 8(a); (4) Identify whether the services identified above are of a type offered and sold competitively in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace based on established catalog or market prices and whether these services are exclusively provided to the Government; (5) Identify standard commercial terms and conditions typically associated with these services; (6) Describe experience and past performance with similar types of requirements of similar scope and magnitude and whether they were performance-based - include the contract number; Government agency name and address; contract funded amount; (7) Identify existing or potential pricing structure in support of this type of work; and (8) Identify qualifications of technical and management personnel. ***** THIS SYNOPSIS IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND A CONTRACT WILL NOT BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS. ***** 8(a) firms interested in performing this requirement may reply to this RFI by January 7, 2004 addressing the elements above and any processes that would be used. Replies shall be provided in duplicate hard copy ONLY (one original and one copy).  NO ELECTRONIC OF FAXED RESPONSES WILL BE ACCEPTED. There is a page limit of 50 for the capability statement.  Proprietary processes or data must be clearly marked and documented as such.  Respondents should include your firms Dun and Bradstreet Number (DUNS), Tax Identification Number (TIN) and Central Contractor Register Number (CCR).

<DESC>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), in conjunction with Section 3008 of the Food Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (Farm Bill) "Assistance for stockpiling and rapid transportation, delivery and distribution of shelf-stable prepackaged foods", is looking for expressions of interest from U.S. non-profit organizations (see section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) for the preparation of shelf-stable prepackaged foods requested by eligible organizations and the establishment and maintenance of stockpiles food in the U.S.  USAID will make grants available to non-profit organizations to carry out the above activities.  Preference will be given to non-profit organizations that provide one of the following: a.) Non-Federal funds in an amount equal to 50 percent of the amount of funds received under the grant; b.) An in-kind contribution in an amount equal to that percentage; or c.) A combination of such funds and an in-kind contribution for the preparation of shelf-stable prepackaged foods and the establishment and maintenance of stockpiles of the foods in the U.S.

The intent of this program is to facilitate the use of donated food in international feeding so that food donated can be processed, packaged, stored and transported overseas in time of need.  To minimize the risks of spoilage and to facilitate transport, products should be shelf-stable and prepackaged rather than raw.  Commodity packaging should be compatible with container shipment.  While any shelf-stable prepackaged product is of interest, experience suggests that the majority of product uses will be in institutions such as medical facilities, schools or charitable shelters for children, HIV/AIDS victims or the elderly.  

In addition to those nonprofit organizations solicited above, Private Voluntary Organizations (PVO) and International Organizations (IO) who can provide for the rapid transportation, delivery, and distribution of shelf-stable prepackaged foods to needy individuals in foreign countries are encouraged to notify USAID of their interest in participation in this program.  USAID, subject to availability of funds, the food made available from the nonprofit suppliers, the appropriateness of the available food for each program and the steps demonstrated by the PVO or IO to manage the food provided, will enter into separate grants with those organizations.  It should be noted that these grants will be small but will provide for ocean and inland freight costs as well as a reasonable amount of handling.  

Again, please note that while preference is given to those non-profit organizations that physically process raw commodity into shelf-stable and prepackaged food, those non-profit organizations receiving donated shelf-stable and prepackaged food from other organizations and who prepare and consolidate these donations in order to make them available to overseas PVO or IO programs through their receipt, stockpiling and storing these foods are also encouraged to respond to this notice.

<DESC>USACECOM anticipates soliciting a sole-source contract to DRS (formerly Sierra Research) in 2QFY04 for a seven year, requirements type contract with firm fixed price, time and material, and cost plus fixed fee contract line items to conduct Technical  Engineering Service activities for the AN/TPQ-45, Aircraft Survivability Equipment Trainer (ASET)IV, NSN 6920-01-347-1083.  The ASET IV  system consists of a suite of six High Mobility Multi Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs) which have been modified to simulate a  composite air defense battery consisting of Radio Frequency (RF)Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAM), Infra Red (IR) SAMs and Anti Aircraft Artillery (AAA). Each suite consists of one Command and Control Communications (CCC)Vehicle, one RFSAM simulator vehicle, two IRSAM simulator vehicles and two AAA simulator vehicles.  The AAA vehicle which was originally fielded has been modified into a dual-mode vehicle and has been renamed the AAA(2) simulator vehicle.  A total of eight ASET IV systems are currently in the Army inventory.  There are systems at:  National Training Center, Fort Irwin, CA (3), Joint Readiness Training Center, Fort Polk, LA (1), Combat Maneuver Training Center, Hohenfels, Germany(1), Fort Hood, TX (1), and Fort Campbell, KY (1).  The eighth syst em will be fielded to Fort Bragg, NC (1) in 2004.  The ASET IV is used to create a high-fidelity electronic warfare training environment in which helicopter aircrews can train in the tactics, techniques and procedures of their Aircraft Survivability Equipm ent (ASE).  These engineering efforts are a continuation of on-going efforts which may include but are not limited to:  a.  Complete fielding (to include training of operators and maintenance personnel)of a suite of ASET IV vehicles to Fort Bragg, NC.  b. Design and complete corrective actions required to permit fielding of previously built RFSAM(2)modification kits.  c.

17.The NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division plans to  
negotiate with Lockheed Martin Information Systems, Orlando,
FL  32825 on a sole source basis under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, “Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements”.  Award will be made via a modification to an existing delivery order.  The KC-130 aircrafts are currently being upgraded to incorporate the Airborne Survivability Equipment (ASE) to ensure fleet survivability during the war effort in Iraq.  However, Device 2F107, which is used to train the KC-130 squadrons that will be deployed to Iraq in 2004, does not have this ASE installed or integrated.  The USMC has made it a priority to provide ASE training to it’s fleet.  Accordingly, under engineering change proposal (ECP) procedures, LMIS is being tasked with delivery of ASE upgrade with the Device 2F107 visual upgrade.  The ASE is dependant upon the successful installation and integration of the TEN, as well as host and instructor station modifications, to function as it does in the KC-130 aircraft.  

LMIS is currently contracted to incorporate the visual upgrade into Device 2F107.  All Device 2F107 engineering drawings and documents being developed by LMIS will include the visual upgrade related data.  An approvable technical data package is anticipated 90 days after RFT.  It is only after all Government comments are incorporated into the final deliverables that the Government would be able to provide a verified and accepted technical data package to permit a competitive acquisition strategy for the ASE upgrade.   Additionally, Device 2F107 is being bailed to LMIS from February 2004 to RFT, thus eliminating access to the trainer by any other contractor to install the ASE upgrade until after the visual upgrade RFT and after the technical data package is approved.

Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  In doing so, interested sources must submit detailed technical capabilities, pricing, and any other information which demonstrates their ability to meet the needs of the Government.  Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the above contact address (ATTN:  Romy Roman-Conway) by 08 January 2004. All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.  Responses shall be limited to no more than FIVE pages.  This synopsis is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals.  No solicitation document is available.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the Government.  If no affirmative written response is received, the contract will be awarded without further notice.*****

<SUBJECT>75 -- REQUEST FOR IMPACT INFORMATION ON SALES OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS POTENTIALLLY AFFECTED BY A PROPOSED ADDITION TO THE COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE PROCUREMENT LIST
<DESC>This notice does not constitute a request for information, quote or proposal for procurement of products or services.  The Committee for Purchase has been asked to consider adding the below listed product(s) to its Procurement List (PL).  This action would be taken under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, whose purposes include providing employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Product(s) added to the PL must subsequently be purchased from a nonprofit agency(ies) designated by the Committee.  An addition to the PL could have severe adverse impact on a company’s overall financial status.  

Surge Protectors (6105-00-NIB-0002; 6105-00-NIB-0003; 6105-00-NIB-0004; and 6105-00-NIB-0005 – Models include a metal surge protector with fax and phone, 1110 Joule rating & AC adaptor spacing with a 6 foot power cord, that provides electrical and phone/fax line protection.  Metal 2 in 1 surge protectors with fax/phone including “Slit” feature with 5 outlet protectors permanently connected with a 4 foot cord between the units/10 total outlets.  8 outlet surge protector with a compact design that provides electrical and phone/fax line maximum surge protection in a small compact design.  7 outlet surge protector with 3 line protection with 6 foot cord and 840 Joule rating.) 

 In determining whether a product is suitable for addition to the PL, the Committee considers the impact on commercial firms who are providing the product(s) to the Government as MAS/BPA vendors.  Specifically, the Committee considers the potential impact on the firm's sales, and the extent to which the firm is dependent on the income from such sales to the Federal Government.  It is then the Committee’s responsibility to determine whether the benefits of adding a product, or a portion thereof, to the PL offset any potential adverse impact on commercial firms. 
To determine whether the addition of the product(s) listed in this notice would have a severe adverse impact on a firm, the Committee will consider its total annual sales from all sources for the most recent 12-month period for which data is available.  It also needs to receive information on the total revenue derived by a company in the same 12-month period from the sale of the products being considered for addition to the PL.  Documents substantiating the total revenue sales figures must also be provided.  If audited data is available, it should be provided.  You may also wish to notify your employees or their representatives about this possible addition to the Procurement List. 
When the Committee assesses impact on a contractor, it takes into account the sales of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well.  If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, the Committee requests the other corporations to which the company is related and the nature of the relationship be identified, and that total sales information data is provided for the other corporations.  

If the information provided the Committee is considered confidential, please advise and it will be safeguarded.  Because of the tight time constraints associated with adding products to the PL, it is essential that the Committee receive the information by the response date indicated on this notice.  If no information is received by that date, the Committee will consider that there will be no severe adverse impact on any commercial firm should the listed product(s) be added to the PL. 
For more information concerning the Committee and its authority, refer to Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  You may also telephone Mr. Barry S. Lineback, Operations Analyst on the Committee staff, at (703) 603-0035 for further information.

<DESC>PUBLIC PRIVATE ALLIANCES IN USAID EDUCATION STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE:  INCREASED ACCESS TO QUALITY EDUCATION AND LIVELIHOOD SKILLS IN SELECTED AREAS

Ladies/Gentlemen:

USAID/Philippines invites interest from prospective partner organizations to form public-private alliances to carry out activities in support of USAID/Philippines’ Education Strategic Objective: Increased Access to Quality Education and Livelihood Skills in Selected Areas.   In October 2003, the U.S. Government (USG) launched a new education program in the Philippines, to be implemented principally through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), to foster “Increased Access to Quality Education and Livelihood Skills in Selected Areas.”  The USG has committed to make available up to $33 million over six years (FY 2004 – FY 2009), subject to the availability of funds, to improve the quality of education on the conflict-affected southern island of Mindanao, focused particularly on the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM).  USAID plans a comprehensive but targeted program, with a specific focus on the ARMM but also with selected policy reform components at national and regional levels.  

Alliance partners are expected to bring significant new resources, ideas, technologies, and/or partners to address Education problems in the Philippines. Partners may include a wide range of organizations such as: foundations, U.S. and non-U.S. non-governmental organizations (NGOs), U.S. and non-U.S. private businesses, business and trade associations, international organizations, U.S. and non-U.S. colleges and universities, U.S. cities and states, other U.S. Government agencies, civic groups, other donor governments, host country governments, regional organizations, host country parastatals, philanthropic leaders including venture capitalists, public figures, advocacy groups, pension funds and employee-welfare plans, etc. Successful proposals bringing  at least a 1:1 resource matching to focus on Education will be considered but a 3:1 resource matching is highly desirable.

The full APS is posted at http://www.usaid-ph.gov/.

All concept papers must be in English and submitted directly to William E. Reynolds, USAID/Philippines, 8/F PNB Financial Center, Roxas Blvd., Pasay City 1308.  An original and one copy are required.  Issuance of this APS does not constitute an award or commitment on the part of the U.S. Government, nor does it commit the U.S. Government to pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of a concept paper.

Please submit all questions concerning this request via e-mail to William E. Reynolds (wireynolds@usaid.gov) or by facsimile at (632) 552-9899 ext 5404.  

Sincerely,
William E. Reynolds

EDUCATION STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE:  INCREASED ACCESS TO QUALITY EDUCATION AND LIVELIHOOD SKILLS IN SELECTED AREAS


I. 	Background

USAID is committed to improving the way we implement our foreign assistance mandate through broader collaboration with others. No longer are governments, international organizations, and multilateral development banks the only assistance donors. Rather, over the past 30 years, non-governmental organizations (NGOs)/private voluntary organizations (PVOs), cooperatives, foundations, corporations, the higher education community, and even individuals (including remittances from immigrants), now provide resources that contribute to development. As a result, the U.S. Government sees an exciting opportunity to enhance the impact of development assistance by improving and extending its collaboration with other partners.

USAID has successfully developed strategic alliances in the past in its extensive range of partnerships with, notably, PVOs, NGOs, US universities and colleges, and bilateral and multilateral donor agencies. In 2001, USAID launched the Global Development Alliance (GDA) which extends this concept further by, first, increasing the number of prospective partners to include private business, foundations, and other private-sector organizations, and, second, seeking alliances with partners that leverage significant resources and technologies, to address international development issues. 

USAID is reorienting how it sees itself in the context of international development assistance, how it relates to traditional partners, and how it seeks out alliances with new partners. USAID uses its resources and expertise to assist strategic partners in their investment decisions, and stimulates new investments by bringing new actors and ideas to the overseas development arena. While the Agency will continue to deploy resources where private funding is not available and where the governmental role is clear and pre-eminent (as in promoting institutional and policy change), it hopes, through the use of public-private alliances where appropriate, to stimulate new investment and new practices by bringing new actors and new ideas into the international development arena. 

USAID has much to offer the international community with its unique mandate within the U.S. Government and long-term experience with, and access to, host-country governments. The Agency is able to capitalize on its extensive field presence, network of local development partners and technical expertise to catalyze, integrates, coordinate, and facilitate public-private alliances among development assistance actors. USAID recognizes that effective alliances will marry common interests and will require time and careful planning. However, such alliances have the potential for not only mobilizing additional resources for development assistance programs worldwide, but also promoting greater effectiveness of those programs, and hence greater impact on the problems of poverty, disease, inadequate education, depletion of natural resources, and limited economic opportunity throughout the developing world.

Leadership within USAID in promoting alliance building under the GDA business model rests with the Global Development Alliance (GDA) Secretariat. In developing these alliances, USAID is using the following precepts:

•&#61472;	Alliances are expected to bring significant new resources, new ideas, new technologies and/or new partners to work with existing partners in new ways, to address development problems in countries where USAID works. 

•&#61472;	It is very important to exercise due diligence before entering into alliance arrangements. To ensure that the interests of all alliance partners are protected, the track record, the objectives, and reputations of all alliance partners need to be examined.

•&#61472;	There is no pre-defined minimum or maximum number of partners; each alliance will be different. There are many categories of potential alliance partners.

•&#61472;	Fairness and transparency are overarching principles in forming alliances.
Exploration of possible alliances should take place in a transparent manner and should involve wide consultation with possible partners.

•&#61472;	Alliances must clearly establish up front how the interests and objectives of each party converge. This expression of interests and objectives should then lead to an operational plan that, if successfully implemented, will produce clearly defined development results.

•&#61472;	Alliances should not simply be grants to organizations that have expressed an intention to seek third party partnerships that are not yet formed.

•&#61472;	Like all investments in development, alliance activities at the country level that actively involve local leadership and local beneficiaries in design and implementation are the ones most likely to be successful and sustainable. Local ownership, leadership and beneficiary participation are still keys to success.

•&#61472;	Alliances seek a minimum of a one-to-one leverage ratio of resources with three-to-one highly desirable. Leveraged resources will not always be money; different partners can contribute different assets. In addition to monetary contributions, in-kind resources, intellectual property, implementation know-how, and technical assistance are also valuable contributions. Alliance proposals must clearly specify what each party is contributing and indicate cash value of in-kind support.

•&#61472;	While alliance proposals must specify what each party is contributing at the outset, it is also recognized that lasting alliances are living, changing entities.
Some alliances will start small and expand over time as the alliance matures and succeeds, trust is built, and the benefits to the partners and beneficiaries become clearer.

Please refer to the GDA website at www.usaid.gov/gda for more information about the history and objectives of this important initiative. In addition, the website has “Tools for Alliance Builders” (http://www.usaid.gov/gda/tab.html) which contains in-depth information to assist in the due diligence process, as well as mechanisms and approaches to alliance formation.

Sector and Program Objectives

This Annual Program Statement (APS) seeks to support activities that will be quick to start and responsive to the Education Strategic Objective. 

Please see Annex A for a full discussion of the programmatic activities where USAID/Philippines seeks to develop public-private alliances in education.

II. 	Purpose of APS and Qualifying Criteria for Prospective Alliances

This APS seeks public-private alliance proposals only for funding in Fiscal Year (FY) 2004, although proposals should contemplate an alliance that continues beyond FY 2004. Under this APS, USAID/Philippines solicits proposals from organizations that are interested in entering into public-private alliances with others, including USAID, to carry out activities that will be responsive to the Education Strategic Objective.  USAID will review alliance proposals using a two-stage process more fully described in Sections III and IV.

The minimum grant threshold will be $25,000.00.  Consideration of Grants above that amount will be subject to availability of funds and program requirements. The actual number of awards under this APS is subject to the availability of funds and viability of proposals received. USAID reserves the right to make multiple grants or no awards at all through this APS. To be considered for an award under this APS, each applicant must meet the following qualifying criteria:

Partner Eligibility Criteria

This Annual Program Statement focuses on establishing public-private alliances to define a need and its solution, and to combine resources to achieve far-reaching, mutually upon results.. It is important to note that NGOs do not need to be registered Private Voluntary Organizations to participate. Potential for-profit applicants should note that USAID policy prohibits the payment of fee/profit to the prime recipient under grants and cooperative agreements. Forgone profit does not qualify as cost-sharing or leveraging.

In addition, all prospective partners must be organizations with a reputation for integrity and the highest standard of conduct, and a proven track record in their particular areas of expertise. They should be able to demonstrate a respect for human rights, decent work conditions, environmental protection, and community involvement in their operational practices. They should also be able to provide evidence of a strong commitment to the proposed alliance and, ideally, experience in working in partnership with others.

Program Eligibility Criteria

To be considered for funding under this APS, proposed programs must meet the following requirements:

1. 	Alliance proposals must have clearly-defined objectives that have been agreed to by the partners.

2. 	Alliance proposals are expected to demonstrate significant new, non-federal resources – whether money, ideas, technologies, experience and expertise – to address education development problems (see Leverage criteria).

3.	Alliance proposals must address the development needs of the Philippines 

4. 	Alliance proposals must contribute to the USAID/Philippines Education Strategic Objective (see Annex A).

5. 	Alliance proposals must offer promise of significant development impact, as measured, for example, by the number of direct and indirect beneficiaries of the program, and/or by the potential for replication or scaling-up over time.

6.	Alliance proposals must appear feasible from a technical, economic, financial, and social perspective.

7. 	It is expected that programs may last from 12 to 36 months. Priority will be given to proposals that can be launched rapidly.

Leverage

GDA alliances are expected to bring significant new, non-federal resources – whether money, ideas, technologies, experience and expertise – to address education development problems in the Philippines. To qualify for USAID funding under this APS, an alliance must demonstrate that partners are able and willing to collectively contribute significant resources to the proposed program that are preferably more than but at least equal to the level of resources sought from USAID. Further, it must be shown that these resources, in combination with the support sought from USAID, will provide the alliance with a comparative advantage in meeting the goals and objectives of the proposed program. It is this expectation of significant leverage of non-federal resources in combination with joint planning and sharing risks and benefits, that defines the public-private alliances under the GDA as distinct and different from those activities USAID has previously supported. This APS is not intended to yield additional traditional grant relationships


III. Proposal Instructions, Review Process, and Evaluation Criteria

A two-tiered proposal process will be utilized. Tier one consists of the submission and review of concept papers. Tier two consists of the submission and evaluation of full proposals.

Tier one consists of USAID review of concept papers to determine: 1) whether the proposed alliance meets the intent of the GDA business model and is eligible for further consideration and 2) the degree of interest in the proposed alliance by the USAID/Philippines Mission. At the conclusion of this stage, applicants with promising proposals will be invited to develop a full proposal for USAID funding, requiring detailed planning with alliance partners on program implementation and resource commitments. An invitation to develop a proposal does not automatically imply USAID funding. 

Tier two will consist of the evaluation of full proposals submitted at the invitation of USAID. At the conclusion of the tier two reviews, USAID will select alliance proposals that it intends to fund and will proceed to negotiate an award with each successful applicant subject to availability of funding.

Tier One: Concept papers must be strictly limited to no more than five pages in length and should address the following:

•&#61472;&#61472;	&#61515;ey&#61472;objectives of the alliance;

•&#61472;	Leveraging, such that the value of non-federal resources provided by alliance partners is equal to or exceeds levels of resources sought from USAID; description of resources to be provided by partners and approximate value;

•&#61472;	The number and types of beneficiaries that will benefit from the alliance activity;

•&#61472;	Program strategy to achieve those results;

•&#61472;	The role of all alliance partners, and demonstration of commitment or interest by prospective alliance partners; and

•	&#61472;Budget that identifies the total estimated cost of the program with a breakout of major expense categories (up to half a page; no proprietary cost information such as indirect cost rates should be submitted at this stage).

Concept papers in response to this APS will be due no later than March 15, 2004.  The concept paper review process is anticipated to take two months.  At the end of this two month review, prospective alliances with an eligible concept paper and a potential
USAID partner will be asked to submit a full proposal for the second-tier review.

Concept papers will be evaluated using the following criteria:

1.   Leverage

2.   Proposed Education Strategic Objective Alliance Program

3.   Prospective Alliance Partners

All concept papers that qualify for GDA funding according to these threshold criteria will be reviewed by USAID/Philippines. Those proposals 1) that offer the greatest promise of contributing to the goals and objectives of the Mission and 2) to which USAID may be willing to contribute its own managerial and financial resources will be accepted for further consideration. Those proposed alliances will be invited to further develop the program plan and to submit a full proposal as a basis for a potential USAID award.  

Tier Two: If the applicant receives a favorable evaluation of the concept paper in the tier one, the applicant will be asked to then submit a more detailed submission or a full proposal limited to 25 pages.  Full proposals will undergo a comprehensive evaluation using the factors described in Section IV below, including the submission of the following information, as well as any additional requirements specifically requested by the USAID/Philippines. The alliance will be notified of specific requirements, in addition to those listed below in the invitation to submit a full application. Invitations for full proposals will be sent approximately 60 days after the deadline for receiving concept papers.

IV. 	Awarding Alliances

Due Diligence Concerns

Due diligence requires that the U.S. Government enter into alliance with organizations and individuals who exhibit fiscal responsibility, character, and integrity. Annex C sets forth a number of questions, which, if applicable to the organization and program, will be factored into the evaluation and selection process governing an award. Not all the questions are appropriate for all situations. For example, a prospective alliance with a locally-owned private company in a developing country is likely to be quite different from a headquarters-based alliance with major multinational corporations, and a number of these questions would likely not apply. USAID will conduct an independent review of these issues as they relate to potential alliance partners. However, potential partners are welcome to provide any information deemed useful. Potential partners may be requested to respond to any potential issues that arise as part of the due diligence research, and failure to resolve serious concerns will be cause for non-award. Additional information on USAID’s approach to due diligence may be found in the “Tools for Alliance Builders” guide available on the GDA website at www.usaid.gov/gda.

Letter of Intent/Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)

Upon favorable review of the full proposal, partners including USAID will draft a letter of intent/memorandum of understanding (MOU), which will be used to clarify roles and responsibilities of each alliance partner.

Role of Partners/Substantial Involvement

Partners to the alliance effort (including USAID) bring strengths to the table. The actual division of responsibilities and risks will be covered under the Letter of Intent/Memorandum of Understanding prior to finalizing the Agreement. Therefore, the following illustrative list of examples of allocation of responsibility will be adjusted based on the successful alliance proposal, the best use of contributions from multiple partners, and the appropriate assignment of management and implementation responsibilities.  USAID’s role under some alliances may differ from the traditional role of provider of funds or source of oversight.

Budget Negotiations

Following a favorable tier two proposal review, Applicants will be advised if negotiations are to be initiated, additional information is required, or if a decision has been reached not to fund the proposal.

Award

Following favorable negotiations, a grant or cooperative agreement will be awarded either to the institution proposing the alliance or to a third entity that was proposed to implement the jointly-funded alliance.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Office of Inspector General 

(OIG) is requesting proposals from contractors to perform data analysis 

and consulting services to assist OIG in auditing Pharmacy Benefit 

Managers (PBMs) which administer the mail order and retail drug 

programs to members of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program 

(FEHBP).  The contractor will review the compliance and pricing 

practices for contracts between the BlueCross BlueShield Association, a 

participating carrier in the FEHBP, and two PBMs, Medco and Advance 

PCS.  

The FEHBP was established by Public Law 86-382 and became effective on 

July 1, 1960.  It is the largest employer-sponsored group health 

insurance program in the world, covering over 9 million Federal 

employees, retirees, former employees, family members, and former 

spouses.  The Government pays up to 75% of the cost of health benefits 

coverage, and the enrollee pays the remainder, based on a formula set 

by law.  FEHBP carriers are responsible for adjudicating the claims of 

and providing health benefits to,  enrollees and covered family members 

in accordance with their contracts with OPM.

OPM has the overall responsibility for the administration of the FEHB 

Program.  This includes approving or disapproving carriers/health plans 

for participation in the FEHB Program; contracting with carriers; 

negotiating benefit and rate changes with carriers; approving the 

health plan brochures; and for publishing FEHB regulations, 

instructions, forms, and documents.  OPM is also responsible for 

receiving and depositing premium withholdings and contributions, 

remitting premiums to carriers, and accounting for the Federal 

Employees Health Benefits Fund. 

The Office of Inspector General (OIG) conducts audits of the various 

participating health plans participating in the FEHBP.  These financial 

related audits are to determine if the carriers charged costs to the 

FEHBP and provided services to FEHBP members in accordance with the 

terms of the contract.  Specifically, the OIG reviews claim payments, 

administrative expenses, and cash management activities of these 

carriers. 

BACKGROUND

OPM executed the initial contract (CS 1039) with Blue Cross Blue Shield 

Association (BCBSA) in 1960, following the passage of Public Law 

86-382.  BCBSA participates in the FEHBP as the Carrier for the Service 

Benefit Plan and offers benefits to Federal employees on a Government 

wide basis.  An administrative office, the Federal Employee Program 

Director's Office (FEPDO), was established to provide centralized 

services to the Federal Government.  

Today, BCBSA represents over 50 local BCBS plans that provide health 

benefits to about four million Federal employees, retirees and 

dependents.  The FEPDO continues to provide liaison activities to the 

Federal Government on behalf of the local BCBS plans.

The FEPDO is responsible for ensuring the Federal Government's 

instructions, requests and policies are implemented by its business 

partners, in addition to the local Plans, and for ensuring compliance 

with the Federal contract.  

In 1990, Tthe BCBSA entered into direct contract arrangements with two 

significant business partners, Merck/Medco in 1987 and Advance PCS in 

1993, to provide a mail order drug program and a retail pharmacy 

program, respectively.  For contract year 2002, these two PBMs were 

paid approximately $36 billion for benefits to rom the Federal 

Government for their services through their BlueCross BlueShield 

subscribers in the FEHBP.contracts.

OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF WORK

The OIG seeks a contractor with specific expertise in the PBM and 

pharmacy benefits contracting areas to assist OIG in auditing PBMs. The 

objectives of the contract are to: 
(1) determine whether Medco and PCS paid pharmacy claims accurately and 

in accordance with the contract for years 2000 through 2002, (2) 

identify unusually high utilization of a particular drug by a pharmacy, 

physician, or member, (3) identify the 50 highest utilized drugs 

dispensed to FEHBP subscribers, (4) identify potential fraudulent 

claims, (5) identify ways to improve the contracts, and (6) assist OIG 

personnel in using the software analysis to audit the PBMs. The OIG 

plans on performing audits of these two PBMs using the data analysis 

provided by the contractor/consultant.  The contractor is required to 

review 100 percent of the claims provided.  The contractor is also 

required to provide a separate analysis for each of the PBMs.  

In order to achieve the objectives, the OIG believes that the 

contractor's data analysis should allow the OIG audit staff to:

administration, including, but not limited to:

the correct discount and administrative fees were applied.
* Verify that correct dispensing fees were applied.
* Verify the amount due from rebate programs.
* Verify the amount of savings from generic drug substitution.
* Identify any input errors.

B. Identify any unusual trends or patterns when comparing the three 

years of data.

C. Identify prescription splitting.

D. Match drug therapy to medical diagnosis.

E. Analyze the controls in place to manage these drug programs.

F. IdentifyIdentify phantom and/or kited claims.

<DESC>R- Internal Consulting/Relocation Services – U.S. Dept. of Commerce/BEA invites your company to quote on the following:

Introduction

The Bureau of Economic Analysis (hereinafter referred to as ABEA@), located at 1441 L Street, NW, Washington, DC is scheduled to begin its comprehensive carpet replacement and cyclical painting beginning in January, 2004.  

BEA occupies 140,000 net usable square feet.  BEA has ten divisions and 440 employees and approximately 40 non-agency personnel.  Of the 10 floors fully- or partially- occupied by BEA, approximately 81,000 square feet will be recarpeted.  BEA has 2 swing space areas which can accommodate 37 and 55 persons.  If needed, an additional area accommodating 15 workstations can be used for selected cycles.  BEA is seeking a Contractor to handle communication, management, and coordination for and between bureau and program management, employees, and vendors.  Timely project completion is paramount.

Background

To accomplish the recarpeting, BEA needs to move program units from their currently assigned location to swing space available within building number.  Careful planning and coordination are required to schedule the moves which cannot be accomplished within two weeks of releases.  It will take 4 to 6 weeks to complete a cycle.  BEA has approximately 54 releases involving staff from 10 different divisions.  Some divisions are being returned to their currently assigned space, others are moving to new locations which must be included in the plan.

The project must be managed to accommodate the various division work and release schedule.  The Contractor shall provide a Program Manager who shall coordinate set up schedule, coordinate activities between the program units, move Contractor, furniture Contractor, lessor, and Bureau management.

The project should be scheduled to finish in the Fall of 2004.

Project Dates

Immediately through Fall 2004.


Description of Work

Project Management


The Contractor shall manage BEA=s carpet replacement and cyclical painting project.  BEA management must be consulted and kept fully informed.  BEA employees must be directed through the process to lessen anxiety and maximize effectiveness of the project.  Effective communication with management, program leaders, and employees will be mandatory.

Develop a communication and management plan which will include substantive information on the procedure to be implemented to ensure effective and efficient management of the program.  The plan will include schedules, budgets, information for distribution to all groups, coordination tasks, and other items which will ensure a successful program.

Coordination of vendor activities

Develop a coordination plan including schedules by working with all contractor involved, including the moving company, rental furniture contractor, building owner/building management company, and other related contractors.  The coordination plan will identify all requirements for the contractors including schedules, instructions, conducting interaction between groups, and requirements for the vendors.  The plan will be implemented to ensure that all contractors perform with maximum efficiency.

Scope and Complexity

Because scheduling and coordination are critical to success, we have provided a list of releases and a chart showing the size of the program units.  These should be considered in the management, communications, and coordination plans.
