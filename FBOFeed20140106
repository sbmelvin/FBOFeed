<DESC><strong>Contracting Office Address</strong><br /> Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National 	Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions 9609 Medical Center Dr RM 1E144, Bethesda, 	MD 20852, UNITED STATES.<br /><br /><strong>Description</strong><br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure on a sole source basis with The University of Ghana Medical School, UGMS Box 4236, Accra, Ghana 233 21 to identify population controls for an epidemiologic study of breast cancer risk in Ghana.
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.  This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $14 million.</p>
<p>It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this contract.</p>
<p>The period of performance will be two years from date of award.</p>
<p>The goal of this procurement is to identify a set of population controls for an epidemiologic study of breast cancer risk in Ghana. Controls will be selected to be representative of the population in the geographic region surrounding the three study hospitals, and thus representative of the population in which the study breast cancer cases arise. Population controls have long been the standard in epidemiologic association studies, and are preferable over other types of controls, such as hospital controls, which can be associated with various selection biases. Furthermore, use of population controls will allow for the estimation of risk factor prevalence in the population.</p>
<p>The staff at The University of Ghana Medical School has ample experience with population studies and has worked closely with the Census team at the Ghana Statistical Service in Accra. Household enumeration is the only source for the population-wide demographic data needed to develop the roster of eligible population controls required for this procurement, as there is no national identity database or other available data source that attempts to include all Ghanaians. Enumeration requires the use of known, well-defined geographic boundaries; in Ghana, the system of administrative regions and districts developed by the Ghana Statistical Service is the only well-defined system of geographic divisions.</p>
<p>DCEG will utilize the same infrastructure, statistical methods, and sampling procedures utilized by the University of Ghana Medical School for the GBHS pilot during this full-scale phase of the study. The UGMS staff has also conducted epidemiologic follow-up studies that require following a large number of participants over time. Methods of locating subjects in the field will be applied to this study to increase the response rate, as was demonstrated during the pilot phase where there was &gt;80% participation among subjects approached to participate in the study. For these various reasons, The University of Ghana Medical School is the only facility in Ghana with the methodologic and field experience to complete the tasks required for control subject selection that meets the requirements of the study protocol.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities or a proposal/bid may be sent in.  All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisitions on or before 11:00 AM EST on January 21, 2014.  Electronic capability statements will be accepted or an original and one copy can be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions at the address stated above.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (240) 276-5401 or emailed to Erin Breedlove, Contract Specialist at breeerin@mail.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference solicitation number N02CP42507-21 on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>It is the Government's intent to issue an eighteen (18) month bridge contract on a sole-source basis to the American Registry of Pathology, a non-profit organization, to allow for continuation of services without degradation or disruption while the re-compete effort is in progress.Please note that we have now determined that two or more small business are identified as viable candidates who possess the capability to compete competitively to support a follow-on five year non-commercial services contract based upon the results of extensive market research conducted over the last twelve (12) months.   This research is documented in a market research report and non-commerciality determination document.   However, due to the AFMES mission critical unique personnel laboratory certification requirements and personnel security requirements, a minimum six (6) months is required for an overlap of personnel support services between contracts.   The acquisition strategy for the planned competitively awarded small business set aside, follow-on five (5) year contract supports an award date of 30 March 2015 with a six month transition in period overlapping with this bridge contract.  The planned six month overlap will allow for adequate time to obtain requisite contractor personnel laboratory certifications and security clearances.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for the following services under project number 660-334  Genomic Medicine Addition, Salt Lake City, UT, VA Medical Center (VAMC), at 500 Foothill Blvd, Salt Lake City, UT   84148.    This will be a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business Set-aside.  This is an Architectural/Engineering Design and Construction Period Services Project. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL; NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED UNTIL AFTER AN EVALUATION HAS BEEN MADE ON THE PROVIDED SF-330.   The NAICS code for this project is 541310- Architectural Services.  
SCOPE OF WORK   
This project design will support the new construction (an addition to Building 2 (abbreviated B.02)) of approximately 13,000 SF of specialized environmental control space to accommodate the Salt Lake City Genomic Medicine Center with accompanying support functions (e.g., mechanical, electrical, storage, support, etc.).  The design will provide site utilities, entrance, and roadways work to accommodate project.  

The project design will address replacement and expansion of utility systems necessary to make the remodeled space energy efficient by current VA standards.  The project design will analyze state-of-the-art bio bank and genomic medicine technology to ensure the most viable building service systems are constructed to support the robotics, low temperature equipment, size, and sophistication of research equipment to fill this new space.  The design will provide storage and recovery of the samples critical to ongoing research designed to improve the health of veterans well after the samples are taken.  

The design will provide for the vertical transportation and delivery dock required to support the Genomic Medicine program.  The AE team will analyze associated parking serving the Genomic Medicine program and provide appropriate resolution.  The project design will address security standards as appropriate to safe guard Genomic Medicine functions/activities.  The project design will provide a new wing attached to the existing B.02 west end, to mimic the existing addition on the East end of B.02, Research Center consisting of ultra freezer(s), associated informatics support offices, support laboratories, and telemedicine service.  The project design will provide an addition constructed in accordance with the sustainability, energy, security, seismic and research requirements applied to VA Medical Center construction.  

The Genomic Medicine program is new to the Salt Lake City VA site.  The majority of the project's construction will be at and around the west end of B.02 (currently available for the project area).  This program's importance is supported and based on the VHA Cooperative Studies Program and Million Veteran Program initiatives.  The Salt Lake City VA has been identified as a site to address VA bio-specimen storage.  The responsibility of storage and preservation of specimens currently resides in one location and VA is supporting a duplicate system in Salt Lake City to insure data recovery of over 6 million samples and avoid a catastrophic simultaneous loss of all collected specimens.  Storage and recovery of the samples is critical to ongoing research designed to improve the health of veterans well after the samples are taken.

Design must incorporate emergency power to support ongoing utility operation due to function of this space.  A/E is responsible for investigating all existing conditions including performing geotechnical surveys and locating and analyzing utilities including determining adequacy of utility capacity.  If utility capacity is determined insufficient for new construction, A/E is responsible for incorporating all utility upgrades in design. 

A/E is to apply for Storm Water Permit through Utah Department of Environmental Quality (UDEQ) and maintain all Storm Water paperwork as required by permit as well as perform checks of construction for compliance with permit through duration of construction as part of construction period services.  Please delineate this as separate line item.

The Veterans Affairs Engineering Dept. will hire a third party (outside this A/E contract) life safety review for this design and the A/E must submit documents to this third party reviewer and answer questions and revise design to the satisfaction of the third party reviewer in order to comply with NFPA codes and the VA Fire Protection Design Manual; any disputes between the A/E and the third party life safety reviewer will be brought to the attention of the VA for determination on a decision.

This project design is to adhere to all building codes and standards including Joint Commission Accreditation Standards, NFPA Codes, VA Specifications and Standards, and AIA Standards unless otherwise approved in writing by VA.  Design is to follow all information outlined in VA Technical Information Library located at http://www.cfm.va.gov/til/dGuide.asp unless otherwise approved in writing by VA.  Please note: The VA is its own AHJ (Authority Having Jurisdiction) and is, therefore, not necessarily required to comply with the requirements of other AHJs with which the A/E firm may have worked.

A/E is to investigate the level of Blast Protection requirements that will be needed and design accordingly; information on these requirements available on above website.

Experience with the VA's Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS) is advantageous but not required.  In order to present design options to hospital management for support/consensus, skills/abilities in architectural modeling and/or BIM (Building Information Modeling) is required.

A/E selection requirements for design of this construction project will include knowledge and capability in addressing federal mandates including sustainability and energy conservation goals.  Selection criteria will consider experience with the principles of energy conservation and sustainability.  A/E is required to have professional credentials in Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) AP with specialty credentials representing a demonstration of an advanced level of green building knowledge and LEED practices, and have produced a minimum LEED silver certification for projects with similar size and scope of this project.  

The A-E shall incorporate green building and sustainable design practices and elements into project design to the greatest extent practicable and as per VA Sustainable Design & Energy Reduction Manual.  The project design shall meet the Guiding Principles for Federal Leadership in High Performance and Sustainable Buildings (Guiding Principles) and all energy/water/environmental requirements established by EPACT 2005, EISA 2007, EOs 13514 and 13423, and VA Directive 0055.  This design (including major mechanical equipment) will require energy modeling (annual building or zone simulation based on local weather data), and analysis during planning and all phases of design to achieve the energy budgets required in the above laws.  The typical design analysis will include a life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) on three different alternatives.  For example: an A/E may choose to analyze a project by analyzing and modeling the replacement of original equipment, a radiant system, or a heat pump system when designing an air handling system.  

Follow third-party criteria according to a multi-attribute green building standard or rating system developed by an ANSI-accredited organization.  Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) and Green Globes are the two approved rating systems; a minimum of LEED Silver criteria to be followed for this design.  

Use ENERGYSTAR benchmarking tool or equivalent in Portfolio Manager to monitor energy improvements and cost savings following one year of occupancy in the new installation.  To meet the "Optimize energy performance" principle, this design must:
"	Reduce energy use by at least 30% compared to the baseline building performance rating created using ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1 - 2007  Energy Standard, Appendix G
"	Be designed so that fossil fuel generated energy consumption is reduced from the 2003 Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) baseline, by 55% in FY 2010 and 65% in FY 2015 for the applicable category of building. 
"	Provide at least 15% of total electricity use for the facility through on-site renewable energy production (VA policy) 
"	Feature the use of a combined heat and power (cogeneration) system in each new medical facility unless proven not feasible technically and economically (VA policy)
"	Meet at least 30% of hot water demand through a solar hot water (thermal) system, unless proven ineffective through life cycle cost analysis.

The minimum period for life cycle cost calculations is 40 years, in conformance with EISA 2007 441.  
The A/E shall provide a detailed work plan and briefing for the VA project team, which presents the A/E's plan for completing the contract.  The A/E's plan shall be responsive with this Scope of Work and describe, in further detail, the approach to be used for each aspect of the contract as defined in the technical proposal.

NEITHER UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS NOR ANY OTHER KINDS OF OFFERS WILL BE CONSIDERED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI. NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.<br />1. SUBJECT: The Air Force Medical Evaluation Support Activity (AFMESA) is conducting market research on products to assist in obtaining vascular access in an expeditionary medical setting. Responses are due to this request for information (RFI) by 2:00 (EST) on 5 February 2014.<br />2. DISCLAIMER: This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kind of offers will be considered in response to this RFI.

AFMESA will not entertain any questions concerning the composition, requirements, or the nature of services to be performed under any future request for proposal (RFP).<br />3. BACKGROUND: Critically ill and injured patients are often associated with difficult or non-viable intravenous (IV) access. The ability to quickly establish vascular access is essential for the delivery of medications and for fluid replacement, including crystalloids, blood, and blood products.
<p>The Air Combat Command Surgeon's Medical Modernization Division (ACC/SGR) is currently interested in ALL devices that will assist in the rapid identification of viable vascular regions and ALL devices that will assist in achieving rapid vascular access.</p>
<p>AFMESA is not currently collecting information on standard IV catheters, IV connectors, or standard IV tubing. <br />ACC prefers commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) items but will accept information on government off-the-shelf (GOTS) and foreign off-the-shelf (FOTS) products as well as research and development (R&amp;D) options.<br />4. REQUIREMENTS: The product(s) sought must operate in an austere environment with the ability to easily and safely transition with the patient throughout the continuum of care. <br />Responses should address the requirements identified in this RFI, particularly those outlined in 4A below.<br />4A. MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:<br />Device will assist in the rapid identification of viable vascular regions <br />AND/OR assist in achieving rapid vascular access<br />5.

Email responses should be no larger than 10 MB in size. If larger attachments are required, please notify AFMESA at the above listed email address. Each RFI response will receive a confirmation email; if a confirmation is not received please call 301-619-8600. Please include a point of contact, phone number, e-mail address, website information, and indicate whether the company is a foreign or domestic entity in the contents of the e-mail.<br />Responses must be received by this office on or before 2:00 (EST) on 5 February 2014. This RFI is not a commercial solicitation. The Government will not pay for any information submitted, or for any costs associated with providing the information. <br />The response should describe the company's capability to offer, field, and sustain the vascular access device as characterized by the requirements addressed in this RFI. If unable to provide a vascular access device capable of meeting all requirements, the respondent should offer tradeoff considerations.<br />6. LATE SUBMISSIONS: Failure to respond to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future competition, nor will information provided in response to this RFI be used to exclude anyone from responding to any future requests for proposals. Communications with AFMESA in regard to this RFI will only be permitted in writing during the RFI response period.<br />Responses to the RFI received by AFMESA after the submittal deadline and time indicated may be considered. The respondent assumes the risk of the method of dispatch chosen. Postmarking by the submittal date and time shall not substitute for actual response receipt.<br />7. OWNERSHIP OF RESPONSE TO RFI: All informational material submitted in response to this request becomes property of AFMESA. Physical samples will be returned to the vendor at the owner's expense. <br />8. RELEASE OF CLAIMS, LIABILITY, AND PREPARATION EXPENSES: Under no circumstances shall AFMESA be responsible for any response preparation expenses, submission costs, or any other expenses, costs, or damages of whatever nature incurred as a result of the respondent's participation in this RFI process. Respondent understands and agrees that they submit a response at their own risk and expense, and release AFMESA from any claim for damages or other liability arising out of the RFI process.<br />9.

<DESC>DLA Disposition Services seeks sources with the capability and interest to provide the machinery/equipment described in this announcement. This is strictly a market research step at this time, and is not an actual request for proposals (RFP). An RFP may be issued at a later date for actual priced offers after this requirement is more fully defined, in part but not limited to the use of responses to this announcement. The anticipated NAICS is 333515 (size standard of 500 employees), with the set-aside aspects of any resulting procurement action also to be determined in part based upon responses to this initial announcement. The potential requirement is summarized as follows:
<p>DLA Disposition Services has a Centralized Demilitarization facility located at Anniston Army Depot, Anniston, AL. The primary mission of the facility is to destroy small arms and small arm components to the degree that they can no longer be used for offensive or defensive military purposes. DLA has a potential requirement to destroy weapons typically including but not limited to M249 or M60 machine guns, M16 and AK47 (including all variants), various types of shotguns, and pistols. DLA Disposition Services is seeking available equipment/technology (including but not limited to crushing, shredding, grinding, shearing or cutting) that will reduce such weaponry and components to a residue of which individual pieces at the end of the process are no larger than 1 cubic inch, or otherwise altered to no longer be able to be reassembled into a useable weapon or weapons parts (such as melted and cast into ingots). The throughput requirement is to achieve demilitarization of approx. 2,000 M16s (or equivalent) in a 6 to 7 hour period. Such technology must be available for use indoors, must be capable of use for at least 30 hours per week without significant maintenance or down time, and must meet appropriate industry safety and health standards for hearing and air borne particulates. It is expected that the equipment would be Government operated at our Anniston, AL, location, with training of operators and maintenance of the equipment/machinery to be provided by the contractor should this action ultimately result in a contract award. The resulting shredded or otherwise demilitarized material is expected to be subject to additional Government disposition and not handled further under the potential contract stemming from this action.</p>
<p>Firms with the capability and interest to provide the services are encouraged to submit a summary indication of such, by close of business on 27 Jan 2014. Please include the following with your response:</p>
<p>- A summary of your capability to provide the machinery/equipment and related support, including your proposed technology/machinery, approximate acquisition cost, footprint/size, electrical power requirements and exhaust/air exchange rate.</p>
<p>- The throughput performance of your equipment/method and any response to the above potential target rate (2,000 M16 rifles or equivalent firearms fully demilitarized in a 6-7 hour period).</p>
<p>- Any/all socioeconomic designation(s) applicable to your firm under the NAICs of 333515.</p>
<p><br />Questions/clarifications may be referred to the point of contact.</p>

<DESC>The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) is a mission critical, Safety of Life (SoL) navigation system within the FAA's National Airspace System (NAS).  WAAS provides LNAV, LNAV/VNAV, LPV, and LPV-200 levels of navigation services.  The WAAS currently uses Global Positioning System (GPS) L1 C/A and L2 P(Y) semi-codeless signals.  The United States Government Federal Register Notice (FRN) that DoD support of GPS L2 codeless/semi-codeless capability will likely end in 2020.

The FAA intends to replace the use of L2 P(Y) semi-codeless with the use of the GPS L5 civil signal under WAAS Phase IV - Dual Frequency Operations.  In addition to a new dual frequency SBAS navigation service, WAAS will continue to support legacy single frequency user services. 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) Dual Frequency Operations (DFO) will utilize Department of Defense Global Positioning System (GPS) L1 Coarse Acquisition and L5 signals to maintain existing Single Frequency User and provide a new Dual Frequency User Service.  The realization of an L5 capable GPS constellation has been delayed and therefore WAAS DFO has been segmented into two implementation phases.  DFO Segment 1 upgrades the WAAS infrastructure to enable reception and collection of the L5 signal with the WAAS reference station network and implements system changes required to sustain the WAAS.

In addition to the SIR and attachments, potential Offerors will need information contained in the DFO Technical Data Package (TDP).  These materials are subject to Import/Export control and will be available only through a FAA KSN website.  For KSN access, send a written request via email to the CO or Maria.ctr.Florentino@faa.gov providing the following information:

Company Name
Requestors Name and Position/Title
Mailing Address
Phone Number

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY - Solicitations are not available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government.
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division (AMD) in Boulder, CO is conducting market research to develop an acquisition strategy for the potential procurement of Design Build Services for renovation construction work for Building 1 (also known as the Radio Building) at the NIST campus in Boulder, CO. <br /><br />Background. Bldg 1 was constructed in 1954 and is a cast-in-place reinforced concrete building. It serves as the main laboratory facility for research and measurements at NIST Boulder, supporting the NIST mission to provide measurements, standards, and technology that advance economic growth and address national needs. Building 1 comprises a total of approximately 320,000 square feet, and includes administrative and support staff offices as well as laboratories. Building 1 includes a wide range of laboratory facilities that support research and measurements in areas such as electronics, nanotechnology, time and frequency measurements, quantum computing and quantum communications, laser science, optics, superconducting sensors, radio-frequency communications, magnetic field measurements, and many other areas. In many of these areas NIST Boulder performs the world's best research and measurements, including the world's leading quantum computing research programs, the world's most accurate atomic clocks, and some of the world's most sensitive measurements using unique superconducting devices. The extremely demanding and sensitive research and measurements performed in Building 1 require tight control of environmental conditions such as temperature, vibration, humidity, and air quality. Renovation of Building 1 is a necessity for NIST's continued long-term support of US industrial competitiveness in the world market. <br /><br />The Building 1 Renovation (B1R) will provide extensive renovation of approximately three- fourths of Building 1, including the Central Utility Room, Wings 3, 4, 5, 6 and the portion of the Center Spine connecting Wings 3&amp;4 to Wings 5&amp;6. This will provide approximately 80,000 net assignable square feet of high performance laboratory space to perform research and measurements needed by industry and the scientific community. The renovation will support key technology areas such as nanotechnology, biotechnology, new energy sources, computing and telecommunications in a high performance facility. Renovated spaces shall be sufficient to support NIST's vision well into the 21st Century and will be supportive of infrastructure recently developed on site. A LEED-CI (Commercial Interiors) Silver certification from the United States Green Building Council is a minimum requirement for the completed project. Renovation designs shall integrate the design goals and standards of LABS 21 Best Practice Guide.<br /><br />Current renovation efforts have been acquired under the traditional design-bid-build approach. Phase 1 of the renovation included exterior renovation of Wings 6 &amp; 3 and is scheduled to be completed in 1st Quarter 2014. Phase 2 &amp; 3 of the renovation includes interior renovation of Wings 6 &amp; 3 and is scheduled to begin 1st Quarter 2014. A design build approach is under consideration for the remaining 6 phases of construction renovation. The magnitude of construction for the remaining phases is more than $10,000,000 per phase. <br /><br />Response to this sources sought notice shall be limited to 10 pages and shall include the following information:</p>
<p>1. Firm's capability and experience as a prime contractor or leading a design build team for renovation or new construction projects for scientific research and laboratory type facilities similar in size and scope. Include a brief description and location of the project, value of the project, a list of key personnel and subcontractors involved, and facility owner point of contact information. <br />2.

<CONTACT>A.M. Sobsey, Contract Specialist, Phone 3014026545, Email alice.sobsey@nih.gov
<DESC>STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES (SOO)
<p>COORDINATION OF PUBLICATION'S FOR NIAID ACTIVITIES<br />1. Background<br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), conduct basic and applied research resulting in medical solutions. Results of this research are typically published in scientific peer reviewed journals so that this knowledge can be shared with the larger scientific community. <br /><br />The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is the sponsor for this requirement.<br /><br />The scope of this requirement is to establish an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract as a vehicle to support all activities within the NIAID that requires the publication of various scientific disciplines. The Contractor shall coordinate the journal publications with the publishers and ensure prompt payment for services rendered. <br /><br />Typically, a manuscript is submitted by an investigator to the editor of a journal for review. The journal is chosen based on the topic of the manuscript, the reputation of the journal, and the potential interests of its readers. The Editor sends the manuscript to a group of reviewers who critically review it for its scientific merit. Based on the reviewers' comments, the Editor may accept the manuscript for publication, request that it be revised, or reject it. If the manuscript is rejected for publication, the investigator may submit it to another journal for publication. If accepted by the Editor for publication, the investigator is notified and provided a galley proof for final editing before being published. In addition, most journals assess a page charge to defray the cost of publication of the article. The turnaround time for returning the galley proof back to the Editor, along with payment for the publication charges, is typically less than 72 hours. <br /><br />In the past, these publication costs were paid by the research laboratories using a government purchase card (P-Card). However, within the past few years, publication costs have increased, resulting in a number of articles costing greater than $3,000 per article. <br /><br />For purchases up to $25,000.00, NIAID will utilize the Government Commercial Credit Cards for payment. Each activity will use the Task Order number, followed by Fiscal Year, and Order Number for identification and tracking purposes.<br /><br />The COR will be placing phone/E-mail orders for one time journal publications. They will provide their credit card number at the time the orders are placed.<br />The Government will appoint an Ordering Officer in writing by the Contracting Officer.<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System Codes (NAICS) for this requirement is 541614 - Process, Physical Distribution and Logistic Consulting Services.<br /><br />2. Task Description<br />The purpose of this requirement is to provide an Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) contract vehicle by which publication charges exceeding $3,000/article can be paid to the publisher by the contractor on behalf of NIAID. The ID/IQ contract shall be used to support all activities within the NIAID that require these services. <br /><br />The Contractor shall be expected to provide payment to the designated publisher within 2 business days of being notified by E-mail by an authorized Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). <br /><br />The Contractor shall operate an E-mail server that shall allow large file attachments (up to 25 Mb) to be received. Publication charges above the authorized credit card payment limit of $25,000.00 will be funded via task orders to the contract. The COR is responsible to keep a record of all credit card transactions below $25,000, and shall submit a spreadsheet report of the credit card payment "running numbers" to the Contract Specialist via electronic mail on a monthly basis.<br /><br />The COR shall provide a copy of the galley proof and order form, along with any other documentation required by the publisher to be submitted, to the contractor. The contractor shall submit this information, along with the required payment, to the publisher. <br /><br />Some publishers may be based in other countries, so the Contractor shall be expected to be able to make payment in the proper currency denomination required by the publisher. Most publishers accept credit card payments. <br /><br />3. Task Deliverables <br />&bull; The Contractor shall pay the designated publisher within 2 business days of being notified by the COR. <br />&bull; The Contractor shall provide confirmation of payment to the COR and the submitting author at each NIAID activity by E-mail as soon as the transaction has been confirmed. <br />&bull; The Contractor shall submit separate itemized invoices, by each NIAID activity, no less than monthly to each COR for costs incurred using (eVIP). <br />4. Estimated Level of Effort <br />The number of journal articles estimated to be submitted through this IDIQ contract for payment is estimated to be &lt;$500K publications/year. <br />5. Other Direct Costs<br />No travel or other itemized costs shall be provided by the government.<br />6. Place of Performance &amp; Hours of Operation</p>

<CONTACT>Mark Burns: mark.e.burns@navy.mil

<a href="mailto:stacy.kirsch@navy.mil">stacy.kirsch@navy.mil</a>
<DESC>Synopsis:
The Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA) is hereby issuing a Request for Information (RFI) seeking information regarding the disassembly and radiological surveying of General Electric LM2500 Marine Gas Generators used aboard US Navy surface ships.  NAVSEA seeks to determine the industry capability, estimated costs, and steps required to complete the following:

-	Receive radiologically contaminated US Navy LM2500 Gas Generator Assets
-	Establish or possess a facility capable of processing LM2500 Gas Generator
-	Execute a complete disassembly of the asset in accordance with existing US Navy technical documents governing the depot overhaul of the LM2500 Gas Generator which will be provided.
-	Radiologically survey and disposition each part according to their level of radiological contamination as either above or below the permissible limits as defined the American National Standard Institute Standard (ANSI) 13.12 and Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Regulatory Guide 1.86 (less than 1000dpm per 100 square cm loose or removable contaminants and less than 6000dpm per 100 square cm total).
-	Package uncontaminated parts for shipment to a USN designated repair facility for further processing.
-	Package contaminated parts for commercial transport and disposal.
-	Dispose of any radiologically contaminated by-products resultant from the disassembly and survey of the LM2500 Gas Generator.

Follow-on efforts will be dependent upon the result of the first asset processed.

Description:
As a result of operation in radiologically contaminated areas, the US Navy currently has forty-five (45) LM2500 Marine Gas Turbines with Gas Generators operating under radiological controls.
  Due to the nature of the contamination, no US Navy facility is currently available to process the affected engines either for decontamination or repair following a failure.  The LM2500 is the main propulsion unit for the CG-47 class cruiser, the DDG-51 class destroyer, and the LCS-2 variant class ship as well as the main propulsion unit for several ships under the Military Sealift Command (MSC).  Without a US Navy facility to repair the affected engines, each one must be disposed of as hazardous waste requiring replacement with new assets.  The US Navy is seeking to leverage capabilities in commercial industry to determine if either decontamination or repair of these assets is a less costly option compared with new procurement.
  

The Navy anticipates that, should decontamination/repair of radiologically controlled assets prove economically beneficial, a total throughput of forty-five (45) LM2500 assets will be processed.  All assets would be delivered in US Navy shipping containers.  These containers would have to be opened in a radiologically controlled environment and all items inside the container as well as the interior of the container itself subject to radiological controls.  All handling and required tooling would similarly be under radiological controls for the duration of work and would require decontamination before a return to regular stock or special disposal if decontamination is not possible.

Processing of radiologically controlled items may generate radiological waste products (metal shavings, waste water, etc.) which would also be classified as radiologically contaminated and would require either special packaging or decontamination prior to disposal.
  Handling and disposal of waste products would be the responsibility of the contractor.


Repair and overhaul work of radiologically contaminated assets requires a separate working area that meets national and state requirements for the handling of such assets.  NAVSEA requests that respondents indicate whether or not they currently posses a facility or would need to construct a facility for this effort.

Compliance to Standards:  
The ANSI 13.12 and NRC Regulatory Guide 1.86 are existing standards that support this effort.  Respondents will need to obtain an agreement state license or NRC state license prior to accepting any US Navy radiologically controlled assets.  Disassembly procedures for the LM2500 Marine Gas Generator are marked DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT D (Distribution authorized to Department of Defense (DOD) and DOD contractors only; Critical Technology).
  A technical data package can be provided upon request and upon verification that the requestor is a bona fide US Department of Defense (DOD) contractor familiar with the procedures to handle technical data package materials that may include limited distribution information.  Evidence in the form of a fully signed and approved DD Form 2345 (MILITARY CRITICAL TECHNICAL DATA AGREEMENT) will be required prior to receipt of the technical data package.  Please request the technical data package via email to the following address: mark.e.burns@navy.mil.  

Responses:
NAVSEA is seeking industrys feedback and commentary on the scope, schedule and rough order of magnitude (ROM) costs associated with disassembling and radiologically assessing a single LM2500 Gas Generator as well as rough order of magnitude costs associated with radiologically assessing follow-on LM2500 Gas Generator assets by September 30, 2013.

The Navy is also interested in responses to the following questions:

1.	Disassembly of the LM2500 Gas Generator requires special tooling to complete a full disassembly.
  NAVSEA requests that respondents indicate whether or not they currently posses the required tooling, have a means to procure the tooling, or would require the tooling be provided as Government Furnished Material.  If respondents posses partial tooling, NAVSEA requests a listing or ROM to procure what additional tooling would be required.
2.	Identify an existing or develop a ROM estimate for the construction of a facility capable of isolating and disassembling the LM2500 Marine Gas Turbine Engine (MGTE), all associated tooling and equipment, and personnel to maintain radiological controls at all times until all contaminated items are officially cleared by the US Navy for release.
3.	Provide a ROM cost for the recurring engineering costs to continue to process LM2500 radiologically controlled assets.
4.	For respondents that need to construct a facility, provide an estimated timeline for construction and state certification of the facility.
5.	For respondents that will contract out radiological inspections, provide a ROM for sub-contracted costs and identification of intended performers.
6.	NAVSEA requests a notional timeline for the following where applicable:
a.	Construction and certification of a radiologically controlled facility
b.	Subcontract award for radiological assessments
c.	Procurement of required tooling
d.	Disassembly of an LM2500 Gas Generator asset
e.	Radiological assessment of LM2500 Gas Generator disassembled components
f.	Cleaning/decontamination of the LM2500 Gas Generator components
g.	Packaging of uncontaminated/decontaminated parts for shipment
h.	Packaging of contaminated parts for shipment

Responses and comments are requested by 4:00 pm (EST), on February 4, 2013.
  However, submissions will be accepted after this date, but feedback may not be as timely or contribute to NAVSEAs strategic planning.  Responses should indicate enough detail so that potential Navy interest can be assessed.  Responses are requested to be provided electronically and acceptable formats include Adobe PDF, Microsoft Word and Microsoft PowerPoint files.  All inquiries and comment submissions should be emailed to mark.e.burns@navy.mil.  The information provided will assist NAVSEA in developing and further defining future procurement and acquisition strategies and should not contain proprietary information.  However, if some of the background on the comments provided is considered proprietary to the respondent, that portion shall be segregated and labeled as such and will be treated as Business Sensitive and will not be shared outside of Government activities and agencies without the permission of the provider.
  

This RFI in no way binds the Government to offer contracts to responding companies.  The information provided will assist NAVSEA in developing future strategies for the handling of radiologically contaminated LM2500 Gas Generator assets.  Defense and commercial contractors, including small businesses, veteran-owned businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and woman-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate.  This RFI is the initiation of market research under Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  All information shall be provided free of charge to the Government. NAVSEA may request further information regarding the capabilities of respondents to meet the requirements and may request a presentation and/or a site visit as deemed necessary.
  No written responses will be returned.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS ISSUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GUIDANCE FOR THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 AND FAR SUBPART 5.705.
<p>Contract Number SB1341-11-CN-0011 was awarded to Wiklund Research and Design of Concord, MA, on February 28, <br />2011, in the amount of $1,206,648.00. All work is required to be completed not later than <br />December 31, 2014.</p>
<p>Work required under this contract shall provide all labor, materials and equipment necessary to develop Usability Guidelines and an Evaluation Framework for Electronic Health Records Systems.</p>
<p>The above referenced work is being completed under a time and materials contract. Due to multiple unknowns associated with the project, a firm fixed price could not be established with any reasonable degree of confidence. Unknowns include: uncertainty regarding the frequency and location of meetings that the Contractor will require to complete the required work; uncertainty with respect to the number of Electronic Health Record Systems (EHRs) available and being utilized in the professional marketplace; and use of a firm fixed price contract was anticipated to limit competition and increase the cost to the Government due to a significant amount of risk.</p>
<p>Modification 006 is being issued to extend the period of performance through December 31, 2014, due to Government delays.</p>
<p>The total amount of the contract remains unchanged by reason of this modification.</p>

<DESC>This synopsis provides notice of the Government's intent to extend Seaport-e Task Order N00178-04-D-4011-M802, in accordance with FAR Clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services. The contractor is American Electronic Warfare Associates, Inc. (AMEWAS), 22560 Epic Drive, Suite 103, California, MD 20619. This effort will provide continuity of engineering and technical services to the Naval Air Warfare Center - Aircraft Division (NAWC - AD), Integrated Combat Environments (ICE) Division (5.4.4) and Battlespace Modeling and Simulation (Battlespace M&amp;S) Division (5.4.2) at Patuxent River, MD, while the follow-on contract is being completed. This extension covers a period of performance of approximately six (6) months that will commence on 16 February 2014 and end on 15 August 2014. This extension is necessary as the current contract is scheduled to expend all ceiling as of 15 February 2014. Due to the ongoing nature of the projects currently performed under Seaport-e Task Order N00178-04-D-4011-M802 and the need to continue these services without a break in support, AMEWAS is the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of these services until award of a competitive follow-on contract.<br />THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. The incumbent contractor currently has fully trained personnel and a fully developed management system in place for execution of the required work. Re-solicitation for the six (6) month period would not only result in a break in service but would incur excessive costs to the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government will not pay for any information received. No telephone responses will be accepted. For information, contact Candice Byrd, Code 2.5.1.6.4 via email at candice.byrd@navy.mil.<br />Per FAR Subpart 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy requirements". AMEWAS is the sole source capable of providing these efforts without creating an impact on project schedules and operations that would be caused by a break in service. It is unrealistic, from a technical and contractual perspective, to expect any other potential source to provide continued services at an acceptable level for this short period of performance prior to the competitive contract being awarded. Because of the nature of this requirement and the impracticality and substantial costs, the Government would incur and not recover through competition, this requirement will be procured on a sole source basis. <br />

 "About EBSCO".
2 Jan 2014. <http://www.ebsco.com/about\>.

Currently, the Library Service at the Philadelphia VA Medical Center utilizes EBSCO Publishing which provides us with EBSCOhost, the most-used premium research service in libraries and other institutions worldwide. Health sciences libraries have come to rely on EBSCO as a means of linking several products so that our users can learn to use a single search interface for a variety of subject databases. In 2003, EBSCO acquired CINAHL, our primary nursing database; and as a result, EBSCO is now the only means of accessing CINAHL. In addition, EBSCO is the sole distributor of DynaMED, the evidence-based point of care tool for clinical medicine as well as having the exclusive rights to the nursing database CINAHL. With this single purchase, EBSCO will continue to provide us with 3 subject collections of full-text journals, 5 subject portals for specialty searches, and 4 specialty subject indexes combined with full-text journals.

The 'portal' databases contained here are all unique EBSCOhost products, not available from any other vendor.  The several full-text journal collections are unique compilations and represent the titles and subject areas most used and requested by our clinical and administrative staff. In all, these collections provide us with 7,334 full text electronic journals available at the desktop for Philadelphia VA staff.  As a result, EBSCO Publishing is the only vendor capable of providing the supplies and services described above without the Veterans Health Administration experiencing substantial duplication of cost.

If Alternate II to the clause at FAR 52.225-3 is included in this solicitation, substitute the following paragraph (g)(1)(ii) for paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of the basic provision: (g)(1)(ii) The offeror certifies that the following supplies are Canadian end products or Israeli end products as defined in the clause of this solicitation entitled "Buy American Act-Free Trade Agreements-Israeli Trade Act": List Canadian or Israeli End Products <BR> <BR>(4) Trade Agreements Certificate. (Applies only if the clause at FAR 52.225-5, Trade Agreements, is included in this solicitation.) (i) The offeror certifies that each end product, except those listed in paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this provision, is a U.S.-made or designated country end product, as defined in the clause of this solicitation entitled "Trade Agreements." (ii) The offeror shall list as other end products those end products that are not U.S.-made or designated country end products. List other End Products: <BR> <BR>(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation. (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- (1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <BR> <BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] List end products. <BR> <BR>(2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.] [ ] (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. [ ] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. (j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- (1) [ ] In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <BR> <BR>(2) [ ] Outside the United States. (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] [ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that- (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. [ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that- (i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii)); (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies- (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. <BR> <BR>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) (1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

(2) "Confidential commercial or financial information" means any business information (other than trade secrets) which is exempt from the mandatory disclosure requirement of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. Exemptions from mandatory disclosure which may be applicable to business information contained in proposals include exemption (4), which covers "commercial and financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential," and exemption (9), which covers "geological and geophysical information, including maps, concerning wells." (b) If the offeror, or its subcontractor(s), believes that the proposal contains trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552), the cover page of each copy of the proposal shall be marked with the following legend: "The information specifically identified on pages ______ of this proposal constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The offeror requests that this information not be disclosed to the public, except as may be required by law. The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract." (c) The offeror shall also specifically identify trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information on the pages of the proposal on which it appears and shall mark each such page with the following legend: "This page contains trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and which is subject to the legend contained on the cover page of this proposal.

<DESC>Background:<br /><br />The Central Heating Refrigeration Plant (CHRP) was originally designed in 1933. CHRP is capable of producing approximately 1.5 million pounds of steam per hour; in 2011 the CHRP delivered approximately 1.5 million Klbs, with a peak winter load of 700 thousand lbs/hr. Steam is also used internally to operate steam driven equipment and auxillaries as well as the production of chilled water. The CHRP is the only steam-generating facilities serving in the GSA National Capital Region in operation. This plant provides steam servcie to over 29 GSA public buildings, 49 Federal non-GSA buildings and 12 Non-Federal buildings with a combined area of 52,000,000 gross square feet (GSF). The CHRP is comprised of 5 natural gas fired boilers using #2 fuel oil as back up fuel and 1 cogeneration boiler that operates with two 5MW combustion turbines generators that generates electricity utilizing the exhaust gas to produce steam. The cogeneration electricity is used primarily to power the chiller plant and augment heating operations.&nbsp;In 2011 the cogeneration system generated 75.7 K megawatt/hour of electricity. The CHRP operates a chiller plant that provides 17, 000 tons of cooling to eleven&nbsp;(11) customer buildings: in 2011 the CHRP circulated a total of 4.6 billion gallons of chilled water and supplied&nbsp;30.6 million tons of hours of cooling. The CHRP is a Level 5 security facility.<br /><br />

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

(End of Clause) NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.<br />Primary Point of Contact:</p>

<p>52.204-13 System for Award Management Maintenance (Jul 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Definition. As used in this clause-</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities, which is used as the identification number for Federal Contractors.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>
<p>(1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>
<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support he legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)<br />The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

(2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.

(b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. (End of clause) <BR> <BR>As referenced in FAR, http://www.acquisition.gov/far/Reference <BR> <BR>(Full Text ? Please see Attachment A) <BR> <BR>(Full Text ? Please see Attachment A) <BR> <BR>As referenced in http://cfr.regstoday.com/48cfr1352.aspx <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

<DESC>Amendment dated 1/7/2014<br /><br />RESPONSE TO INQUIRIES - F1C3473345A001
<p>Question #1: Will a twenty foot (20') unit be accpetable in place of a forty (40') unit?</p>
<p>As stated in the solicitation, a 16' x 40' unit or eqivalent allows for any reasonable change in dimensons, so long as the vendor can provide comparable office space area. For example, a 16' x 40' unit offers approximately 640 square feet of office space, whereby a 16' x 20' unit offers 320 square feet. Therefore, two units with the dimensions of a 16' x 20' are required to provide the equivalent floor space of a 16' x 40' unit. <br /><br />// End Amendment //<br /><br /><br />20 December 2013</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><p>The purpose of this modification is to make the following changes to SECTION I, "Funding Opportunity Description": 1) Move two (2) focus areas from <strong>Focus Areas for FY15</strong> to the <strong>General Focus Areas for all FYs</strong> and 2) Add a new focus area under <strong>Focus Areas for FY15</strong>. No other changes have been made.</p>
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Focus Areas Applicable to all FYs:</span></strong></p>
<p>The following paragraphs are moved from <strong>Focus Areas for FY15</strong> and added to <strong>General Focus Areas Applicable to all FYs:</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CAC Authentication via MicroSD Certificate Storage<br /></span></strong>Commercial mobile devices on their own, with standard configuration, are not secure enough for government use. However, to save money, many agencies are looking to leverage them. This poses a challenge for securing government/sensitive data access by the device user, while maintaining all the functionality of the commercial device itself. One approach is to utilize micro/nano Secure Digital (SD) cards to provide secure storage of access certificates. Phase one of this focus area will develop a secure, "read only" certificate store utilizing the Micro and Nano SD card form factors for use in physically unmodified Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Mobile Platforms. Software applications may be modified or created in order to demonstrate the functionality. The second phase of this focus area will test the proposed solution against real world scenarios utilizing life-like certificate data to ascertain robustness against published Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGS).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Securing Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Mobile Device Common Access Card (CAC) Authentication via Near-Field Communication (NFC)<br /></span></strong>Several COTS mobile devices feature NFC capabilities. Concurrently, there are requirements for warfighters to authenticate on computing resources with their Common Access Card (CAC). Unfortunately, physical external readers for CACs are unwieldy extensions to mobile devices. As such, there may be an opportunity to investigate utilizing the COTS NFC capabilities assuming they meet or exceed the security requirements accomplished by the physical readers. Given the repeated demonstrations given at most modern Black Hat events exploiting COTS NFC capabilities in many various ways, skepticism as to these devices' security capabilities will need to be assuaged and demonstrated as mitigated appropriately for operationally meaningful situations. Additionally, the demonstrated solution has additional challenges: It must be able to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data provided via CAC PKI capabilities, it must securely account for users with multiple credentials and access their existing certificates within appropriate networks (as in Global Access List, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)/ Active Directory (AD), etc.), must have a segregation capability if malicious code is detected, and allow for appropriate persistence of user authentication even after the device and NFC tag are outside of scanning range.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Focus Areas for FY15:</span></strong></p>
<p>The following is a new paragraph added under <strong>Focus Areas for FY15:<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dynamic Mobile Device Management (DMDM)<br /></span></strong><br />In order to provide secure containers for multiple compartments within mobile devices, a dynamic method to manage mobile devices using a secure Operating System (such as SE-Android) is required. This topic is to develop and demonstrate an innovative method for the management of such a device. This following management capabilities must be considered : support for multiple compartments on a single mobile platform, dividing each container into separate compartments, each with their own storage, keystore, and applications; the ability to provide flexible policies for the communication of all applications with each other and the device; provide high-level enforcement of applications to operate as specified by policy within a container; provide typical device management which includes: user management, device lock-down, container isolation protection, tamper resistance, and remote management (including the ability to wipe the device if compromised); provide continual assessment of the devices security state and make appropriate actions when that state is compromised. The prototype delivered must incorporate as many of these capabilities as possible and demonstrate successful container separation, device and policy management, and attestation of device security.</p>

<p>(8) INTERVIEW/DISCUSSION. The Final Selection Board will award up to 20 additional points to the three highest scoring firms, as determined by the Pre-Selection Board. These 20 points will be awarded on response to questions from Final Selection Board members. All firms that advance to the interview stage will be provided with interview questions. All firms will receive the same set of questions before the interview appointment.</p>
<p>TEAMING AGREEMENTS. The prime contractor shall provide a statement in the cover letter confirming executed teaming agreements are in place for all team members on proposal. The statement shall also list all team members.</p>
<p>Evaluation of past performance and experience may include information provided by the firm, customer inquiries, Government databases, and publicly available sources.

Selection of the A-E firms for these contracts will be based on the following evaluation factors. Not all evaluation factors are of equal weight, with variations from 5 to 30 points. The Pre-Selection Board will use the factors from Criteria 1 through 7 to determine the firms that will be recommended to the Final Selection Board. The Pre-Selection Board will recommend to the Final Selection Board the three highest scoring firms. The Final Selection Board will also use the factors from Criteria 1 through 7 to score the firms recommended by the Pre-Selection Board. The Final Selection Board will further evaluate these firms based on interview/discussion and record their scores from Criteria 8 (worth 20 points). These scores will be added to the previous subtotals to arrive at a total point value that will determine the order of recommending the preferred candidates to the contracting officer.<br /><br />ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>

<SOLNBR>N0002413R4207

<RESPDATE>020413
<CONTACT>Stacy Kirsch 202-781-5124 Mr. Mark E. Burns at mark.e.burns@navy.mil
202-781-4015
<DESC>The Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA) is hereby issuing a Request for Information (RFI) seeking information regarding the disassembly and radiological surveying of General Electric LM2500 Marine Gas Generators used aboard US Navy surface ships. NAVSEA seeks to determine the industry capability, estimated costs, and steps required to complete the following: - Receive radiologically contaminated US Navy LM2500 Gas Generator Assets - Establish or possess a facility capable of processing LM2500 Gas Generator - Execute a complete disassembly of the asset in accordance with existing US Navy technical documents governing the depot overhaul of the LM2500 Gas Generator which will be provided. - Radiologically survey and disposition each part according to their level of radiological contamination as either above or below the permissible limits as defined the American National Standard Institute Standard (ANSI) 13.12 and Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Regulatory Guide 1.86 (less than 1000dpm per 100 square cm loose or removable contaminants and less than 6000dpm per 100 square cm total).
 - Package uncontaminated parts for shipment to a USN designated repair facility for further processing. - Package contaminated parts for commercial transport and disposal. - Dispose of any radiologically contaminated by-products resultant from the disassembly and survey of the LM2500 Gas Generator. Follow-on efforts will be dependent upon the result of the first asset processed. Description: As a result of operation in radiologically contaminated areas, the US Navy currently has forty-five (45) LM2500 Marine Gas Turbines with Gas Generators operating under radiological controls. Due to the nature of the contamination, no US Navy facility is currently available to process the affected engines either for decontamination or repair following a failure.
 The LM2500 is the main propulsion unit for the CG-47 class cruiser, the DDG-51 class destroyer, and the LCS-2 variant class ship as well as the main propulsion unit for several ships under the Military Sealift Command (MSC). Without a US Navy facility to repair the affected engines, each one must be disposed of as hazardous waste requiring replacement with new assets. The US Navy is seeking to leverage capabilities in commercial industry to determine if either decontamination or repair of these assets is a less costly option compared with new procurement. The Navy anticipates that, should decontamination/repair of radiologically controlled assets prove economically beneficial, a total throughput of forty-five (45) LM2500 assets will be processed.
 All assets would be delivered in US Navy shipping containers. These containers would have to be opened in a radiologically controlled environment and all items inside the container as well as the interior of the container itself subject to radiological controls. All handling and required tooling would similarly be under radiological controls for the duration of work and would require decontamination before a return to regular stock or special disposal if decontamination is not possible. Processing of radiologically controlled items may generate radiological waste products (metal shavings, waste water, etc.) which would also be classified as radiologically contaminated and would require either special packaging or decontamination prior to disposal.
 Handling and disposal of waste products would be the responsibility of the contractor. Repair and overhaul work of radiologically contaminated assets requires a separate working area that meets national and state requirements for the handling of such assets. NAVSEA requests that respondents indicate whether or not they currently posses a facility or would need to construct a facility for this effort. Compliance to Standards: The ANSI 13.12 and NRC Regulatory Guide 1.86 are existing standards that support this effort. Respondents will need to obtain an agreement state license or NRC state license prior to accepting any US Navy radiologically controlled assets. Disassembly procedures for the LM2500 Marine Gas Generator are marked DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT D (Distribution authorized to Department of Defense (DOD) and DOD contractors only; Critical Technology).
 A technical data package can be provided upon request and upon verification that the requestor is a bona fide US Department of Defense (DOD) contractor familiar with the procedures to handle technical data package materials that may include limited distribution information. Evidence in the form of a fully signed and approved DD Form 2345 (MILITARY CRITICAL TECHNICAL DATA AGREEMENT) will be required prior to receipt of the technical data package. Please request the technical data package via email to the following address: mark.e.burns@navy.mil. Responses: NAVSEA is seeking industrys feedback and commentary on the scope, schedule and rough order of magnitude (ROM) costs associated with disassembling and radiologically assessing a single LM2500 Gas Generator as well as rough order of magnitude costs associated with radiologically assessing follow-on LM2500 Gas Generator assets by September 30, 2013.
 The Navy is also interested in responses to the following questions: 1. Disassembly of the LM2500 Gas Generator requires special tooling to complete a full disassembly. NAVSEA requests that respondents indicate whether or not they currently posses the required tooling, have a means to procure the tooling, or would require the tooling be provided as Government Furnished Material. If respondents posses partial tooling, NAVSEA requests a listing or ROM to procure what additional tooling would be required. 2. Identify an existing or develop a ROM estimate for the construction of a facility capable of isolating and disassembling the LM2500 Marine Gas Turbine Engine (MGTE), all associated tooling and equipment, and personnel to maintain radiological controls at all times until all contaminated items are officially cleared by the US Navy for release.
 3. Provide a ROM cost for the recurring engineering costs to continue to process LM2500 radiologically controlled assets. 4. For respondents that need to construct a facility, provide an estimated timeline for construction and state certification of the facility. 5. For respondents that will contract out radiological inspections, provide a ROM for sub-contracted costs and identification of intended performers. 6. NAVSEA requests a notional timeline for the following where applicable: a. Construction and certification of a radiologically controlled facility b. Subcontract award for radiological assessments c. Procurement of required tooling d. Disassembly of an LM2500 Gas Generator asset e. Radiological assessment of LM2500 Gas Generator disassembled components f.
 Cleaning/decontamination of the LM2500 Gas Generator components g. Packaging of uncontaminated/decontaminated parts for shipment h. Packaging of contaminated parts for shipment Responses and comments are requested by 4:00 pm (EST), on February 4, 2013. However, submissions will be accepted after this date, but feedback may not be as timely or contribute to NAVSEAs strategic planning. Responses should indicate enough detail so that potential Navy interest can be assessed. Responses are requested to be provided electronically and acceptable formats include Adobe PDF, Microsoft Word and Microsoft PowerPoint files.

The Government anticipates award on a Best Value/Trade-off basis.  The contract type for this effort has not yet been determined.  Interested parties are requested to review the requirements and information stated above and to submit a written response by the closing date of this posting.   The industry feedback received will allow PEO STRI to validate cost and schedule projections and allocate funds to satisfy this requirement.

Any required human life-forms necessary to meet the requirements of this specification and the UH-72A SFTS training tasks shall be included in the system and shall be compatible with the SE Core VDIS, MEL, and OneSAF. quote mark  <br> Will the Government be able to detail the type(s) and behavior(s) of life-forms required to meet the requirements of the specification?  <br>  <br> Answer:  Interested contractors should determine if their solution requires life-forms in order to train the tasks identified.  Behaviors for those chosen life-forms will be determined and proposed by the contractor. Also, If the contractor proposes to add a human life-form or any other moving model that currently is not supported in OneSAF, that contractor will be required to add those behaviors necessary for that life-form.   <br>  <br> 12.  Spec. Pg 34	2.3.2.3.6 Database Compatibility <br>  quote mark It is expected that the SE CORE databases will be compatible with all Natural Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) and Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF) formatted maps used by the UH-72A for mission planning systems, e.g., Aviation Mission Planning System (AMPS). quote mark  <br> Is there an implied requirement the Government would like to articulate? <br>  <br> Answer: Specification will be revised. <br>  <br> 13.  Spec. Pg 35	2.3.2.3.8 Software Models and Special Effects <br>  quote mark The UH-72A SFTS simulation may use software modeling approaches to support real world representation of entity visual characteristics and performance attributes; sensor performance; targets and forces visual and performance attributes; and necessary special and other effects. quote mark  <br> Is there an implied requirement the Government would like to articulate? <br>  <br> Answer:  The specification will be revised.   <br>  <br> 14.

<DESC><strong>JANUARY 6, 2014 </strong>- OFFICIAL SOLICITATION RELEASE DATE - Amendment #5<br /> <br /><em><strong>Note attached RFP for Key dates.  Questions due January 24, 2014.  Past Performance Information due February 19, 2014.   Final Proposals due March 5, 2014.&nbsp;<br /></strong></em><br /><br /><strong>*********</strong><br />SYNOPSIS<br />USAID Global Health Supply Chain
<p>DISCLAIMER<br />This is not a solicitation. USAID does NOT invite offerors to submit proposals in response to this synopsis NOR will USAID accept comments, questions and/or inquiries in response to this synopsis and will NOT respond to any. NO awards are anticipated to be made in response to this synopsis. Prospective offerors are advised to periodically monitor the above website for updates concerning this procurement.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to comply with the synopses and pre-solicitation notice requirements of FAR 5.2 - Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions. Any solicitation resulting from this notice will be handled in accordance with FAR 5.102(d); therefore, availability of the solicitation package is limited to the following electronic medium: FEDBIZOPPS web page (http://www.fbo.gov/).</p>
<p>Purpose<br />The purpose of this synopsis is to outline the United States Agency for International Development's (USAID) proposed plans to:</p>
<p>&bull; Procure health commodities and services and promote sustainable supply chains;<br />&bull; Inform and communicate USAID's plans with the public and key external stakeholders, in particular, members of the business community;<br />&bull; Facilitate and encourage advanced planning by partners for consideration of the follow on design; and<br />&bull; To encourage competition.</p>
<p>Background<br />USAID is the USG's principle implementing agency for international development assistance. The Bureau for Global Health, whose vision is to create a world where people lead healthy, productive lives and where mothers and children thrive, has a broad portfolio that includes a wide array of programs and investments that represent the commitment and determination of USG to prevent suffering, save lives, and create an environment that encourages development.</p>
<p>Successful implementation of USAID's health programs is dependent on, among other things, an uninterrupted supply of essential quality health commodities, including pharmaceuticals, in addition to supply chain assistance to health systems that manage these commodities.</p>
<p>Currently, there are multiple offices within the Bureau for Global Health - as well as Presidential Initiatives - that run programs that procure health commodities. These are the Office of Health, Infectious Diseases, and Nutrition (HIDN), the Office of HIV/AIDS (OHA), and the Office of Population and Reproductive Health (PRH), and both the President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (PEPFAR) and the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI). As part of the Bureau's overall strategy, these offices and initiatives support partner countries in preventing and managing major health challenges of poor, underserved and vulnerable people, leading to improved health outcomes by:</p>
<p>&bull; Providing technical leadership to USG programs<br />&bull; Partnering strategically with a wide array of stakeholders that enhance the development process<br />&bull; Accelerating innovation, science and technology in order to facilitate a successful treatment and prevention of disease<br />&bull; Scaling up evidence-based, equitable and locally adapted health solutions<br />&bull; Strengthening local health systems<br />&bull; Promoting gender equality<br />&bull; Working efficiently and being effective stewards of public trust and resources</p>
<p>The Global Health Initiative<br />The U.S. Government's global health portfolio includes a diverse set of programs and investments in approximately 80 countries worldwide. All of the countries in which the USG has health investments are essential partners for achieving and sustaining the ambitious outcomes outlined in the Global Health Initiative (GHI). Equally important to the success of GHI is the strategic coordination and partnerships with USG partner organizations such as the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (S/GAC, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Health Resources and Service Administration, the Department of Defense and the Peace Corps. The interagency coordination required to support PEPFAR and PMI increases the effectiveness and efficiency of USG health programs globally by using a "whole of government approach."</p>
<p>Supply chain management and the procurement of essential health commodities are an essential component of the Agency's health portfolio and directly support the Agency's health contribution to GHI. For example, ensuring an adequate supply of quality medicines and diagnostic equipment for HIV programs has contributed significantly to PEPFAR's ability to provide care and treatment for 4.5 million persons living with HIV/AIDS. Maintaining an adequate supply of quality essential medicines is critical to achieving President Obama's goal of putting six million people on treatment by the end 2015 - two million more people than the Administration's original goal.</p>
<p>Essential good quality health commodities have played a critical role toward achieving PMI's goal to halve the burden of malaria in 70 percent of at-risk populations in sub-Saharan Africa (approximately 450 million people). Between 2006 and 2010, PMI procured 95.3 million artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) treatments, 45.4 million insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and 10.2 million treatments for intermittent preventative treatment for malaria in pregnancy. This has contributed to the reductions in mortality among children under five in most of PMI's focus countries. Ensuring an adequate supply of malaria related commodities will continue to be a key component of PMI's continued efforts to further reduce the burden malaria.</p>
<p>USAID has been a leader in efforts to meet the reproductive health needs of women and couples by increasing access to modern methods of contraception for millions of couples annually. While access to family planning services has improved dramatically since USAID's efforts began in the 1960s, more than 215 million women worldwide who would like to delay or avoid pregnancy still do not have access to family planning information and services. Under GHI, the USG goal is to prevent 54 million unintended pregnancies and increase the modern contraceptive prevalence by up to two percentage points annually on average across assisted countries. The Agency is placing special attention on increasing access to family planning services for the poorest wealth quintiles, where access remains lowest. Because USAID's programs maximize access to voluntary family planning products and services, more couples and individuals in the developing world have been able to determine the spacing of their children and family size. Investments in contraceptive commodity support and strengthening logistics systems have reduced stock outs and increased availability of contraceptives in key countries. Between 2006 and 2010, USAID delivered $376.4 million worth of contraceptives and condoms to public and private sector programs worldwide, while providing supply chain assistance in 33 countries. These efforts have contributed to substantial increases in the percentage of women using modern contraceptives in USAID priority countries and have translated to improved maternal and child health, family well-being, women's empowerment, poverty reduction and elevated development prospects.</p>
<p>Current Health Awards<br />Currently, the Bureau for Global Health has two single award IQCs responsible for the procurement and delivery of essential health commodities and supply chain assistance. The first is the USAID | DELIVER PROJECT that focuses its support largely on the PMI and programs in family planning/reproductive health, maternal and child health, emerging pandemic threats, and other areas. The second is the Supply Chain Management System for HIV/AIDS (SCMS) IQC that supports the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). More information on the current IQCs can be found on www.pfscm.org and www.deliver.jsi.com.</p>
<p>New Award Design</p>
<p>The consolidation of the procurement and assistance elements of the DELIVER and SCMS IQCs into a single award will ensure an uninterrupted supply of essential USAID-donated health commodities, align USAID's health commodity requirements across the priority health elements, reduce costs to the U.S. Government, improve management and accountability and ensure implementation flexibilities to respond to unpredictable global demands for USAID essential health commodities and assistance. In addition to this single award, USAID's Bureau for Global Health anticipates the release of several new awards to provide specialized services that are presently embedded in the DELIVER and SCMS IQCs.</p>
<p>The new architecture will realign activities to achieve the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Maintaining continuity of operations to ensure no interruption of supplies; <br />&bull; Ensuring technical and program soundness through a collaborative process; <br />&bull; Ensuring flexibility to meet different program (health element) requirements as well as future needs; <br />&bull; Minimizing management burden for the field; <br />&bull; Promoting risk mitigation by collaborative strategies in quantification/forecasting, market dynamics, and freight forwarding/warehousing and delivery;<br />&bull; Incorporating the principles of GHI, USAID Forward and Procurement Reform; and<br />&bull; Maintaining program oversight and accountability by the different health elements as needed to meet disease specific requirements.</p>
<p>All awards will be made on a full and open competitive basis, except the laboratory procurement IQC that is set aside for small business concerns. The architecture for the supply chain follow-on includes the following awards:</p>
<p>A. Single Award IQC for Commodity Procurement and Supply Chain Assistance: This activity will provide a comprehensive array of services for USG health commodity procurement and related supply chain assistance encompassing the different elements of a comprehensive supply chain (e.g. quantification/forecasting, procurement, transportation, warehousing, and information systems). The IQC holder will be expected to manage the full range of supply chain services - from quantification, procurement, and warehousing to delivery of product to the USG-designated client. The successful implementation of these services depends upon the IQC holder's ability to minimize lead time for field programs while maximizing overall value-for-money performance on delivery of quality essential health commodities. The tasks of this IQC are integrally related and implemented through a single award to optimize overall performance and accountability of what, by best practice, should be a continuous, seamless, operational supply chain. The IQC will work with USG country programs to improve country counterpart systems and increase their capacity to more fully conduct this procurement and distribution work on their own. The IQC is anticipated to supply an estimated $7 billion worth of essential health commodities annually at no fee to over 50 countries; and to provide technical assistance to improve the performance and sustainability of country supply chain systems. The duration of the IQC is anticipated to be 5 years with an option for an additional 3 year period.</p>
<p>The IQC contractor is expected to work with the Quality Assurance holder (see D below) to ensure that the quality of products purchased meets USG standards. In addition, the IQC holder will provide a required set of data to the Business Intelligence (BI) contractor (see E below).</p>
<p>B. Small Business Set Aside - Single award IQC for a Procurement Service Agent for Laboratory Supplies and Equipment: The IQC will have the responsibility for the procurement and shipment of laboratory supplies and equipment to designated destinations/stakeholders for use in host country programs. The duration of this IQC is anticipated to be 5 years with an option for an additional 3 year period.</p>
<p>C. Multiple Awards for Specialized Supply Chain Assistance: These awards are anticipated to be made through annual program statements (APS) to invite and encourage organizations with specialized capabilities. One APS will seek capabilities for research, innovation and evaluation, and access to the state-of-the-art in supply chain management from academia as well as the private, commercial, and other sectors. Another possible APS will be for organizations in the "global south" with demonstrated capabilities in supply chain management, assistance, and/or training, to support local capacity building, and provide for south-to-south assistance and access to regional specializations. Other awards may be made in areas of specialization (e.g., management information system, information technologies) if there is sufficient demand from field.</p>
<p>D. Quality Assurance Award: The Quality Assurance (QA) award will promote the effectiveness and efficiency of USAID QA services by combining and coordinating QA activities across health elements. This activity will provide independent, essential, comprehensive quality assurance/control services covering the different health elements in the Bureau.</p>
<p>E. Business Intelligence Award: The Business Intelligence (BI) award is expected to collect and integrate data from multiple partner systems and generate reports and alerts based on established thresholds. By embedding BI into existing process applications, USAID's control, management, and ownership of information will be enhanced to facilitate information sharing and coordination across health elements within the Bureau's supply chain.</p>
<p>Please note that to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest, offerors bidding as primes for award A (Single Award IQC for Commodity Procurement and Supply Chain Assistance) and/or award B (small business set-aside for Laboratory Equipment and Supplies) will not be permitted to bid as primes on award D (Quality Assurance) and vice versa. This is done to ensure the independence of those responsible for ensuring the safety and efficacy of the products being purchased from those responsible for procurement of product. In addition all awardees are expected to collaborate with one another and will be required to provide non-proprietary data to the Agency using the IT platform developed and maintained by the BI contractor.</p>
<p>USAID bears no responsibility for data errors resulting from this transmission. This notice does not obligate USAID to release a solicitation or award a contract nor does it commit the Government to pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of a proposal.</p>

This notice represents award of a modification to the existing contractor National Government Services, Inc. under contract number HHSM-500-2012-M0013Z in the amount of $500,993 authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS.<br /><br />The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology. Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals.<br />The work to be performed is aligned within the core scope of duties; however, the contractor is being directed to perform additional work. MACs shall enter data into the HITECH Fiscal Intermediary Standard System (FISS) screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals. This data shall be obtained from the latest filed 12 month cost report. As later cost reports are accepted, MACs shall update the data in FISS within five business days of acceptance of the cost report (for those hospitals that have not yet attested and received their initial payment). In addition, MACs shall review and determine an allowable amount for critical access hospital incentive payments, once submitted by the hospital. MACs shall complete its review and enter the allowable amount in FISS within 30 days of receipt of the documentation. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 16.8pt; margin: 0in 0in 15pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 8.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</span></p>

<DESC>NON COMPETITIVE MEMORANDUM<br />FOR ACTIONS UNDER THE SAT<br />IAW FAR 13.106-3(b)(i) AND AFFARS 5313.106-1(b)(3)
<p>1. REQUIRING AGENCY - AFTC/PZIOAC, Eglin AFB, Florida</p>
<p>2. NATURE/DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED - Sole source acquisition of Medtronic Endurant Endografts</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS -Eglin AFB 96th MDG requires these endografts in order to perform surgery on a patient, who was suffering from blockage to their aortic artery.</p>
<p>4. IDENTIFICATION OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION - 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(2)</p>
<p>5. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED:</p>
<p>Currently Medtronic Endurant Endografts are the only product on the market that has the safety mechanism of a Reliant Balloon that allows the surgeon to partially deploy the graft. This safety mechanism differs from its competitors because it gives the surgeon the freedom to realign and/or move the graft safely to the appropriate area of concern without fully deploying the graft. The competitors do not provide this safety option of placement, once deployed there is no way to correct or better place the graft.</p>
<p>6. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS PRACTICABLE:</p>
<p>This requirement was exempt from being synopsized under FAR 5.202(a)(2).</p>
<p>7. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE:</p>
<p>In determining the price to be fair and reasonable, a comparison of price for the Endurant Endografts was made with previous purchases by the Department of Defense Agencies.</p>
<p>Contract # Location Contractor Total Cost<br />FA2823-13-P-XXXX Eglin AFB Medtronic, Inc. $30,740.00<br />FA3047-08-P-XXXX Lackland AFB Medtronic, Inc. $29,025.00<br />N00168-13-P-XXXX Walter Reed Medtronic, Inc. $34,700.00</p>
<p>The total cost of the endovascular repair is $30,740.00 made by Medtronic Inc., therefore the proposed price to the government is considered fair and reasonable with (IAW) FAR 13.106-3(a)(2)(ii)and(vii).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. A DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS</p>
<p>After searching FPDS-NG and EDA for this requirement it was identify that only company Medtronic Inc. can supply the items required. Currently Medtronic is the only company that is FDA approved to manufacture a 1 centimeter neck requiring less graft area. Appropriate graft size is absolutely critical to the success of a procedure of this magnitude. The surgeon decides on the size needed based on the patient's anatomy and size of the aneurism. If the size is off by the smallest measurement, a severe rupture or hemorrhage may occur possibly causing death.</p>
<p>9. ANY OTHER FACT SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:</p>
<p>This requirement was a mission impact; a patient had been suffering from a blockage to his aortic artery and was in need of urgent aortagram to observe the extent of the injury. By providing the Medtronic Endurant Endografts secured the care for the patient under unexpected yet possible trauma care and helped prevent any loss of limbs or embolisms. The requirement helped restore blood circulation to the patient's legs giving him a better chance of a successful treatment and a speedy recovery.</p>
<p><br />10. A LIST OF SOURCES THAT EXPRESSED IN WRITING AN INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION: <br /><br />None</p>
<p>11. ACTIONS TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS:</p>
<p>This was an unfortunate situation and there are no known actions actions to prevent a recurrence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I certify that the facts contained in this justification are complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge.</p>
