<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Because of space restrictions the cabinet can be no deeper than 30. As there is to be network connect ivity on the first and second floor the location of the cabinet 's location was chosen for the following functional reasons: 1 this communications room is air conditioned to keep networking equipment cool and is relatively dust free; 2 This location is the  ideal spot to take advantage of the communications pathways. The data cabling distribution will be housed inside the cabinet. 4.2 Grounding The communications cabinet will be properly grounded. All grounding will be done in accordance with  Ansi Tia Eia 6 07. 4.3 Power Requirement At the proposed location there is an existing  duplex 120 volt outlet.

This EMT installation is not only undersized but also there are not enough of them.  The room heights are around 8-10 high and are open spaced. The hallways are also 8-10 high and have an existing false ceiling th at is 5-0 high from the structural roof throughout this facility.  Within this 3 ft. Space EMT for telephone and electric, Air conditioning ducts are run to service the rooms.      All of the interior walls are drywall with a wood textured paneling. 4.4.2 Primary Facility Pathway Description 4.4.2.1 Pathway The proposed cabinet location was chosen because it sits directly in the middle.  To distribute the cable throughout the building cable J-Hooks will be installed throughout the hallways inside of the fal se ceiling.   The pathway for the rooms will be surface mounted raceway.  At no time will the cable in the raceway exceed 40% fill.  When installing the raceway from above the false ceiling line to the outlet height the raceway will not come down in the mi ddle of any wall, the corners will be utilized. 4.5 Cabling The type of cabling throughout the building will be 4 pair Category 6 plenum rated cabling. There will be 20 outlets throughout the facility.  Each outlet will be a dual data outlet with 2 cables terminated 568A cabling scheme 182 cable runs total.
