<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement to increase the Estimated Contract Value of theTechnical Services for Aerospace Systems Modeling and Simulation contract. A modificationreflecting this increase, which applies to all periods of the contract, will be issuedfor the period not to exceed June 30, 2015. NASA/ARC intends to increase the estimated contract value of the SimLab contract, whichwas awarded through full and open competition, to Science Applications InternationalCorporation (SAIC) in June of 2005. This increase is required due to unexpectedSimulation Facilities repairs/upgrades as well as an increase in simulation projects.NASA is using the authority of other than full and open competition, 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1). Justification is based on SAICs unique expertise of the current upgrades andthe simulations in progress as well as their ability to provide continuity of servicethrough the end of the current contract. Award to another source during the same periodof performance would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that isnot expected to be recovered through competition, and unacceptable delays in fulfillingthe agency's requirement. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 2:00 p.m. local timeon June 18, 2008. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All questions MUST bein writing and should be directed to Ms. Naomi Castillo-Velasquez not later than 2:30p.m. local time on June 12, 2008. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA ARC has a requirement for a solar simulator to measure conversion efficienciesof photons to electrical power, which is vital to developing solar cell devices. Thesolar simulator must have a variable illumination area that can provide uniformillumination up to an area of 12x12. It is preferable that the 12x12 area isilluminated with collimated light; however, a square area of at least 4x4 must becollimated. The solar simulator must come with a wide range of integrated filters tosimulate incident solar light conditions covering the entire solar spectrum rangeincluding the UV, Vis, and IR with and without the presence of an atmosphere. The solarsimulator must adequately simulate the solar spectrum with power densities that rangeswithin +/- one decade of one sun (i.e. within the range of 0.1 to 10 suns). It will alsobe necessary in the future to have the option of carrying out measurements as a functionof incident angle with respect to the perpendicular direction of surface plane. As such,it will be necessary to have an integrated PV-IV electrical testing instrumentationaccompanying the solar simulator that also allows for flexibility with upgrades insoftware and hardware for future add-ons. The solar simulator must include all of thenecessary and compatible power supplies, testing instruments, cables, manuals, and anyother relevant hardware and software integration tools needed to make the solar simulatora single turn-key system that will be ready to use out of the box upon receipt formeasuring the electrical conversion efficiencies of photons to electrical output power.NASA ARC intends to purchase this item from Newport Corporation, Irvine CA, that is theonly known responsible source for a solar simulator that meets all of the aboverequirements.  The authority of this action is 10 USC 2304(c)(1). The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and the procurementwill be conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures set forth under FAR Part 13. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort via email to the identified point of contact no later than 12:00 p.m. (Noon) PSTon June 19, 2008. Please note that this is a hard deadline and that no late responseswill be accepted.

<DESC><p>NIOSH is the federal agency responsible for conducting research and making recommendations for the prevention of work-related injury and illness. Under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, as amended by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, NIOSH administers a long-standing chest radiographic monitoring program for underground coal miners. In this, as in other health surveillance programs, conventional screen-film chest radiographic imaging has been an indispensable and important tool for monitoring the lung health of miners and other dust-exposed workers. In these programs, trained readers assess a worker's chest radiograph for the presence and severity of lung parenchymal opacities and pleural changes, using a classification system developed by the International Labour Office (ILO). The ILO classification system was designed to systematically record the changes seen on standard screen-film chest radiographs as a result of dust inhalation, and requires the reader to compare any abnormalities observed on the worker's radiograph to a set of standard radiographs exemplifying dust diseases, provided as hard copy films by the ILO. NIOSH is also involved in the training and certification of expert readers experienced in the ILO system through the B Reader program. NIOSH has long experience with the B Reader program and with research and monitoring activities using radiographic assessments and continues to have an extensive impact on national and international practices in workforce medical screening, research, hazard evaluations, clinical practice, compensation, and standard setting in occupational disease.
<p>Increasingly, medical imaging and patient information systems are utilizing digital approaches to data acquisition, transmission, storage, display, and interpretation. Over the next decade, conventional radiography will be completely replaced by digital radiography systems in the United States. Thus, it is essential for NIOSH to adopt and enable the application of digital systems in the recognition of occupational lung disorders within its own research and monitoring programs, as well as to be able to recommend and advise on the use of digital technology in the identification and assessment of occupational lung disease both nationally and internationally.</p>
<p>This solicitation will provide NIOSH with expert support and guidance in the purchase, installation, and implementation of hardware and software systems to allow transition of the NIOSH radiographic program to digital radiography. Equipment, software, and changes to current practices and guidelines will be needed for image acquisition, receiving, storing, and soft copy display; disseminating images to B readers; soft copy display and interpretation of images by B readers; receiving classifications in electronic format from B readers; generating reports; and long-term information management, including storage of images, participant questionnaire information, and reports; and accessing information for generation of summary statistics. This effort will enable and facilitate the use of digital images for all current and future NIOSH occupational lung disease radiographic screening, surveillance, research, and service activities.<br />.</p>
<p>This requirement is being solicited as Full and Open Competition.</p>
<p>The CDC expects to award a single cost reimbursement plus fixed fee type contract, and the period of performance is expected to be approximately 18 months from date of award.</p>
<p>The complete solicitation document, and reference material, if applicable, will be available for downloading at www.fedbizopps.gov on or about 6/20/2008 and proposals will be due on or about 7/21/2008. No verbal or written requests for copies will be accepted.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of perspective offerors to stay abreast of additional postings regarding this solicitation at the FedBizOpps internet site.</p>
<p>No government-wide notes apply.</p>

<DESC>The Division of Select Agents and Toxins (DSAT) in the Coordinating Office for Terrorism Prevention and Emergency Response (COTPER) in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), intends to compete a requirement for laboratory support services for the Select Agent Programs to furnish educated, qualified, and trained personnel to provide technical and program support in select agent and import permit activities including support of laboratory inspection activities, records, management and control, data entry, regulatory support, and file management. It is anticipated that one contract will be awarded for a one-year base period plus four one-year option periods.
Public Law 107-188, The ?Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002,? requires that the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) in cooperation with the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), establish and enforce procedures for possession, use, and transfer of select agents.  Select agents are biological agents and toxins that are regulated under 42 CFR Part 73 that pose a severe threat to public health and safety.   The select agent regulations, 42 CFR Part 73, established requirements for facilities that possess, use, and transfer select agents. 

Currently, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Select Agents and Toxins (DSAT) has been delegated by the Secretary of HHS to ensure compliance with the select agent regulations.  These regulations are implemented so that the select agents are available for legitimate research purposes, but inaccessible to potential terrorists.    To ensure compliance, CDC must inspect and evaluate entities using the requirements outlined in the select agent regulations and known biosafety standards such as the CDC/NIH (National Institutes of Health) publication, "Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories" (BMBL), 29 CFR 1910.1450, ?Occupational Exposure to Hazardous Chemicals in Laboratories,? and the ?NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules.? 

The Public Health Service Foreign Quarantine Regulations (42 CFR, Section 71.54) govern the importation of etiological agents, hosts, and vectors of human disease into the United States.  A person may not import into the United States, nor distribute after importation, any etiologic agent or any arthropod or other animal host or vector of human disease, or any exotic living arthropod or other animal capable of being a host or vector of human disease unless accompanied by a permit issued by the Director of CDC. 

The CDC Etiologic Agent Import Permit Program (EAIPP) located within the Division of Select Agents and Toxins is responsible for the issuing CDC import permits.  Information is submitted to EAIPP, as required by the provisions of 42 CFR 71.54, for issuance of permits by CDC to importers or distributors after importation of etiologic agents, hosts, or vectors of human disease.  To carry out this provision, EAIPP has developed two forms for application for a permit.  One form, the ?Application for Permit to Import or Transport Etiologic Agents, hosts, or Vectors of Human Disease? is used to request permits for the importation and subsequent distribution after importation of etiologic agents, hosts, or vectors of human disease.  The second form, the ?Application for Permit to Import or Transport Live Bats? is used to request importation and subsequent distribution after importation of live bats. Issuance of the CDC import permit is essential in protecting the public?s health by monitoring the importation of etiologic agents. 

Etiologic agents are those microorganisms that cause disease in humans and include bacteria, bacterial toxins, viruses, fungi, rickettsia, protozoans, and parasites. These disease-causing microorganisms may also be referred to as infectious agents. Infectious substances and biological materials, such as body fluids and tissues that contain them, are referred to as infectious materials. Organisms such as mosquitoes, ticks, or snails, that may transmit infectious diseases to animals, including humans, are called vectors.
 
Responses by Facsimile (Fax) will not be accepted. All vendors/prospective contractors must be registered with the Central Contractors Registration (www.ccr.gov) prior to award date. If not registered or active by that date, vendor proposals will be considered non-responsive.  It is anticipated that a solicitation for this requirement will be posted to FedBizopps on or after 2/26/2008.

Inquiries may be sent to the attention of the Contract Specialist: Kristopher Lemaster, Phone 770-488-2995, email Klemaster@cdc.gov.  If the Contract Specialist isn?t available, please call the Team Leader, Vivian Hubbs.

<DESC>Section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) requires the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to take the necessary steps between now and 2011 to implement Medicare Contracting Reform (MCR).     MCR will bring standard contracting principles to Medicare such as competition and performance incentives.  These basic contracting principles which have been applied to other federal programs under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) have been missing from the Medicare Contracting environment. CMS is required to replace the current contracting authority under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act with the new Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) authority.  The law directs CMS to conduct full and open competitions for new MACs, that will perform the work currently being handled by fiscal intermediaries, carriers, regional home health intermediaries, and durable medical equipment regional carriers in administering the Medicare fee-for-service program. As such, CMS anticipates conducting a full and open competition for the Part A and Part B Medicare Administrative Contractors (A/B MAC).
The A/B MAC will provide specified fee-for-service health insurance benefit administration services, including Medicare claims processing and payment services, for most all institutional health care as well as for providers. In addition to the core A/B MAC workload, CMS anticipates including optional services to be performed. Optional services include functions related to Graduate Medical Demonstration and the Rural Community Hospital Demonstration. It is anticipated that this competition will result in award of one, stand-alone A/B MAC contract.     This contract will include a base year and four, one-year options.  Any questions should be directed to Ms. Melinda (Miki) Lewis, Contract Specialist, at (410) 786-5461, or by sending e-mail to Melinda.Lewis@cms.hhs.gov. E-mail communications should include company name and size (Large/Small), address, point of contact, phone and fax numbers. Any additional information and documents on this requirement will be posted to FedBizOpps.  CMS anticipates release of the Request for Proposal (RFP) by mid September 2005.

<DESC>The Department of the Treasury Office of Technical Assistance is recruiting individuals on a competitive basis to serve as resident and/or intermittent (short-term) advisors, under personal services contracts, for its Banking and Financial Services Program.  This recruitment is for global assignments and significant international travel is required.  

The Banking and Financial Services Program is charged with promoting commercial banking sector development that efficiently intermediates between savers and investors.  To achieve this, the program works with central banks, ministries of finance, banking regulatory and supervision agencies, deposit insurance agencies, banking associations, and other banking related entities in countries with emerging or transition economies.  It also provides technical assistance to countries that have developed economies but are experiencing difficulties in their banking sectors.

QUALIFICATIONS: Treasury is seeking candidates who possess expertise in banking and bank regulation with specific experience in the restructuring and privatization of banks; banking sector development, asset management and disposition; banking supervision (on-site and off-site); deposit guaranty systems; central bank operations; monetary policy; credit analysis; lending; bank liquidations; and other facets of banking sector activity.  A working knowledge of French, Spanish, or Arabic will be a plus in relevant countries.  Ideal candidates would have experience with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve, Resolution Trust Corporation, international financial institutions, and/or commercial banks.  Prior overseas experience working in challenging environments would be a distinct advantage but is not mandatory.  While technical skills are essential, the ability to gain the confidence of officials in host countries is also very important.
 
Candidates must be U.S. citizens or U.S. resident aliens.

SALARY AND BENEFITS: Salaries will be negotiated in accordance with program regulations based on demonstrated salary history. Expected compensation currently ranges from $115,317 to $158,500.  Overseas benefits are provided as allowed by federal regulations.  Successful applicants will be subject to a background investigation at the appropriate level.

Please reference Solicitation Number A08-049 on your resume or OF-612.  Only applicants to be interviewed will be contacted.  No Phone calls please.

<DESC>Intent to Award Brand Name Evo Tech Endoscope Cleaner and Reprocessor   

10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy Colorado, intends to award a brand name only commercial purchase order in accordance with FAR Parts 12 & 13. This notice document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-14, 22 Nov 06. The North America Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 423450 and the size standard is 500 employees. The requirement is to purchase: 1 each Product number 100012-01 Evo Tech GI Suite (1 each 50004,20398, 22591, 20302, 13004001), 1 each Part Number 09003104 CH SEP, OLY>=40 series, 1 each Part Number 09601103 SCOPE CON SET, OLY GI>=40.  These items will require identification adhering to DFARS 252.211-7003 (http://farsite.hill.af.mil).  The justification for the brand name requirement is as follows:

a. This ECR is the only system with FDA clearance to automate manual cleaning.  The Evo Tech Systems 33 minute cycle time includes the normally labor-intensive manual cleaning of the scope, which takes 6-10 minutes per scope.  Additionally, this system automatically detects leaks thereby eliminatiing the inconsistencies associated with manual inspection.    

b.  The Evo Tech ECR System has a large basin size (21 inches) this helps to prevent endoscope coiling, there potentially reducing endoscope repair costs.

<DESC>This presolicitation notice is for the acquisition of commercial items in accordance with FAR Subpart 12 inconjunction with FAR Subpart 13.106-2, Evaluation of Offerors.  

The solicitation number is HSFEGC-08-R-0023 and is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 05-17. 

The Center for Disease Control (CDC) has tested the FEMA trailers and found that there is a possibility of dangerous levels of Formaldehyde inside of the FEMA trailers.  Due to these tests, FEMA has decided to relocate as expeditiously as possible the remaining citizens who are still occupying FEMA trailers.  Part of accomplishing this task is providing for supplemental food assistance for households that do not have access to kitchen facilities while in interim housing, and that can show a need for assistance.

The goal of the SOW is to provide the necessary supplemental food assistance needed by eligible applicants placed in interim lodging that lacks kitchen facilities.  The intention is to provide renewable food vouchers for the purchase of food. 

The Contractor shall:
Provide the necessary services to satisfy the requirements defined in the SOW.  The Government is seeking commercial services that industry normally accords to customers at competitive prices. 

Be capable of providing services for ordering agencies with multiple organizational levels and geographic locations nationwide.

Be capable of handling multiple task orders simultaneously. 

The NAICS code for this acquisition is 722310 with a size standard of $19 million in assets. 

FEMA intends to award this contract by issuing task orders against an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract.  This acquisition is a total small business set-aside for the region affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita (Mississippi and Louisiana). FEMA reserves the right to issue contracts/task orders to multiple vendors across the Gulf Coast region.

It is expected that contracts awarded will be for one base year ending on or about 28 February 2009 with four (4) one-year options.  The period of performance for service CLINs contained in the contracts will vary based on the type of service provided and will be prescribed in individual task orders issued under each specific contract.

The locations where applicants are currently concentrated include the metropolitan areas of: New Orleans, Louisiana; Lake Charles, Louisiana; Biloxi, Mississippi; Jackson, Mississippi; but services may be needed elsewhere in the continental U.S.

All reasonable attempts will be made to acquire services from local contractors in accordance with the Stafford Disaster Relief Act as amended. If this is not feasible, the competition may be first increased to statewide and, if necessary, then nationwide.

These contracts provide patent-related services including patent searches, patent prosecution, infringement and interference services and licensing consultation to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Technology Transfer (OTT).  This sole source is to prevent a lapse in service for roughly a six month period (estimated July, 26 2008 through January 25, 2009) during negotiation and award of multiple contracts under RFP# 263-2006-P(GM)-0247 for Patent Legal Services which was posted to www.fbo.gov on March 2, 2007.  This action is under the authority 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 as it is impracticable to seek competition for the roughly six month period while negotiations under RFP #263-2006-P(GM)-0247 are ongoing.  Only the current contractors are uniquely qualified  to perform the services required within the six month period.  Based on the complexity and level of detail involved in dealing with these cases, it is not feasible for new contractors to assume responsibility for the patent case load for such a brief period of time and meet the deadlines necessary for filing with the USPTO and foreign entities. The OTT active patent prosecution docket is in excess of 1,300 cases and the OTT issues thousands of task orders for these cases that are in various stages of the patent application process or prosecution.  The transfer of cases to new vendors will take a minimum of one month and then, in all likelihood, will have to be transferred just a few weeks after to new contractors receiving awards under RFP 263-2006-P(GM)-0247. For example, the transfer of files could take between six weeks to three months, providing a new bridge acquisition vendor only a few weeks to handle work before transferring cases to the awardees under RFP 263-2006-P(GM)-0247 if the second transfer of files is less than three months.  Between the time for transfer of cases, the vendors would not be able to go through the conflict of interest process, proceed with the docketing procedures in an efficient manner to determine the prosecution stage, get up to speed on billing procedures, inventors and new technology as well as review the entire family of applications and determine which of the key personnel in the firm is best to handle the work.  This process is time consuming and must take place before actual work can begin.  RFP 263-2006-P(GM)-0247 has an orientation required on site at OTT for all awardees.  It is not possible for the government to provide an extensive orientation for new vendors during this bridge acquisition period. Interruption of service would result in significant harm to the U.S. Government in the loss of intellectual property rights in the United States and foreign countries in connection with multiple patent cases.  This is not a solicitation for competitive proposals.  However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing, and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the Government to determine if the party can meet all of the requirements of the Statement of Work and the terms and conditions of the current bridge contracts. Capability statements and related materials must be received by the Contract Specialist no later than July 21, 2008, at 10:00 AM Eastern Time. Written responses received after July 21, 2008, 10:00 AM Eastern Time will not be accepted. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Address responses to the attention of Erin Flynn at the National Institutes of Health, Office of Acquisitions via email at flynne1@od.nih.gov.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC)/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) currently has two leases in Key Largo, FL, one for office space and one is for dock space. The distance from the office and dock space is approximately six miles. Functionally, the area of interest for a combined office and vessel facility would be between Garden Cove in the north and Tavernier Creek in the south. Maintaining the current condition of separate office and dock facilities requires the minimum distance between the office and dock facility short as possible to minimize operational costs experienced by staff (experienced as primarily as costly transit time to and from these facilities by staff) and maximize the administrative and operational efficiency of the operation. Continuation of the current dual lease approach is an acceptable approach but is a less desirable situation. Closer geographic association of these facilities, including a combined office and vessel facility lease is desirable and will be considered in the current analysis. The Government is interested in considering alternative space if economically advantageous. <br />OFFICE Minimum Space Requirements are as follows:<br />Approximately 4,676 square feet of office space, 3,317 square feet of storage space and 10,000 square feet of outside fenced storage area.<br />DOCK Space requirements are as follows:<br />Approximately 270 Linear feet of dock space that can accommodate larger boats. Requires Oceanside access, centrally located, gas and diesel fuel onsite, parking, yard storage. Be able to storage between 5 and 7 boats at any given time. Must have a controlling depth of 5 feet and must have direct access to the Straits of Florida and Atlantic Ocean. Upland parking for up to 12 vehicles.<br />The delineated area, for this requirement is it must be centrally located within a fifteen radius of mile marker 95 on Overseas Highway in Key Largo, FL.<br />Alternative Actions - Continue to operate under a split site condition, in which the office would be within 10 miles from the dock operations.<br />Office space must meet the requirements outlined above for split operation. Must be located between mile marker 110 and mile marker 80 on Overseas Highway in the Florida Keys. The space must be fully serviced, fully accessible in accordance with ADA standards and must conform to applicable Life Safety Performance Level. All locations will be inspected by the Government to ensure they meet the requirements before they receive further consideration.<br />Dock space must meet the above requirements for combined operation. Centrally located, on the ocean access for larger boats with the reference upland support amenities. <br />The Government will consider the cost of moving, alterations, etc., when deciding whether it should relocate.<br />If the proposal is a build to suit, provide the location of property to be used for new construction and evidence that the property is under your control. Proposal submitted by brokers/agents must be accompanied by written evidence they are authorized to represent the ownership. Persons interested in offering office and dock space that could meet these requirements should submit your locations for consideration, please forward information by July 15, 2008 to following: Rosa Asberry, Contracting Officer, U.S. Department of Commerce/NOAA, 601 E. 12th Street&nbsp; Room 1736, Kansas City, MO 64106.

For any questions concerning this notice, contact Dori Walsh 215-697-6560.
The subject items requires Government source approval prior to contract award,  as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not  been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.  Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items has been solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the "http://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.cfm" U.S. Navy Aviation Supply Office Source Approval Information Brochure.  This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in repair of the same or similar items. This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVICP-P at (215) 697-4243.  If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval.  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SUBJECT>Assay Development to detect viruses
<SOLNBR>AG-6395-S-08-0083
<RESPDATE>061808
<CONTACT>Nathan Johnson, Email nathan.d.johnson@aphis.usda.gov
<DESC>If you are capable of conducting the below research and development please send a statement of capabilities to Nathan Johnson (Nathan.d.johnson@aphis.usda.gov).  This statement should include past performance or some other measureable criteria to establish that your firm is capable of accomplishing this work.  The responses received from this sources sought notice will assist in determining the type of competition for this acquisition.  All companies are encouraged to reply.

The overall objective is for the contractor to work with the United States Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA  APHIS) to develop a sensitive, specific assay capable of detecting all Avian Influenza viruses in a mixed sample, including known and unknown strains (i.e., virus drift that would be flagged for follow-up).  Once a technology is established for detecting Avian Influenza other viruses (e.g., Foot and Mouth Disease) will be added.

The Technology should be capable of:
Detection of many types of infectious micro-organisms* with a single platform; 
detection of a wide range of infectious micro-organisms (e.g., entire virus genus or family) from any host species with a limited set of reagents - information leading to reagent design may be provided by user or public domain; 

Identification of known, unknown, deliberately altered, divergent, or mutated agents within the 'wide range of agents' cited above; 

Detection of multiple microorganisms simultaneously in a mixed sample (prefer clinical sample); 

Reliable, sensitive, specific, high-throughput (100s-1000/day, with automation if necessary) sample assays in 12 hours or less;

Routinely operable by technician (e.g., BS level) with results able to interpretation by PhD level.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  This notice is for information and planning purposes only.  This is not a request for proposals and does not commit the government to award a contract; therefore, no solicitation is available at this time.  This requirement has classified aspects, and a DD Form 254 - Contract Security Classification Specification, will be attached to the anticipated solicitation and any resultant contract.
The Division of Select Agents and Toxins (DSAT) in the Coordinating Office for Terrorism Prevention and Emergency Response (COTPER) in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), contemplates a contract for laboratory support services for the Select Agent Programs to furnish educated, qualified, and trained personnel to provide technical and program support in select agent and import permit activities including support of laboratory inspection activities, records, management and control, data entry, regulatory support, and file management. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SPECIFIED DD FORM 254 CONTRACT SECURITY CLASSIFICATION SPECIFICATION. Qualified personnel must be able to enter highly classified government locations in order to perform the contract work. Therefore, many of the personnel who work on this requirement will need U.S. government security clearances at the SECRET level.

Public Law 107-188, The ?Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002,? requires that the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) in cooperation with the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), establish and enforce procedures for possession, use, and transfer of select agents.  Select agents are biological agents and toxins that are regulated under 42 CFR Part 73 that pose a severe threat to public health and safety.   The select agent regulations, 42 CFR Part 73, established requirements for facilities that possess, use, and transfer select agents. 

Currently, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Select Agents and Toxins (DSAT) has been delegated by the Secretary of HHS to ensure compliance with the select agent regulations.  These regulations are implemented so that the select agents are available for legitimate research purposes, but inaccessible to potential terrorists.    To ensure compliance, CDC must inspect and evaluate entities using the requirements outlined in the select agent regulations and known biosafety standards such as the CDC/NIH (National Institutes of Health) publication, "Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories" (BMBL), 29 CFR 1910.1450, ?Occupational Exposure to Hazardous Chemicals in Laboratories,? and the ?NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules.? 

The Public Health Service Foreign Quarantine Regulations (42 CFR, Section 71.54) govern the importation of etiological agents, hosts, and vectors of human disease into the United States.  A person may not import into the United States, nor distribute after importation, any etiologic agent or any arthropod or other animal host or vector of human disease, or any exotic living arthropod or other animal capable of being a host or vector of human disease unless accompanied by a permit issued by the Director of CDC. 

The CDC Etiologic Agent Import Permit Program (EAIPP) located within the Division of Select Agents and Toxins is responsible for the issuing CDC import permits.  Information is submitted to EAIPP, as required by the provisions of 42 CFR 71.54, for issuance of permits by CDC to importers or distributors after importation of etiologic agents, hosts, or vectors of human disease.  To carry out this provision, EAIPP has developed two forms for application for a permit.  One form, the ?Application for Permit to Import or Transport Etiologic Agents, hosts, or Vectors of Human Disease? is used to request permits for the importation and subsequent distribution after importation of etiologic agents, hosts, or vectors of human disease.  The second form, the ?Application for Permit to Import or Transport Live Bats? is used to request importation and subsequent distribution after importation of live bats. Issuance of the CDC import permit is essential in protecting the public?s health by monitoring the importation of etiologic agents. 

Etiologic agents are those microorganisms that cause disease in humans and include bacteria, bacterial toxins, viruses, fungi, rickettsia, protozoans, and parasites. These disease-causing microorganisms may also be referred to as infectious agents. Infectious substances and biological materials, such as body fluids and tissues that contain them, are referred to as infectious materials. Organisms such as mosquitoes, ticks, or snails, that may transmit infectious diseases to animals, including humans, are called vectors.

Interested offerors are requested to submit capability statements, including your organization?s technical qualifications to perform this work and your organization?s business size status based on the specified NAICS code ? 541690.  Please submit your response to Kristopher Lemaster, Centers for Disease Control, Procurement and Grants Office, via email at Klemaster@cdc.gov by Feb 29, 2008.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice No. SS-NIH-OD-OA-2008-1


Title:  The Insight into the Determinant of Exceptional Aging and Longevity (IDEAL) Study. 

This Sources Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Institute of Aging (NIA) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).


The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to identify qualified small businesses including 8(a), HUBZone, Women Owned Small business, Small disadvantaged Business, and/or Service-Disabled Veteran-owned business concerns that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein.  The NIA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted.  As a result of this Sources Sought Notice, the NIA may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP). THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NIA shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought Notice or the NIAs use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.  It is anticipated that one (1) cost-reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a period of five (5) years, with an option for yearly extensions up to two (2) additional years and/or additional quantities.  This contract may include incentives, award fees, and/or be performance based. 
 
					
The National Institute of Aging is seeking qualified small businesses including 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran-owned business concerns to provide support to the Longitudinal Studies Section (LSS), Clinical Research Branch (CRB), Intramural Research Branch (IRB), of the National Institutes of Aging (NIA), under the NIH to provide recruiting support as described below:  


The proposed contract is aimed at enrolling 500 new Exceptionally Healthy and Long Lived (IDEAL) participants in the Baltimore Washington Longitudinal Study of Aging over a 5-year period.  It is expected that approximately 50% of individuals who are invited for screening, based on a preliminary questionnaire-based evaluation, will be eligible for the study, and about 50% of them will join the BLSA. Thus, an average of 400 screening visits per year will be required to enroll 100 Elite Aging individuals per year in the BLSA. 


The prevalence of individuals with these characteristics in the population cannot be reliably estimated from existing studies, either because these studies selected subgroups of the population (for example Health ABC or WHAS) or because some of the inclusion criteria described above were not collected.  Based on the few available data, it can be conservatively estimated that approximately 1% of those 80 years or older fit the characteristics for inclusion in the IDEAL study.  The catchment area identified for the identification of the IDEAL cohort is 150 miles around Baltimore.  This is a highly populated area, with more than 8 million people living in the Baltimore Washington area and approximately other 7 million people living in the rest of the large catchments area. Since the percentage of those 80+ in the population is approximately 4.0%, there are approximately 600,000 people in the 80+ category, and it can be estimated that about 6000 of them are Elite (one percent)


Proposals will be sought to recruit, screen, and enroll 500 extremely healthy older individuals from the Washington-Baltimore area for participation in the Baltimore  Washington Longitudinal Study of Aging over a 5 year period. The work to be performed includes implementing an extensive advertising campaign, designing and conducting a screening program, and facilitating enrollment of IDEAL aging individuals into the Baltimore Washington Longitudinal study of Aging, the oldest and most prestigious longitudinal study of aging maintained and sponsored by the NIH, National Institute on Aging.


The Government estimates that approximately 3 staff years are supported by this effort. 


Capability Statements for this requirement shall address the following six (6) areas:


1.  At time of award, the presence of an office is to be near to or in the center of the study area. 


2.  Experience with contracts of a similar size and scope to this proposed project.  
Contract(s)/project(s) listed may include those entered into by the Federal Government, agencies of state or local governments, and commercial concerns.

	 
3.  An approach that demonstrates a clear understanding of the draft SOW.


4.  Proposed personnel demonstrate that your organization has the necessary expertise to perform the requirements of the project.  

For information purposes, it is estimated that about 5,500 direct labor hours of effort will be required on a yearly basis.  


5.  All necessary equipment and instrumentation for all aspects of the contract, including advertisement, recruitment, screening, materials and supplies, travel, software, and creation of a recruitment web site are required.  The Government will not be providing equipment for use on this project; therefore, the contractor shall provide evidence that the equipment and instrumentation identified in this draft SOW shall be accessible and available for immediate use on this project. 


6.  The related experience of the company must address the capability of the organization to meet the above requirements.


7.  Options may or may not apply to this contract.


8.  Incentives may or may not apply to this contract.


Interested qualified small business organizations should submit a capability statement for this requirement not to exceed twenty (20) single sided pages including all attachments, resumes, charts, etc. (single spaced, 12 point font minimum) that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice described above and in the draft SOW.  All proprietary information should be marked as such.  Responses will be reviewed only by NIH personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.  In the event an RFP is issued, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541720 with a size standard of 6.5 Million is being contemplated.


Capability statements are due no later than 2:00 p.m. eastern prevailing time on Thursday June 19, 2008.  Please submit one (1) original and four (4) copies of your response to:  Drake G. Russell, Contract Specialist, Office of Acquisitions, Office of the Director, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland  20892-7540.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY - THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.
The National Park Service Competitive Sourcing Office, is located in the NPS Headquarters Organization, Office of the Assistant Director, Business Services.  Their primary mission is to manage the National Park Service Competitive Sourcing program and implement OMB Circular A-76, (dated 30 September 2005) and the Office of Management and Budget Circular Number A-76 (Revised May 29, 2003). 
Market research is being conducted as part of the competitive phase to determine the private sector cost estimate in accordance with OMB Circular A-76 and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. The purpose of the market research is to determine whether potential sources are available to satisfy agency requirements allowing standard public-private competition and to develop a private sector cost estimate to compete with the NPS.  Small business sources will be considered in this research.  A contract may or may not result depending on the outcome of the market research and any subsequent public-private competition.  
The purpose of conducting a public-private competition is to determine the most efficient and cost effective method for providing the services required. If conducted, a public-private competition will determine whether the services will be performed under contract from a single commercial source or continue to be provided by a Most Efficient Organization (MEO) of the federal workforce.  
Please be advised any commercial source that provides information as part of this market research process that any information provided will be protected.  This information is being collected solely to assist the government in developing the private sector cost estimate.  Information obtained will not be used later as part of the evaluation process should the commercial source choose to submit a proposal to any solicitation that may result. 
Research Method:  A questionnaire has been specifically designed to focus on the scope of requirements of this competition.  Please complete the questionnaire if you have an interest in this requirement.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command is soliciting information from industry to determine potential contractors who have the skills, experience, qualifications, and knowledge required to successfully design, develop, integrate, test, qualify, and produce a low cost replacement Container for the All-Up-Round (AUR) Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW). The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to assess current industry experience, capabilities, and interest in a full and open competition to satisfy the objectives identified herein. NAVAIR intends to use the information provided in response to this RFI to aid in refining its acquisition strategy, budgeting assumptions, statement of work, and performance specification.
This Sources Sought is the first of several future announcements advertising this requirement. NAVAIR plans to issue a separate Sources Sought announcement which will include the Government's draft contract and performance specification. In addition, NAVAIR plans to host an Industry Day meeting. A firm time/date will be announced at a later date.

A competitive performance-based specification solicitation for the JSOW AUR Container effort is anticipated for release in the 3rd quarter of FY08. A Best Value source selection is planned with an anticipated development/qualification contract award in FY09.

The Government's solicitation will require the design, development, integration, test, qualification, and production of a low cost replacement AUR JSOW Container. Additionally, the Government will require the delivery of a Technical Data Package (TDP) and Government Purpose License Rights (GPLR). The Government anticipates this solicitation to result in the award of a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) contract for the qualification/FAT effort and also four (4) FFP production options beginning as early as FY09.

Objectives:  The JSOW Container performance specification and statement of work are currently under development; however, early draft specifications and other related technical and programmatic documentation are available for your review and comment. This program includes information that has been designated as Distribution D and is only releasable to current and approved Department of Defense (DoD) contractors. As such, they will not be posted with the RFP. To obtain a copy of these documents, please contact Mr. John Antol at the email address provided below with the name of your company, mailing address, phone number, email address, and current CAGE number.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Aircrew Endurance Program seeks interested vendors to support production of a new man mounted survival item/body armor carrier. This carrier will be a replacement for the currently fielded survival vest and body armor worn by USN and USMC operators of H-46, H-53, UH-1, H-60, V-22, and AH-1 aircraft. Competitive production contract(s) to a Navy specification may occur in the 2010 timeframe. This notice is to announce an industry day to be held 19 June 2008 so that potential suppliers (more specifically defined below) may be prepared to present webbings, hardware components, harness components, and fabrics that may be incorporated into the manufacturing specification to enhance the capability of the system. The USN intends to present design and integration requirements as well as system design concepts during this Industry Day. Participation in this Industry Day is not mandatory and will not preclude any interested vendors (as defined below) from participation in the subsequent procurement. This notice is intended for component manufacturers, such as weavers/knitters/spinners of fabric, fabric netting, fabric mesh, webbing, tapes, bindings, and/or sewing threads; and formers of textile, metal, plastic, and/or composite fasteners, closures, connectors, adjusters, and pulls. This announcement is NOT intended for vendors or manufacturers of pocketry, flotation, gear carriage vests, hydration, cooling/heating technologies, armor carriers, armor hard plate, fragmentation soft plate, harnesses, webgear, cushion covers, other man-mounted clothing, or any other prime vendors outsourcing to the aforementioned component manufacturers. Specific hardware components sought include but are not limited to: webbing closures, pocket attachment hardware, pocket closures, garment closures, rip-cords, and friction adjusters that can be blind-operated with a wetted, gloved, hand; that will operate in the sandy conditions of the Middle East as well as wet rainy conditions; that are durable in extreme heat and cold, that have a matte finish; that have a 66 lb hardware retention strength, are snag resistant; that exhibit salt-fog corrosion resistance, high heat resistance, flame resistance; are lightweight, low bulk, consistent multiple use, easily replaceable, and that have no parts or components that can accidentally detach or shed under rotor wash, high wind, or light impact. Specific fabrics and tapes/ webbings sought include but are not limited to those appropriate for load-carrying (e.g., 7-lb hard armor plate, 10-lb soft armor, 40 pounds of survival items). Such fabrics must be flame and high-heat resistant, and ideally, highly air permeable. A fabric that can provide a slick yet durable lining for the hard armor plate to allow it to slip in and out of a durable outer pocket is also desired. Specific harness components sought include but are not limited to webbings, fasteners, friction adjusters, and closures that comply with ANSI Z359 for fall protection, and are flame resistant, high heat resistant. Webbing fasteners shall meet not only all requirements of the hardware components above but in addition, be able to be quickly disconnected under tension, e.g., an aviator whose harness is snagged in an underwater emergency. Interested component manufacturers (as described above) may be prepared to present product samples of soft and hard components that may enhance the capability of an integrated gear carriage /ballistic/fragmentation hoist/ fall arrest system currently in development. These soft and hard components have the potential to be incorporated into a Dept of Navy system detail specification. Vendors may prepare a list of concerns and questions they may have regarding the requirements for this industry day. No written responses will be provided from the Government. Vendors are encouraged to bring product samples, test results, and evidence of Berry amendment compliance. Vendors are strongly encouraged to avoid the use of presentation software, and to avoid marketing and advertising content. Vendors are requested to provide the name of their company, organization, and/or division group. Vendor participation is limited to no more than 2 people per company. Vendors will have the opportunity to schedule an individual appointment for that day beginning May 27, 2008. Each appointment will be no longer than 20 minutes in duration. The purpose of the appointment is to allow vendors to ask and answer questions in a closed forum. All questions and answers will be recorded and released to the general public. This is not a notice of formal solicitation. Potential requirements for delivery schedules, quantities, and qualification of units have not been established. However suggestions that may assist the Navy in preparing a potential solicitation are welcome. In order to request an appointment for participation in this Industry Day, interested parties shall contact Ms. Marseglia by electronic mail at mary.marseglia@stvinc.com only; no phone calls or other forms of contact shall be used. Industry Day will start at 830 a.m. and end no later than 4 p.m. on Thursday, the 19th of June 2008. The interested vendors will be requested to reconfirm the appointment by a given date, and provide the names and titles of the parties who will be attending.

<DESC>The Southeast Regional Maintenance Center wants to conduct a market survey of the private ship repair industry in accordance with FAR 15.201 to determine industrys views on and interest in providing Navy certified dry-docking facilities and dry docking related services, maintenance and modernization on U.S. Navy Frigates (FFG), Cruisers (CG) and Destroyers (DDG) class ships home-ported in the Mayport, FL area.  The drydocking services and dry docking related maintenance and modernization on Navy ships would include docking, undocking, provision of temporary services as well as maintenance and modernization of ships underwater hull, running gear, sea valves, access cuts, etc.  The period of performance for this contract will start 08 April 2009 and run through 8 April 2014.  Projected dockings will include all scheduled dockings for Mayport homeported ships (15 dockings currently scheduled) and possible emergent dockings during the period of performance.  Place of performance is Jacksonville homeport area. To minimize the time that each ship is taken out of service for repair, upgrades or overhaul, the Navys requirement is to have required topside repairs, alterations and improvement/upgrade work accomplished while the ship is dry docked and the drydocking work is being performed.  The Navy anticipates contracting for the topside work totally separately from this dry-docking contract; however, this dry-docking contract would include the Navys Access to Vessels clause and require that the winner of the dry-docking contract permit the Navys third party topside contractors to come onto their facility and onto the dry-docked ship for the purpose of performing the specific Navy contract topside work to the dry-docked ship on a non-interference basis.  It is the Navys intent to ensure a level playing field for all competitors for topside work, including adding cost factors, as appropriate (for evaluation purposes), to achieve the level playing field.
To fully explore and evaluate what will be required to accomplish this requirement and to identify any and all issues that must be addressed and/or resolved to accomplish the above requirement(s), prospective offerors on this dry-docking procurement and prospective offerors to impacted topside solicitations are invited to express their views, concerns, and interests in writing and to submit their comments and other input to this prospective requirement to the following electronic address as a scanned attachment to an email:

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) is seeking sources with current relevant qualifications, experience, personnel, and capability to perform as the CMc (Construction Manager as Constructor) for the construction of the new United States Courthouse located in San Diego, California.  The Court's current facilities in San Diego do not meet their operational needs and requires additional space to accommodate their 10 year requirements through the year 2012.  The new Federal Courthouse facility will sit on a 2.6 acre, downtown San Diego site, bounded by Broadway Street to the north and State Street to the west.  Union Street will bound the project site to the east and E Street to the south, and both will be completely closed to vehicular traffic.  The project design architect is Richard Meir & Partners Architects LLP, and their design and construction documents have been completed and distributed to GSA as of April 2008.  The new facility encompasses approximately 467,000 gross square feet of space, which includes 98 non-public, underground parking spaces and is programmed to include 14 Courtrooms with an initial build out of 21 Chambers.  The estimated construction cost range is estimated to be between $300 - $328 million.

GSA plans to issue a Best Value Request for Proposal (RFP) which will utilize source selection procedures in accordance with FAR Part 15.  The selection procedure will employ tradeoffs where technical/management factors are significantly more important than price and price related factors.  Following the issuance and evaluation of the RFP, GSA intends to award a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) contract consisting of Pre-Construction Phase Services with an exercisable owner Option for the actual construction.  The current GSA project schedule assumes a pre-construction phase award of October 2008 with a construction start of February 2009.  The project construction duration is approximately 36 months with a year 2012 completion.

BY THIS POSTING, GSA WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN EARLY EXHANGES WITH INDUSTRY.  Parties interested in meeting with the Contracting Officer (Shelita Harper) and Project Manager (Mario Ramirez) should request a meeting by EMAIL no later than COB June 13, 2008 at 4:00 PM.  Meetings with interested parties will be scheduled individually during the week of June 23, 2008.  Please send the EMAIL to christopher.lee@gsa.gov.

This posting serves only as an invitation to express interest for those in the construction marketplace who are capable of performing the anticipated work.  Please note that the Government will not compensate any respondents for information exchanged during these meetings.  Interested parties shall not contact the Architect or their associated Consultants without specific authorization by the contracting officer.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT MS VIRGINIA (GINNY) SLAYTON @ 706-787-2019 OR virginia.slayton@us.army.mil  A.	General Information.<BR>          The Southeast Region (TRBO Reg. 3 & 4), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 46 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and affiliated MTFs in countries of Puerto Rico, Honduras, and Cuba announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Electrodes: Monitoring /  EKG.  <BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR>The major facilities in the Southeast Region include, but are not limited to Eisenhower Army Medical Center (FT Gordon, GA), Winn Army Community Hospital (FT Stewart, GA), Martin Army Community Hospital (FT Benning, GA), Naval Hospital Jacksonville (NAS Jacksonville, FL), 96th Medical Group (Eglin AFB, FL), Naval Hospital Pensacola (Pensacola, FL), Naval Hospital Beaufort (Beaufort, SC), 81st Medical Group (Keesler AFB, MS) and the 6th Medical Group (MacDill AFB, FL).  <BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the PVs for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow PVs to distribute their items. This RFQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement the PV Program. The RFQ will not result in a contract award.  For additional information regarding DSCPs PV program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.  <BR> The resulting RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years.  Anticipated selection date is November/2008.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR>The Point of Contact is Ginny Slayton, phone (706) 787-2019, virginia.slayton@us.army.mil. <BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR><BR>     The Southeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of Electrodes: Monitoring / EKG, which at a minimum includes the product lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $149,975.68.  This forecast is based on historical PV sales during a recent 12-month period.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.<BR><BR>At the request of the Southeast Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the enclosed POC.   Submissions must be received by 5:00 PM EST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region should be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southeast Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR>The Southeast Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Southeast Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to the POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  a.) In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. b). Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR>1.	Vendor MUST provide a complete line of Electrodes: Monitoring/EKG.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. <BR>a.	At a minimum, this product line consist disposable electrodes for EKG and all standard ECG monitoring applications to include electrodes that are radiolucent, with a variety of adhesive backings (foam, soft cloth, micro-pore tape, vinyl tape and clear tape), snap and tab styles, pre-gelled forms (wet-gel, solid gel, and sticky- gel) and available in a variety of diameter sizes (including pediatric, infant and neonatal applications.) <BR>b.	Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed above. (Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I).<BR>2.	Vendor MUST have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for this product line.  Provide the DAPA number in response to this RFQ (Vendors without a DAPA number will be disqualified in Phase I). <BR>3.	Vendor MUST have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (PV), (currently, the PV is Owens & Minor), for distribution in the Southeast Region. (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)  Provide documentation of agreement (four digit number) with PV in response to this RFQ. (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified in Phase I.)   <BR>4.	Vendor MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower uncommitted Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall NOT quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.  Vendors are to provide a quote on discounts in response to this RFQ.  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified. <BR>5.	Vendor MUST provide latex safe/free products.  Vendor MUST provide a complete list of latex safe/free items supplied (catalog, etc.) in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.<BR><BR>Phase II  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to select MTFs for evaluation.  Vendors are required to ship their samples directly to the designated MTFs and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples and literature must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 5:00 PM EST, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical (non-patient care) setting using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable and five (5)-highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.0 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  <BR>To determine acceptability, a Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a clinical (patient care) setting.  Each criterion will be evaluated 10 times by each participating MTF using product sample material.   <BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:  Vendor products meet the Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.0.<BR>1.	(Patient Comfort)  Electrode application is simple and quick.<BR>a.	The Electrode packaging allows easy handling of electrodes for quick application and setup.           <BR>b.	The evaluating Clinician will remove electrodes from packaging, apply to patients skin and attach ECG lead wiring noting if steps to setup were simple and could be done rapidly.<BR>2.	(Patient Safety) Electrodes adhesive backing provides excellent skin contact. <BR>a.	The electrode must make good contact with skin to provide a high quality ECG tracing for patient monitoring.<BR>b.	Evaluating Clinician will lightly tug and attempt to slide electrode out of position to test adhesive grip.<BR>3.	(Patient Comfort) Electrodes stay in place when exposed to moisture.     <BR>a.	Long term monitoring and diagnostic procedures can be complicated by diaphoretic conditions when good skin contact is necessary for quality ECG tracing.<BR>b.	Evaluating Clinician will visually inspect and manipulate electrode to determine if moisture condition has loosen electrodes adhesive grip.<BR>4.	(Patient Safety) Electrode is not irritating or damaging to the skin.      <BR>a.	Long term monitoring requires prolonged exposure to electrode adhesive backing that could cause skin breakdown or adhesive irritations to the skin.<BR>b.	The evaluator will visually inspect the patients skin for signs of irritation or skin  <BR>		breakdown.<BR><BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process.  After the clinical/performance evaluations are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.00 clinical threshold (depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT) will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes as well as product cross-reference data based on a committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided fourteen (14) calendar days to submit their price quotes in the prescribed format as above via email.  Price quotes must be received by 5:00 PM EST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further participation in this RIA initiative. The Southeast Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above.  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.<BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the Government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with three (3) one-year option periods.  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region.  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 27 JUNE 2008 5:00 PM EDT.<BR>

(Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified in Phase I.) Provide supporting documentation (four digit number) of agreement with Prime Vendor with initial submittal.      <BR>4.	Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quotes on discounts, in response to this RFQ.  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified.<BR>5.	Vendors MUST have a local vendor representative for the Southeast Region Medical Treatment Facilities to provide sufficient product implementation services and customer servicing to the multi-service regional facilities.  Vendor MUST provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address with initial submittal.  <BR>6.	Vendors MUST provide any history of back orders and recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for the Advanced Wound Care Products, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.

Vendor MUST provide latex safe/free products.  Vendor MUST provide a complete list of latex safe/free items supplied (catalog, etc.) in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.<BR><BR>Phase II  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to select MTFs for evaluation.  Vendors are required to ship their samples directly to the designated MTFs and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples and literature must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 5:00 PM EST, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.<BR><BR>Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable and five (5)-highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 14 calendar days.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.0 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  <BR><BR>To determine acceptability, a Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting.  Each criterion will be evaluated 5 times by each participating MTF by using product sample material.  <BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:  Vendor products meet the Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.0.<BR>Hydrocolloid<BR>1.	(Patient Safety) Products are easily cut into various sizes and shapes. <BR>a.	Patient wounds vary in size and shape.  Clinicians will need to cut the product to provide the proper dressing size and shape needed for each wound.<BR>b.	Clinician will use a pair of standard bandage scissors to cut the dressing and assess the ability of dressing to be accurately fashioned into customized shapes and sizes.<BR>2.	(Patient Safety) The removal of the dressing product does not cause damage to the underlying or surrounding skin. <BR>a.	You do not want to cause additional damage to patients wound or surrounding skin when removing wound dressing.  Additional skin damage will compromise patients condition and the initial wounds healing.<BR>b.	While using one hand to apply slight pressure to skin adjacent to intact dressing, clinician will slowly remove dressing with his/her other hand and visually assess whether dressing product causes damage to skin beneath dressing and/or surrounding skin.  <BR>3.	(Patient Safety) Dressing adheres to patients skin without edges rolling up. <BR>a.	A totally intact wound dressing remains in position longer and provides the wound with a protective barrier against infectious microorganisms.<BR>b.	Clinician will securely apply dressing to body part.  Clinician will push on dressing edges with fingers attempting to cause edges to roll up and away from skin. Clinician will visibly observe whether; outer edges of applied dressing remained intact (adhering to healthy skin and not rolling up) or rolled up loosening dressings adhesive grip and protective barrier.<BR><BR>        Hydrogel<BR>1.	(Patient Safety) Products are easily cut into various sizes and shapes.<BR>a.	Wounds are different sizes and shapes.  Clinicians will need to cut the product to provide the proper dressing size and shape needed for each patient.<BR>b.	Clinician will use a pair of standard bandage scissors to cut the dressing and assess the ability of dressing to be accurately fashioned into customized shapes and sizes.<BR>2.	(Patient Safety) The removal of the dressing product does not cause damage to the underlying wound.<BR>a.	You do not want to cause additional damage to patients wound or surrounding skin when removing wound dressing.  Additional skin damage will compromise patients condition and the wounds ability to heal.<BR>b.	When removing Hydrogel dressing, the clinician will visually and manually assess whether dressing product adhered to underlying area or easily lifted off underlying area. <BR>3.	(Patient Safety) Dressing maintains a moist wound environment.<BR>a.	A moist wound environment facilitates wound healing and /or debridement in wounds containing dead tissue.<BR>b.	After removal of Hydrogel dressing the clinician will visually assess the site, under the removed dressing, for moist hydrated skin.<BR><BR>        Alginates <BR>1.	(Patient Safety) Dressing maintains its integrity when wet.<BR>a.	Alginate dressings are placed in patients wound bed to absorb exudate (drainage/by- products) while maintaining a moist wound interface.  If the alginate dressing has absorbed wound exudate as intended, it should be intact, in a gelled state, and easily removable from wound bed leaving no fibrous material adhering to the wound bed.<BR>b.	Evaluator will place Alginate dressing in a small open container filled with water and allow the dressing to soak for 30mins.  Evaluator will remove the dressing at the 30 minute mark, using forceps, and assess dressings ability to remain intact when saturated.<BR>2.	(Patient Safety) Dressing is absorbent.<BR>a.	Alginate dressings function to absorb wound exudate (drainage/byproducts) that tend to accumulate and complicate wound healing.<BR>b.	The evaluator will place Alginate dressing in a small open container, filled with water, and allow dressing to soak for 30 minutes.  Evaluator will remove the dressing at the 30 minute time mark and visually and manually inspect dressing for absorbency.<BR>3.	(Patient Safety) Dressing maintains a moist wound environment.<BR>a.	A moist wound environment facilitates wound healing. <BR>b.	Evaluator will wet his/her skin with water, place a 2 in x 2 in gauze sponge (saturated with water) on top of the wet skin area.  Apply alginate dressing on top of wet 2 in x 2 in gauze sponge.  Cover alginate with occlusive dressing.  Keep dressing intact for 30 minutes.  At the 30 minute time mark remove dressings and assess dressing site for moist, hydrated skin.<BR><BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process.  After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum clinical acceptability target threshold (-- at or near 3.0 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores) as determined by the CPT, will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 5:00 PM EST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/participation.  The Southeast region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above.  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined necessary.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs) is considered more important than the other pricing elements. (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  <BR>THE CLOSING DATE IS 27 JUNE 2008 5:00 PM EDT.<BR>

Lake Cushman Bridge is a reinforced concrete girder frame bridge 200 feet long with 5 spans of lengths 12 ft, 53 ft, 70 ft, 53 ft, and 12 ft.  The end spans are cantilevered.  The substructure consists of four reinforced concrete bent piers, all of which are pile supported.  End bents have 6 steel H-piles in a single line with a reinforced concrete cap.  Interior pier bents have two lines of 6 steel H-piles each with a concrete cap supporting a solid shaft pier.  The deck is reinforced concrete with no additional wearing surface.  

The Lake Cushman Bridge was damaged during a winter storm in December, 2007.   The Olympic National Forest intends to acquire by separate contracts:

(1)	A prefabricated, portable bridge and approach ramps; and
(2)	Installation of the prefabricated bridge superstructure and approach ramps.

The prefabricated, portable bridge superstructure and approach ramps will be made to the attached specifications and drawings.  The steel superstructure will be fabricated in an AISC certified plant.  A solicitation will be issued under FAR Part 12 for a commercial supply item.

The proposed method to install the prefabricated superstructure is to roll it over the existing bridge and launching it over the opening between the existing bridge and the existing ground.  There is no vehicle access to the far side of the project.  A solicitation will be issued under FAR Part 12 for a commercial service.  

The Lake Cushman Bridge is located in Washington on the Olympic National Forest on the Hood Canal Ranger District in Mason County and further located in T. 23N., R. 5 W., Section 10.

The process uses commercially available electrodeposited photo-resist (EDPR) to pattern 3-D surfaces. A laser pantograph then patterns the EDPR, which is subsequently developed in a standard, commercially available developer, leaving patterned trench areas in the EDPR. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This then enables precision etching and plating operations. The process requires no micro-machining after the process is complete.</span></p>

This announcement constitutes the only notice; a written solicitation will not be issued.  
Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all proposals received by the closing date specified in the notice.  
A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  JUSTIFICATION FOR SOLE SOURCE:  Item must interface with existing equipment.  Current Air Force and DoD instructions require that imagery be submitted to the Joint Combat Camera Center (JCCC) and the preferred method of transport is the FFT solution.  Northrop-Grumman is the only authorized provider of this software solution.  Other commercially available solutions would require configuring separately purchased software in order to meet the organizations requirements.

<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) plans to procure brand name enterpriseclass IP storage system EMC Celerra NS80.  This announcement is considered a brand name justification.     This is not a solicitation.     This acquisition will be conducted utilizing Part 13 of the FAR, Simplified Acquisition procedures, and the test program authorized in FAR subpart 13.5, and the Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG). THIS ACQUISITION WILL BE CONDUCTED UTILIZING EXISTING USPTO'S INDEFINITE DELIVERY/INDEFINITE QUANITY (ID/IQ) CONTRACTS FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS, A SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.   

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) currently have an urgent production capacity issue of the Patent Search System, currently used in daily production by over 5000 patent examiners, which there is an immediate need to expand the current installed hardware storage infrastructure. The USPTO uses high performance EMC storage to support this critical application. 

The USPTO Technical Reference Model (TRM) defines a comprehensive set of information technology standards, services, interfaces, supporting data formats, and protocols.  The TRM, populated with standards and standards-based commercial products, will serve as the focus to direct the acquisition, development and maintenance of USPTO's AISs within the bounds of USPTO-designated standard products.  The USPTO currently has several deployments of critical production applications running on EMC storage platforms in compliance with the OMB Federal Enterprise Architecture Program Management Office (FEA-PMO).  Supporting activities of the FEA-PMO include two components:  1) Development of a core set of standardized Component-Based Architecture models to facilitate technology solutions and the development of a complete architecture (baseline, target, and transition) for each of the 24 Presidential Priority E-Government initiatives, and (2) The assessment and identification - through high-level architectural, critical success factor, and Line of Business performance information - of new opportunities for business process and system consolidation to improve government efficiency and effectiveness.  The USPTO has committed to aligning its Enterprise Architecture (EA) efforts with the OMB FEA framework.

The equipment described in this justification is consistent with the USPTO approved, standardized and supported, Enterprise storage technical infrastructure.  The use of EMC brand name equipment is required for a number of reasons: (1) The use of an EMC NS80 frame for the Patent Search system is in line with our USPTO storage strategy.  The NS Series provides the agency with high performance Network storage in an expandable configuration. EMC products provide the high Performance, high I/O activity required by the Patent Text Search system.   From a technical requirements perspective, the following items are addressed by using EMC:
 
	No single point of failure that causes loss of performance.
	Capability to provide Raid 1+0 (mirrored) disk configuration for maximum reliability and performance.  
	Provide online upgrades without service interruption.
	Capability of up to 28GB of cache that includes cache that can be tuned for maximum performance for write intensive operations, as required to provide the high performance of the Patent Search Systems.
	Provide expansion capabilities that allow for the addition of both storage and blades without performance degradation.
	Software and firmware levels that is consistent and compatible with the current NAS storage and server environment at the USPTO.

Effective use of this NS80 will result in providing a dedicated environment for the Jupiter cluster of services, with regards to the NAS storage.  This NS80 provides the ability for BRS Middle Tier to continue using a proven technology to support both the Patent Examiners and outside search customers using existing agency policies and procedures.  As this system is integrated with the current Jupiter cluster of services, a common storage framework would be maintained.  The introduction of storage products other then EMC in the Patent Text Search environment will introduce undue risk, unacceptable delays on the project.  (2)  Patent Text Search is a critical component to the Patents business.  There is a critical need to scale the system for the planned addition of up to 600-1000 Patent Examiners this year.

BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
FOR
DEFENSE LOGISTICS AGENCY (DLA)
EMERGENT R&D REQUIREMENTS 
JUNE 4, 2008
________________________________________
POINT OF CONTACT: 	Mr.  John Dormer, Contracting Officer  
Defense Supply Center Philadelphia
DLA Contracting Support Office DSCO-P
700 Robbins Avenue, Building 26-1
Philadelphia, PA 19111 
215-737-2284

1.  BACKGROUND

The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Logistics Research & Development (R&D) Branch is charged with conducting research and development in all areas relevant to the DLA mission and across all DLA supply chains. DLA defines its current R&D requirements each year and seeks funding for them through the Department of Defenses Program Planning, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) process. These planned-for requirements produce a robust logistics R&D program addressing areas such as energy readiness, combat rations, uniform manufacturing, shelters, casting and forging, weapon system sustainment, medical logistics and electronics availability. Despite these ongoing efforts, other R&D requirements arise each year that could not have been anticipated and were not budgeted.

DLAs need for this Emergent (R&D) Requirements BAA stems from the appearance of these unplanned-for R&D requirements that are not addressed by the PPBE process.  Most of these requirements are in the form of additional research areas (beyond those funded by DLAs Presidents Budget request) added by Congress to the DLA R&D appropriation each year. Other emergent requirements come from DLA operations as new challenges to meet some kind of unplanned Agency need in the course of the year. These requirements can address virtually any logistics-related R&D topic and each year generally presents a mixture of new projects and new funding on prior years congressionally directed efforts.
	
2. GENERAL PROPOSAL SUBMISSION INFORMATION

This notice constitutes a combined synopsis/Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2). It is intended that this BAA be open for a period of one year from the date of publication.   No additional information is available, nor shall a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  Requests for same shall be disregarded. Interested entities may submit a white paper for any logistics R&D requirements. The Government reserves the right to request a full technical and cost proposal from any, all, part of, or none of the offerors submitting white papers.  This is an unrestricted acquisition.  Offerors submitting the most promising white papers will be encouraged to submit full technical and cost proposals on all or part of their white paper submission. However, any such encouragement does not guarantee funding or assure a subsequent award. Any responsible source capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a white paper which shall be considered by DLA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit white papers and join others in submitting white papers; however, no portion of this BAA shall be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in this technology.  Large Business concerns will be required to submit a Small Business/Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan.  For purposes of this acquisition, the size standard for Small Business is fewer than 500 employees.  All correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including request for information on how to submit a white paper to this BAA, should be directed to the POC at the top of the BAA; e-mail is preferred.  White papers may NOT be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent shall be disregarded.  

3. AREAS OF INTEREST

DLA is interested in receiving white papers ONLY for R&D for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state of the art or increasing knowledge or understanding in defense logistics. The particular emergent requirements that are the subject of this BAA are: 

(1) to operate a network of lean manufacturing experts who will combine high-level strategic consulting and hands-on assistance to help small to midsized manufacturers who are lower-tier suppliers to DoD primes improve their operations and improve performance by making those suppliers faster, more flexible, leaner and more efficient; 

(2) to provide training and one-on-one assistance to small manufacturing firms to upgrade their capabilities to supply obsolete parts to DoD by enhancing their reverse engineering capabilities, including developing acceptable technical data packages; 

(3) to explore the use of various biofuels feedstocks in jet fuels and examine the impact of introducing biofuels into the current jet fuel delivery stream; 

(4) to develop small manufacturers as DoD suppliers for DLAs Battlefield Back-Order Breakout Initiative (B3I) program , which seeks to provide parts urgently needed in-theater from new suppliers; and

(5) to address parts backorder reduction by conducting requirements analyses and technical risk assessments and developing prototype tools to improve management of warfighter materiel. 

White papers may be based on fundamental research and development; concept formulation; assessment of system and subsystem requirements and processes; development, analysis and evaluation of concepts, systems and subsystems; development of associated industrial capabilities support techniques and processes; development of associated manufacturing techniques and processes; modeling and simulation; simulation-based acquisition; integrated data environments and product data managers; and development of operational systems. 

5. EVALUATION CRITERIA 

White papers will be evaluated using the following evaluation criteria: (1) Overall scientific and technical merits of the proposed effort; (2) Potential relevance and contributions to the area of interest; (3) Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to the area of interest are proposed as well as the degree to which technical data or computer software developed under the proposed effort are to be delivered with unrestricted rights; (4) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (5) The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader or other key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; and (6) Realism and reasonableness of the proposed costs (subject to the availability of funds).  These criteria are listed in descending order of importance, and the non-price factors, when taken together, are significantly more important than price. Any responsible businesses may submit a white paper. White papers may be submitted at any time prior to expiration of the BAA. Please send white papers via e-mail to john.dormer@dla.mil. Please refer to BAA number BAA 0004-08 in all correspondence and communications.  The BAA will remain open for approximately 1 year for submission of white papers. 

6. WHITE PAPER FORMAT

The following guidelines apply to concept papers or white papers. In order to minimize the cost regarding proposal preparation, as a preliminary step, interested parties are advised to submit an initial synopsis (commonly referred to as "white paper"). This white paper should not exceed 5 pages, with a technical description of the effort, a preliminary schedule, identification of risks, and a rough cost estimate. Offerors should submit the white papers electronically.  A title, BAA number, offeror name, project duration, approximate cost, and a brief abstract with information explicitly pertinent to the proposed work must accompany the white paper. The Government reserves the right to request a full technical and cost proposal from any, all, part of, or none of the offerors submitting white papers. Offerors submitting the most promising white papers will be encouraged to submit full technical and cost proposals on all or part of their white paper submission. However, any such encouragement does not guarantee funding or assure a subsequent award. Offerors may submit full technical and cost proposals even if they did not submit a white paper or their white paper was not identified as promising. The Government will acknowledge the receipt of white papers and full technical and cost proposals by e-mail.  White papers for non-innovative, marginal improvements are inappropriate under BAA authority and would not be considered for funding.

The following evaluation factors must be addressed in the white paper:  (1) Overall scientific and technical merits of the proposed effort; (2) Potential relevance and contributions to the area of interest; (3) Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to the area of interest are proposed as well as the degree to which technical data or computer software developed under the proposed effort are to be delivered with unrestricted rights; (4) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (5) The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader or other key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposal objectives.

(1)  OVERALL SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE PROPOSED EFFORT: Offerors will propose a project that includes: (a) The improved logistics capability to be established, expressed in terms of outcomes that are important to the Logistics Support process; (b) Clear description of problem being addressed and tasks to be performed and deliverables to be provided; (c) Realism of (a) and (b) above.

(2) POTENTIAL RELEVANCE AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE AREA OF INTEREST.  Offerors shall propose projects that address (a) the applications of the technology; (b) how the technology will address long and short term needs of the Department of Defense and (c) the expected benefits.

(3) DEGREE TO WHICH NEW AND CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO TECHNICAL ISSUES IMPORTANT TO THE AREA OF INTEREST ARE PROPOSED AS WELL AS THE DEGREE TO WHICH TECHNICAL DATA OR COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPED UNDER THE PROPOSED EFFORT ARE TO BE DELIVERED WITH UNRESTRICTED RIGHTS.

(4) THE OFFEROR'S CAPABILITIES, RELATED EXPERIENCE, FACILITIES, TECHNIQUES OR UNIQUE COMBINATIONS OF THESE WHICH ARE INTEGRAL FACTORS FOR ACHIEVING THE PROPOSAL OBJECTIVES.  Offerors shall provide information pertaining to prior significant and related work experience or expertise in any of the listed areas of interest, and how that expertise shall be beneficial to this program. Offerors shall provide the two largest accounts/contracts/projects within the last three years for which they have provided services and/or supplies of a nature consistent with this program. Offerors shall include at least two (2) points of contact and a telephone number for each account/contract, a description of the service or supply which was provided, as well as a brief performance history on each of those accounts/contracts. Where related work was performed with teaming partners, provide points of contact of teaming members to include company name, individuals and phone numbers. 

(5) THE QUALIFICATIONS, CAPABILITIES AND EXPERIENCE OF THE PROPOSED PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR, TEAM LEADER OR OTHER KEY PERSONNEL WHO ARE CRITICAL IN ACHIEVING THE PROPOSAL OBJECTIVES.

(6) COST REALISM: The cost realism will include a rough estimate of all of the cost information related to the Project Task, including direct labor and indirect costs.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for service in which the government intends to acquire in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service, Pacific Islands Regional Office located in Honolulu, HI requires a contractor for Marine Mammal Assistant Coordinator for monk seal and stranded cetacean response, capacity building and public education for the Island of Maui Hi.</p>
<p>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Pacific Islands Regional Office (PIRO) Protected Resources Division is developing a main Hawaiian Islands Marine Mammal Response Network (MMRN). The purpose of the MMRN is to build capacity for Hawaiian monk seal management response and cetacean stranding response under the MMPA and ESA to prevent disturbance of marine mammals, and to have the appropriate response to marine mammals in need of protection or care, and to respond to deceased marine mammals for sample collection and analysis.</p>
<p>NMFS PIRO oversees the management of Hawaiian monk seals on beaches in the main Hawaiian Islands through the development of a volunteer network. NMFS PIRO oversees the regional activities of the National Stranding Network. There is a need for a trained response assistant coordinator to be stationed on Maui to respond to marine mammal issues as they arise in Maui County (Maui, Lana`i, Moloka`i and Kaho'olawe) as well as the O`ahu, Big Island and Kaua`i.</p>
<p>Background<br />Hawaiian Monk seals<br />Hawaiian monk seals occur principally in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and are one of the world's most endangered seals. In recent years, however, their numbers have increased significantly in the main Hawaiian Islands, particularly on the islands of Niihau and Kauai. Recent surveys suggest that at least 100 seals may now occupy the main Hawaiian Islands. While this increase raises promising new prospects for the species' recovery, it also poses new management challenges. For example, monk seals haul out and give birth on popular recreational beaches where they are subject to harassment by people, and on at least two occasions in the past two years, seals have bitten swimmers. Restricting human use of popular beaches could have significant impacts on local tourism-based economies.</p>
<p>To address these issues, steps were taken to increase public awareness of monk seals: posting temporary safety zones around hauled-out seals to keep people from approaching; moving selected weaned pups from populated beaches to more remote areas; and, on one occasion, temporarily closing a popular public beach to protect a mother-pup pair. Clear guidance on how to address different types of haul-out situations in the main Hawaiian Islands is now in the process of being developed.</p>
<p>NMFS has lead responsibility under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act for protecting monk seals. However, NMFS has been severely limited in addressing issues in the main Hawaiian Islands due in large part to limited staff and funding. Therefore, with little or no funding, state and local agency officials, volunteers, environmental groups, and local businesses have stepped forward to provide valuable assistance to protect hauled-out seals</p>
<p>Cetacean Strandings <br />Strandings are important indicators of cetacean population health and using cetaceans as apex species, strandings can be indicators of ocean health. Each stranding carries with it strong conservation messages as many are related to anthropogenic (human induced) causes. Cetaceans can become entangled in nets, derelict fishing gear, and other marine debris such as plastics. Cetaceans are also known to swallow plastics and collide with vessels. These are all impacts that people can prevent by changing their behaviors in and near the water. Cetaceans may also strand due to natural causes such as old age, disease, and predation. <br />Marine Mammal Response consists of: <br />&bull; Monk seal haulouts/public outreach, seal birthing events (pup rearing monitoring, emergency stranding response). <br />&bull; Marine mammal research and data collection<br />&bull; Cetacean strandings. <br />&bull; Cetacean entanglements, including assistance with and logistical support of large entangled whales and whales struck by vessels<br />&bull; Oil spills and Unusual Mortality Events (UME's) of marine mammals.<br />Hawaiian Monk Seal Response Program<br />Monk seal response programs exist on Kauai, Oahu, Maui and the Big Island with some reporting from Molokai and Lanai. Volunteer programs are in place to routinely assist NMFS PIRO and the Pacific Island Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) in monk seal response issues. Volunteers assist with the following: <br />The term response here takes many forms: <br />&bull; Simply responding to a call of a hauled out monk seal to verify and assess the situation. <br />&bull; Creating a Seal Protection Zone (see protocols) around a seal that is on a popular beach<br />&bull; Collecting sightings information and providing it to PIFSC.monksealsighting@noaa.gov<br />&bull; Assisting PIRO and PIFSC staff with the relocation of a seal<br />&bull; Responding to verify that a seal that is in trouble (hooked or entangled) or otherwise communicate with and refer special cases to designated leaders and/or to the NOAA Hotline for Hawaii 888-256-9840<br />&bull; Responding to a haul out, taking digital images and sending them to PIRO and/or PIFSC<br />&bull; Offering public passersby information about the Hawaiian monk seal and its endangered status as instructed, about:<br />&bull; Hawaiian monk seals<br />&bull; Basic biology and behavior<br />&bull; Viewing guidelines<br />&bull; Management actions</p>
<p>Cetacean Stranding Program<br />In Hawaii, PIRO oversees the local cetacean stranding network which is part of a National Stranding Network which includes all US states that border the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans as well as the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>In Hawaii, two primary entities have NMFS authorization to respond to and "take" marine mammals for rescue, rehabilitation, release of live cetaceans and necropsy and sampling of those that wash ashore dead or those that strand alive but die or are humanely euthanized. Hawaii Pacific University (HPU) is designated to respond to and sample dead stranded cetaceans and University of Hawaii at Hilo (UHH) is designated to respond to and care for live cetaceans with the goal of release back to the wild.</p>
<p><br />Goals and Objectives</p>
<p>The goal of this contract is to build the necessary capacity for monk seal response and cetacean stranding response and to provide assistance to the Marine Mammal Response Network Coordinator (MMRNC) stationed on Oahu (NMFS PIROO). To accomplish this goal, NMFS PIRO seeks to achieve the following objectives with this contract:</p>
<p>1. Expand the capacity of marine mammal response in Hawaii by hiring a contractual assistant coordinator for a term of 12 months to be put in place January 20th, 2009. <br />2. Build the capacity to demonstrate appropriate response to marine mammal situations <br />3. Outreach and messaging will be disseminated to the public in various forums using various outreach tools <br />4. Provide back up when the MMRNC is off island or otherwise engaged in other activities</p>
<p><br />Specific Tasks</p>
<p><br />The contractor (Island Coordinator) will be responsible for performing the following tasks in cooperation with Hawaii Pacific University under the direction of the NMFS PIRO MMRN Coordinator:<br /><br />a. Coordinate locally the response to seal haulouts and pupping events on the Maui which will include but not be limited to providing daily or weekly updates on the seal mother pair (progress, harassment, and nursing and behavioral data). <br />b. Travel to neighbor islands to assist with pupping or stranding events.<br />c. Develop a recruitment plan for community involvement in marine mammal response and work to develop zones of response with a phone tree around the island of Maui<br />d.

Invoicing Instructions - Mandatory:  

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are to be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Department of Defense, have determined that Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil is the preferred electronic method to be used.  However, if your available computer hardware or computer configuration is incompatible with WAWF, the Web Invoicing System (WinS) at https://ecweb.dfas.mil may be used or any other mutually agreed to electronic method may be used in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause.

Vendors must register in the WAWF system at https://wawf.eb.mil.  If you have questions during the registration process, you can call the WAWF help desk at (866) 618-5988.

The WAWF system provides for submission of invoices in several different forms.  It is recommended that an Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) be used when the contract/order is for supplies and an Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) be used when the contract/order is for services.   Using these types of WAWF documents automatically generates an e-mail notification to the receiver that their acceptance is required for the document to be processed for payment.    

Due to the fact that our office processes contracts/orders for various receivers from other agencies, we cannot at this time guarantee that the Deliver To code in block 15 of the Standard Form 1449 is registered and active in WAWF.  If the code is not active in the WAWF system, you will be unable to use either the Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) or the Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) option in WAWF.  In this case, you will need to enter your invoice using the Invoice option.  This will generate a stand-alone invoice not associated with a receiving report.  The receiving office will then be required to separately submit their receiving report to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for processing.

Use of the WAWF electronic invoicing system can decrease the time required to process an invoice.  It also allows for tracking invoices and acceptance on-line without further correspondence.

(End of provision)

Filing Agency Protests
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the 
ADDENDA TO FAR 52.212-4
                          CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONSCOMMERCIAL ITEMS (Feb 2007)

Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.           

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.     The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.           Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.           Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.     The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.     To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).     Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<p>This effort will require "Haworth" brand name products be provided.</p>
<p>IAW FAR 6.302-1(c),&nbsp;an acquisition that uses a brand name description or other purchase description to specify a particular brand name, product, or feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer does not provide for full and open competition regardless of the number of sources solicited. It shall be justified and approved in accordance with FAR 6.303 and 6.304. The justification should indicate that the use of such descriptions in the acquisition is essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company. See 5.102(a)(6) for the requirement to post the brand name justification.</p>
<p>IAW FAR 5.102(a)(6), when an acquisition contains brand name specifications, the contracting officer shall include with the solicitation the justification or documentation required by 6.302-1(c), 13.106-1(b), or 13.501, redacted as necessary (see 6.305).</p>

Only the purchase of additional Haworth tables and chairs will match existing furniture in this important and vital learning environment and provide for a professional and uniform appearance. A professional and uniform appearance for the USAFSAM is essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.</p>

<p>The items are being procured to provide a comfortable and professional educational environment for all USAFSAM students. It is vital that the current professional appearance of the significant amount of existing Haworth furniture which was purchased for the USAFSAM last year be maintained to ensure a tasteful and professional environment continues to exist for the medical student attendees.</p>

Amendment 4

The purpose of Amendment 4 is to incorporate the following FAR clauses.   

5.1  52.212-1  INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (NOV 2007)
 
   (a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees.
 
   (b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show --
 
     (1) The solicitation number;
 
     (2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;
 
     (3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror;
 
     (4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;
 
     (5) Terms of any express warranty;
 
     (6) Price and any discount terms;
 
     (7) "Remit to" address, if different than mailing address;
 
     (8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(l) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically);
 
     (9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments;
 
     (10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and
 
     (11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.
 
   (c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.
 
   (d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.
 
   (e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.
 
   (f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.
 
     (1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
 
     (2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--
 
         (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or
 
         (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
 
         (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
 
       (ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
 
     (3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.
 
     (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
 
     (5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.
 
   (g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.
 
   (h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.
 
   (i) Availability of requirements documents cited in the solicitation.
 
     (1)(i) The GSA Index of Federal Specifications, Standards and Commercial Item Descriptions, FPMR Part 101-29, and copies of specifications, standards, and commercial item descriptions cited in this solicitation may be obtained for a fee by submitting a request to--

     (4) Nongovernment (voluntary) standards must be obtained from the organization responsible for their preparation, publication, or maintenance.
 
   (j) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number. (Applies to all offers exceeding $3,000, and offers of $3,000 or less if the solicitation requires the Contractor to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address.

If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. An offeror within the United States may contact Dun and Bradstreet by calling 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://www.dnb.com.

   (k) Central Contractor Registration. Unless exempted by an addendum to this solicitation, by submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation. If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
 
     (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

       (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
 
     (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
 
     (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

TITLE: B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM RFP - FINAL REVIEW
DESCRIPTION: The B-2 Training System RFP is in Final Review.  The B-2 Training System team intends to release the Final RFP, once Business Clearance is approved.  This notice of contract action is required to satisfy FAR 5.2 Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions, specifically 5.203 Publicizing and Response Time.
PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM RECOMPETE  UPDATE
DESCRIPTION:  THE PAST PERFORMANCE VOLUME MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 15 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.  THE REST OF THE PROPOSAL MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 45 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.
SECTION M, PARAGRAPH 2.1.1 MISSION CAPABILITY TECHNICAL RATING, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE WAS ADDED TO THE END OF THE PARAGRAPH: THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSIDER PROVIDING POSITIVE EVALUATION CREDIT FOR EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS, DEPENDING UPON THE BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED TO INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INITIAL DRAFT RFP.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

<RESPDATE>070208
<CONTACT>Timothy E Pink, Supervisory Procurement Analyst, Phone DSN 833-0007, Email timothy.pink@losangeles.af.mil - Marilyn K. Washington, Contracting Officer, Phone (310) 653-2072, Email marilyn.washington@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC><p>Satellite Control and Network Systems Group (SCNG) intends to issue a contract action for the procurement of eleven (11) follow-on telemetry, tracking, and commanding (TT&amp;C) core electronics and antennas, plus one (1) additional transportable RBC antenna for the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) Remote Tracking Station (RTS) Block Change (RBC). The proposed action will be awarded as a new Satellite Control Network Contract (SCNC), and will be a Fixed-Price Incentive contract for satellite and network control services and support. The original ordering period on the SCNC contract has expired due to Government funding constraints and the complexity of RBC development.</p>
<p>This effort involves the procurement and fielding of the core electronics and antenna facilities for 11 AFSCN ground stations with possible options to enhance the network's capability by fielding more ground stations world wide. The AFSCN is the Department of Defense's (DoD) primary network for supporting launch and early orbit operations. The AFSCN provides TT&amp;C, mission data dissemination, and processing. It is also one of the nation's primary high-powered networks for emergency anomaly resolution of space vehicles.</p>
<p>The AFSCN currently consists of legacy Automatic Remote Tracking Stations (ARTS) and is undergoing a modernization to state-of-the-art tracking stations (RBC upgrade). There are five (5) RBC antennas, one (1) transportable RBC antenna, one (1) RBC Integration and Support Suite (RISS), and one (1) Eastern Vehicle Checkout Facility (EVCF) RBC project currently on contract. This next contract will continue the modernization effort for the rest of the AFSCN by replacing the remaining legacy ARTS core electronics and antenna systems with RBC systems and adding new, additional remote tracking stations to the network. This core electronics and antenna upgrade will include, but not be limited to, the following deliverables:</p>
<p>1. Project Management<br />2. Project Systems Engineering<br />3. Configuration Management<br />4. Hardware Design &amp; Development<br />5. Software Design &amp; Development<br />6. Procurement<br />7. Production<br />8. System Integration, Assembly, Checkout, &amp; Shipping<br />9. Test &amp; Evaluation<br />10. Data &amp; Documentation<br />11. Integration Logistics Support<br />12. Environmental Engineering Compliance<br />13. Site Acquisition, Installation, &amp; Acceptance</p>
<p>The value for these supplies and services is estimated at $338,000,000.</p>
<p>The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether potential offerors exist that are capable of achieving program objectives within acceptable cost, performance, and schedule parameters. Honeywell Technology Solutions, Inc. (HTSI) was awarded the Satellite Control Network Contract (SCNC) in December 2001 and is presently on contract for development of the first five (5) RBC articles. Due to requirements and schedule changes, the ordering period for the remaining eleven (11) RBC articles has expired. The nature of this acquisition is unique due to the complexity of integrating both legacy and systems currently in development. HTSI has performed identical work on the previous RBC articles. All responsible sources may submit a Statement of Capabilities (SOC) that will be considered. The Government anticipates that there may be a small percentage of set-asides for this action. Responses from small and small disadvantaged<br />businesses are encouraged. The current expected contract order award date is the first or second quarter of fiscal year 2009.</p>
<p>Responsible sources interested in this notice may submit their SOC with documented evidence of their capability to meet all cost, performance, and schedule requirements electronically no later than 02 Jul 2008 to the Points of Contact (POC) listed below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer to the four (4) attached technical documents:</p>
<p>1. RBC Requirements Document (RD)<br />2. Transportable RBC Unique &amp; Common Requirements<br />3. Waivers/Requirements Clarifications<br />4. AFSCN CONOPS</p>

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause
(1) Contract financing payment and invoice payment have the meanings given in section 32.001 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
(2) Electronic form means any automated system that transmits information electronically from the initiating system to all affected systems.

(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this clause, the Contractor shall submit payment requests and receiving reports using WAWF, in one of the following electronic formats that WAWF accepts: Electronic Data Interchange, Secure File Transfer Protocol, or World Wide Web input. Information regarding WAWF is available on the Internet at https://wawf.eb.mil/.
(c) The Contractor may submit a payment request and receiving report using other than WAWF only when
(1) The Contracting Officer authorizes use of another electronic form. With such an authorization, the Contractor and the Contracting Officer shall agree to a plan, which shall include a timeline, specifying when the Contractor will transfer to WAWF;
(2) DoD is unable to receive a payment request or provide acceptance in electronic form;
(3) The Contracting Officer administering the contract for payment has determined, in writing, that electronic submission would be unduly burdensome to the Contractor. In such cases, the Contractor shall include a copy of the Contracting Officers determination with each request for payment; or
(4) DoD makes payment for commercial transportation services provided under a Government rate tender or a contract for transportation services using a DoD-approved electronic third party payment system or other exempted vendor payment/invoicing system (e.g., PowerTrack, Transportation Financial Management System, and Cargo and Billing System).
(d) The Contractor shall submit any non-electronic payment requests using the method or methods specified in Section G of the contract.

<p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT.</p>
<p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Disaster Prevention and Response Branch , hereby announces its intent to award a contract to Simtars, located in Queensland, Australia, for the purchase of a Safegas Tube Bundle Gas Monitoring System.</p>
<p>NIOSH researchers seek to acquire a continuous monitoring system that can draw samples through tubes from deep within sealed areas of coal mines and elsewhere within the active parts of underground coal mines. In acquiring this system, NIOSH researchers will collect scientific information to prevent explosions within sealed areas of coal mines and will also demonstrate practical monitoring technology to the U.S. underground coal mining industry in support of the new MSHA final rule on sealing of abandoned areas of coal mines. So-called "tube-bundle systems" are the best and only technology available to collect and analyze the sealed area atmosphere.</p>
<p>Hardware specifications for automated tube-bundle system</p>
<p>1. The system must have at least 30 remote sample-draw points, and the system should readily expand to 60.<br />2. The sample-draw points may be up to 4.5 miles (7 km) away. <br />3. Each sample tube is polyethylene about 1/2 in OD (13 mm), 3/8 in ID (10 mm) or more.<br />4. Continuous draw on each sample tube is required.<br />5. Flow rate in each tube should range from 0.04 to 0.07 cubic feet per minute (1 to 2 liters per minute). Flow velocity should range from 0.5 to 2 feet per second (0.15 to 0.6 m per second).<br />6. End-of-line filter, water trap, flame arrester, flow control and 3 way solenoid valve for each sample line are required.<br />7. The system should have multiple main sample-draw pumps capable of evacuating all sample tubes continuously. Pumps should be sized commensurate with the sample-draw length (4.5 miles or 7 km) and will run on 110 VAC. NIOSH engineers estimate that pumps should be about 1 horsepower (746 watts) each.<br />8. The system will have a secondary pump capable of evacuating one (1) tube to deliver sample to analyzer. This pump may be smaller horsepower than the main pump and will run on 110 VAC.<br />9. The vendor will specify the sample tube size and length; however, NIOSH will provide tube. <br />10. The sample-draw system should have a blow back functionality on each line.</p>
<p>Gas analysis specifications</p>
<p>11. The required gas analysis sensors and instruments are methane, oxygen and carbon dioxide. The required ranges and measurement accuracies are:<br />&bull; Methane - 0 to 100% by volume to within +/- 1% full scale<br />&bull; Oxygen - 0 to 30% by volume to within +/- 1% full scale<br />&bull; carbon dioxide - 0 to 30% by volume to within +/- 1% full scale<br />12. Filter, water trap, flame arrester, flow restrictor and flow meter to each gas analysis sensor or instrument are required.<br />13. Positive pressure bypass valve for manually-collected gas samples from each of the sample-draw tubes is required.<br />14. Vendor will specify calibration and span gases of appropriate composition; however, NIOSH will acquire the gases directly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>System control and data collection specifications</p>
<p>15. Programmable logic controller or computer to automatically control the cycle through all sample tubes, in any specified order and frequency will be provided. The desired system will sample each tube at least every 4 hours. <br />16. The system will analyze calibration and span gases every week of operation.<br />17. The system will monitor and record the vacuum on each sample tube with an appropriate degree of precision.<br />18. The system will monitor and record the barometric pressure at least every hour. <br />19. A data collector will record all gas analysis, calibration, sample-draw pressure and barometric pressure results from each sample tube each sampling cycle. The storage device will have sufficient capacity to hold gas analysis readings and time data from at least six months of continuous operation.</p>
<p>Data display and analysis software specifications</p>
<p>20. The data display and analysis software system will be based on a Windows interface.<br />21. The software system will display the mine plan where the system is installed and the sample point locations.<br />22. The software system will display current gas composition data for each point and give the history of that composition on command.<br />23. The software system will display composition data and trends on both a Coward triangle and an Ellicott diagram on command.<br />24. The software system will provide notification and sound appropriate alarms when critical composition thresholds are exceeded.<br />25. The software system will monitor key hardware in the tube-bundle system and record its functionality. <br />26. The software system will provide a full record of alarms and the operator action.<br />27. Access to the software system will be password protected to prevent unauthorized changes to any operational parameters. <br />28. The software system will function in a client/server configuration and enable many remote workstations to share and display the data.</p>
<p>System support specifications</p>
<p>29. The vendor will pre-assemble and package system into instrumentation panels or racks suitable for transport and installation at a mine location in a room, portable building or other weatherproof container. The system will be ready to have sample tubes and power hooked up in the field. <br />30. Vendor will supply complete electronic documentation of all system components.<br />31. Vendor will supply any special installation and repair tools for the system.<br />32. Required delivery time is within 3 months of order placement.<br />33. The system will meet all MSHA regulations (intrinsic safety requirements) for safe use in an underground coal mine.<br />34. The vendor will provide documentation that a similar system exists and is in operation in at least 2 underground coal mines in the world where they have operated successfully for at least one (1) year.<br />35. The vendor will provide at least 2 days of on-site training of NIOSH personnel on the operation and maintenance of the system.</p>

Offerors should verify in writing which items are listed on their GSA schedule contracts and which items are "open market" items. For an offer to qualify as an offer based on a GSA schedule contract, the value of "open market" items included in the offer may not exceed the applicable micro-purchase threshold as defined in FAR 2.101.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the CA/CST/TI.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Dell EMC DAE2 2Gb Disk Array Enclosure.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST/II requires this additional SAN shelf to provide capacity for  a potential growth of 40% of applicants.  Per the manufacturer, the DAE2 (2-gigabit disk-array enclosure) is a highly available, high-performance, high-capacity storage system that uses a Fiber Channel Arbitrated Loop (FC-AL) as its interconnect interface.  An enclosure connects to another DAE2 or a storage processor, and is managed by storage-system software in RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disk) configurations.  The enclosure is only 3U (5.25 inches) high, but can include 15 hard disk drives.  Its modular, scalable design provides additional disk storage as your needs increase.  The DAE2 can support up to fifteen 3.5-inch, Fiber Channel disk modules.  It uses the Fiber Channel interface to connect disk modules together.  Simple serial cabling provides easy scalability.  You can interconnect as many as eight DAE2s to Fiber Channel loops (sometimes called busses) to form a large disk storage system.  The number of loops depends on the capabilities of your storage processor; highly available configurations require at least two loops, other configurations use a single loop.  You can place the disk enclosures in the same cabinet, or in one or more separate cabinets.The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.The Dell EMC DAE2 2Gb Disk Array Enclosure is required as the EDV program is currently housed and processed on DELL equipment.  The requested DELL Disk Drives will be an upgrade to the existing equipment and is the only product that the DELL vendor will support.The Dell EMC DAE2 2Gb Disk Array Enclosure has undergone test and assessment and has received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

VIEW THE UPDATED CONFERENCE AGENDA HIGHLIGHTS BELOW.
The Annual FAA National Small Business Procurement Opportunities Training Conference and Trade Show will be hosted, June 16-19, 2008, at The Riviera Hotel Convention Center located at 2901 Las Vegas Blvd., South, Las Vegas, NV  89109.  The forum will provide small businesses knowledge on how to contract with the FAA, marketing strategies, and give current information on FAA procurement opportunities (such as construction, information technology support services, management services, technical support services, engineering services, facilities support services, environmental services, telecommunications services, major system and subsystem manufacturing, security guard services, architectural and training services etc.)
The FAA annually obligates more than $3 billion in goods and services (over $1 billion a year in support services awarded to small businesses.)

The FAA continues to aggressively reach out to the nation's small businesses  by conducting technical panel sessions and procurement opportunity workshops that are specifically focused on awarding contracts and subcontracts to small businesses.  Workshop sessions will address technical program requirements and business issues as well as provide detailed procurement information that will help increase small business opportunities with the FAA.
Small businesses are encouraged to market their capabilities during one-on-one marketing sessions with large primes, federal agency technical and procurement subject matter experts, and by participating in the Exhibit Hall Trade Show.  Large businesses with major FAA contracts will also be on-hand to provide specific subcontracting opportunities and conduct industry subcontracting/mentor-protg workshops (i.e., Harris, ITT, Tremco, AMTI, Lockheed Martin, Parsons, L-3 Communications, Wells Fargo, GEICO, Raytheon and many more.)

<DESC>Amendment 002 is hereby issued to extend the closing date from June 9, 2008, 4:30 p.m. local time to June 16, 2008, 4:30 p.m. local time.
Spreadsheet referenced as an attachment is being provided.  At this time, we are looking for capability statements and will not be providing the drawings.

*******************************
Amendment 001 is hereby issued to extend the closing date from June 2, 2008, 4:30 p.m. to June 9, 2008, 4:30 p.m. local time.
Spreadsheet referenced as an attachment in paragraph 1 was an inadvertent entry in the announcement and will not be provided.
***********************The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, has a requirement to purchase a multiple carrier wireless/cell phone in-building connectivity system, post implementation support and maintenance support.  MMAC is a campus environment and is comprised of over fifty buildings plus tunnels connecting certain major buildings.  The wireless/cell phone in-building connectivity requirement will start with the fifteen most heavily occupied buildings (see spreadsheet), the Security Command center and the tunnel area.  Options for adding buildings should be included.  This requirement is to provide all personnel with cell phone connectivity within buildings, in basements and tunnel areas.  This requirement should also take into account the radar signals at MMAC and should in no way interfere with those signals.
Various organizations have purchased and installed Wilson amplifiers, duplexers, and antennas.  However, the current equipment covers only specific areas of those buildings where it is installed.  The purpose for this request for information is to have connectivity throughout all buildings including the tunnel area.
If the MMAC telephone switch were to incur loss of function, the cell phone in-building connectivity would allow for communication to continue.  Also, when all personnel are sent to the basements and tunnel areas during times of impending weather, this connectivity would assure continued communication and could be utilized, if required, as part of disaster recovery communication.  
Drawings are currently available for the top fifteen buildings, however due to security risks, these drawings will be available on an as needed basis and will require a non-disclosure agreement.  The drawings will be signed out to the requesting party and will be returned to the FAA after use.  The drawings are in electronic format and require AutoCad software for viewing.
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 517210; Wireless Telecommunications Carriers, with a small business size standard of 1,500 employees.
Responses to this market survey will be used to develop the source list for this requirement and to determine if there is adequate competition to set the requirement aside for Small Businesses, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, or the 8(a) program in lieu of opening the acquisition up for full and open competition.  
Interested vendors should respond with the following:1.	Documentation that clearly demonstrates that the interested vendor is capable of fulfilling the requirement as evidenced by answering the questions that follow.  (The format of the documentation is at the discretion of the vendor)a.	Can the vendor provide signal for wireless telecommunications (cell phones, pagers, Blackberry, etc) to building, including basement and tunnel areas.  If yes, please provide proof.b.	The FAA has a national wireless program and provides various carrier devices.  Can vendor's equipment provide non-carrier specific service?  c.	Explain how the vendor provides service in b.d.	What equipment is required?e.	Does the vendor install the equipment?f.	Does the vendor maintain equipment after installation?g.	Is there a instructional class that the FAA technicians can attend for certification to maintain the equipment?h.	Is the equipment currently installed in another government facility?  If so, include location and point of contact.i.	When is the vendor available to begin installation and how much time is required for completion?j.	The equipment would be located in our telecommunications' closets.  Is the equipment wall mounted, rack mounted, etc?k.	All buildings have shielding (older buildings have wire mesh, new buildings have metal faces).  Will vendor's equipment/signal work with shielded buildings?l.	Give an explanation of your company, equipment and services, not to exceed 20 pages.
2.	Complete and return the attached Business Declaration Form.   The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each offeror's program eligibility.
The survey is not to be construed as a screening information request (SIR), nor request for offer (RFO).  As such, the FAA will not accept unsolicited proposals and will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  Responders to this announcement may be asked to provide additional details/information based on their initial response.  The final determination by the FAA not to open this requirement to competition, based on any information provided, is solely within the discretion of the FAA.
 All responses should clearly be labeled WIRELESS.  Vendors must respond by 4:30 p.m. (CST), June 2, 2008.  Responses should be submitted electronically in either a portable document format (ie. *.pdf file) or Microsoft Word to: Diana.Pickel@faa.gov.  FAA will not respond telephonic inquiries.
Note:  Any contract awarded resulting from this survey will contain the AMS Clause 3.3.1-33 Central Contractor Registration (April 2006).  Award cannot be made to a vendor that has not accomplished this registration.
This Notice is for informational purposes for Minority, Women-Owned and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises:  The Department of Transportation (DOT), Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, has a program to assist small businesses, small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and women-owned concerns to acquire short-term working capital assistance for transportation-related contracts. Loans are available under the DOT Short Term Lending Program (STLP) at prime interest rates to provide accounts receivable financing.  The maximum line of credit is $750,000.  For further information and applicable forms concerning the STLP, call the OSDBU at (800) 532-1169.

<a href="mailto:jones.denise-t@epamail.epa.gov">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 336612   This amendment was necessary to provide clarification to the following questions posed by a potential bidder:
Ques 1:  The depth rating for the proposed ROV is 1,000 feet, but the umbilical length is listed at 500 feet.  Although we are able to provide a shorter umbilical length, it will be an underutililzation of the ROV's specifications.  And indeed, if you only have a need for the 500 feet umbilical, we have an ROV that has a 500 feet depth rating, similar features to the deeper rated ROV, that would result in a more cost-effective system.  Please verify with the solicitation author the requested ROV depth rating and umbilical length. 
Answer:  Even though the ROV's depth rating is 1000 feet, at this point in time we are only going to utilize the minimum amount of reel (500 feet).  Even so we still want the capability of being able to do deeper work if the need arises.  
Ques 2:  The solicitation requests three types of operational cameras.  In regard to the "rear facing movable fixed focus color camera," is maneuverability needed during operations or will changing a fixed mounting prior to deployment fit the bill?   Answer:  The rear camera's function is to essentially back out the ROV if it becomes entangled.  Maneuverability is needed.    

Ques 3:  Are you looking for a vectored thrust vehicle  with three axis of operational control or an ROV with four thrusters that provides forward, vertical, and lateral movement?
Answer:   We need a ROV that can move forward, backwards, side to side and up and down.  What's more important is a ROV that can handle strong currents and have the capabilities to pull/link the umbilical at a long length.  
No other changes are made to this solicitation.

<DESC>The Technology Applications Program Office (TAPO) is seeking a light weight replacement for the current heavy steel Ballistic Protection System (BPS) currently used on its rotary wing aircraft.  As a result TAPO has the requirement to conduct a live fire test on readily available aircraft armor panels (ballistic protection).  These systems should encompass the gamut of light weight ballistic protection to meet the objective and threshold requirements below.  Those firms who would like to participate in these live fire tests are invited to provide one 1 x 1 (one-foot-square) panel and four 6 x 6 (six-inch-square) panels at no cost to the government for the governments use in the test.  Ballistic performance tests will be carried out using the following criteria:  Range/ Obliquity - 100 meters stand-off from muzzle and zero obliquity (100m, 0 Deg);  Ballistic Protection - 
Threshold - 7.62mm x 39 M1943 Type PS ball, Objective - 7.62mm x 54R Type LPS and  Repeatability - 2 rounds within a 1 diameter.  The armor should be in its deployable state (i.e. have any and all coatings typically used when in normal operation in a combat environment) and at an Areal weight with a Mass Efficiency (ME) of 3 or greater, as compared to RHA.   Mark your panels with appropriate markings to reflect supplier, type of material, and armor fabrication.  Firms will only be provided the results from their own ballistic panel test event and will not have access to another firms result.  This is a Government only test event and participating firms cannot witness the test.  Additionally, the Government requests the written composition of the armor panel to determine if any material or environmental concerns exist.  These details will be maintained by the Government and will not be shared with other firms.  The Government conducted live fire test is anticipated to occur in early July 08.  As a result each firms panels must be delivered no later than 30 June 08.  TAPO Technical POC for this action is Sean Heatherman, Aerospace Engineer, (757) 878-3299 ext 266
