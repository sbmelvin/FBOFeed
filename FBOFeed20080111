<DESC>NASA/NSSC has a requirement for a training course entitled ?MATLAB Fundamentals & Programming Techniques" and "Simulink for Dynamic System Modeling?.  The objective of this course is to provide specialized training for technical personnel at NASA's Langley Research Center on the MATLAB and Simulink software products. The course shall include: an introduction to the MATLAB technical computing environment, themes of data analysis, visualization, programming techniques for aerospace applications, algorithm modeling, design validation, applying basic modeling techniques, and tools for developing Simulink block diagrams. The vendor shall be responsible for providing all necessary training materials to include: software, training manuals, and textbooks.  The vendor shall conduct a four day course consisting of a two day session on "MATLAB Fundamentals & Programming Techniques for Aerospace Applications" and a two day session on "Simulink for Dynamic System Modeling". Training shall be held at NASA?s Langley Research Center on March 4-7, 2008. NASA/NSSC intends to purchase the training course from The Mathworks, Inc. 3 Apple Hill Drive, Natick, MA 01760.  Pursuant to FAR 13.106, the acquisition of these services has been determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1) This is an existing commercial course that meets the needs of NASA without need for further modification or tailoring; 2) The MATLAB and Simulink software products were developed by the vendor and the vendor conducts this training using a cadre of its engineering staff; 3) The vendor?s unique knowledge of the software products coupled with its extensive course offerings and training experience  provides NASA with a cost-effective, timely, training solution that can not be readily duplicated by any other source within the timelines required. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on January 25, 2008.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Capabilities and qualifications should be submitted to Megan Willis at Megan.M.Willis@nasa.gov. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, an agency within the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) under the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), serves as the national focus for developing and applying disease prevention and control, environmental health, and health promotion and health education activities designed to improve the health of the people of the United States.  Substantial portions of CDC resources are directed toward conducting unique surveys, epidemiologic studies, and research programs in which primarily human biologic materials are collected, characterized, tested, and a portion stored for future laboratory investigations.  In a number of instances the biologic materials obtained in these investigations cannot be replaced or obtained elsewhere.  Collectively, these materials represent a unique public health resource that may prove invaluable in future investigations.  The CDC and ATSDR Specimen Packaging, Inventory, and Repository (CASPIR) is intended as a repository for valuable, primarily human, biological materials obtained through CDC and ATSDR programs and activities.  Well-characterized specimens/collections are stored that could be of potential use for future scientific endeavors.  These specimens/collections are inventoried and stored under controlled optimal conditions. The CDC will seek through solicitation/Request for Proposal, a contractor that will provide all labor, materials, equipment, supplies, supervision, and also perform all services required to operate and maintain the CDC and ATSDR Specimen and Data Bank (CASPIR) to ensure that valuable collections of primarily human biological materials, including blood components, tissue, bacterial isolates, DNA, and other biological and environmental specimens, obtained through CDC programs and activities are properly inventoried, securely stored, maintained, managed, and when needed, retrieved and delivered to scientists.  (Some aliquoting of specimens may be necessary.)   The anticipated performance period of these services is April 1, 2008 through March 31, 2009 with four 12 month option periods.  The solicitation is scheduled to be posted online at www.fbo.gov on or around November 28, 2007.  Inquiries will only be accepted in writing after the solicitation has been posted in accordance with the instructions in Section L of the solicitation.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be available from CDC.  Contract award is contemplated no later than March 31, 2008.

<DESC>MOX FUEL PROJECT - OPTION 1 The Chicago Operations Office of the Department of Energy plans to exercise Option 1 to Contract DE-AC02-99CH10888 for Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication and Reactor Irradiation Services in support of the National Nuclear Security Administration's Fissile Material Disposition Program.  The goal of this element of the program is to safely disposition 34 metric tons of U.S. surplus weapons-grade plutonium.  To that end, DOE has pursued the transformation of plutonium oxide powder derived from the surplus plutonium to the spent fuel standard (making the plutonium as difficult to recover and as unattractive for use in weapons as the plutonium in existing commercial spent nuclear fuel). This requires both fuel fabrication and reactor irradiation services.  It has been DOE's preference that both of these services be coupled and integrated by a single entity.  On March 22, 1999, Contract Number DE-AC02-99CH10888 was awarded to the consortium Duke, COGEMA, Stone & Webster, LLC (DCS), currently located at 128 South Tryon Street, Charlotte, NC 28202, as a base contract with three options, for MOX Fuel Fabrication and Irradiation Services.  These services include the design, construction, licensing, operation and deactivation of the MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF); performing fuel qualification and fuel design activities necessary to obtain NRC approval for the use of MOX fuel in commercial light water reactors (CLWR's); performing reactor core design, reactor facility modification design and modifications, and licensing activities required to permit the irradiation of MOX fuel elements in CLWR's; design and procurement of fresh MOX fuel transportation packages; and the managerial and technical integration of all activities. The consortium approach has maximized private sector participation and provides for the coordination of all services within the consortium.  The consortium approach also has encouraged traditional business relationships among fuel designers, fuel fabricators, reactor vendors, reactor operators, and architect-engineers, including retaining the long-standing relationship between utilities and their fuel fabricators.  Negotiations and contractual relationships have also been simplified by the consortium approach. The initial ("Base") contract is a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for facility design, license application, and fuel qualification activities. Specifically, the Base portion of the contract includes the following:  Design and initial licensing activities for the MFFF;  Fuel qualification activities, including fuel design activities;  Irradiation services activities, including reactor core design, the identification and design of required reactor facility modifications, and submittal of license amendment documentation;  Design of MOX Fresh Fuel Transportation Package and obtaining a Certificate of Compliance from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the package;  Managerial and technical integration of all contract activities. The scope of Option 1 will include the following:  Construction management services to include procurement and management of all construction sub-contracts, procurement and installation of facility equipment, and Title III engineering;  Functional check-out and cold start-up of the MFFF;  Defense of required Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensing applications for the MFFF and mission reactors;  Performing required facility modification's to the mission reactors;  Procurement of fresh MOX fuel assembly shipping packages;  Managerial and technical integration of all contract activities. The selection of DCS for award of the base contract and the three options was the result of a competitive selection process involving a source selection board.  The solicitation required prospective Offerors to provide an integrated technical approach to MOX fuel fabrication, qualification, irradiation, and transportation in a manner similar to standard practices in the commercial nuclear industry.  By their nature, each of these technical elements is inextricably tied to the others.  The source selection board determined that the technical approach proposed by DCS would result in the lowest cost and least risk method to meet the commitments of the Surplus Plutonium Disposition Program. The proposal submitted by DCS included the application of certain limited rights data, owed by the partner companies and subcontractors, in the performance of the contract statement of work.  Because the work products developed during the Base portion of the contract are integral to the performance of Option 1 activities, so are the limited rights data provided by the DCS partners and subcontractors integral to the performance of Option 1. Any alternative technical approach to perform the Option 1 statement of work would require DOE to duplicate a significant portion, if not all of the contract costs incurred to date for the implementation of an alternate technical approach. Therefore, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies/services will satisfy agency requirements", it has been determined that DCS is the sole designer, licensee, and construction manager of the MFFF, defender of NRC licensing documents for the MFFF and mission reactors, constructor of modifications to mission reactors, and purchaser of fresh MOX fuel assembly shipping packages.  As such this option will be negotiated on a sole source basis with DCS.  It is anticipated that a performance based Cost Plus Incentive Fee Option with a period of performance from date of exercise through March 2007 will be awarded.  Performance will take place primarily in Charlotte, NC, Aiken, SC, and France.  Though this option will be negotiated on a sole source basis with DCS, all responsible sources who believe they can perform the efforts described herein may submit a proposal detailing their capabilities which will be considered by the agency. Such capability statements may be faxed to Mr. David Hess at (630) 252-5045.

<DESC>The Library of Congress solicitation LC08R7500 is for the FEDLINK Books and Library Publications Acquisitions Program.  This Request for Proposals (RFP) is for  services from vendors who can supply books and library publications (non-serial publications) and associated acquisition support services to federal libraries, information centers, and other federal offices. The services of serials subscription agents and the acquisition of commercial online electronic resources are covered under separate LC/FEDLINK contracts and are not the subject of this solicitation.  The RFP is divided into four lots which define four different but related aspects of books and library publications acquisitions: LOT 1 - Firm Order  Services; LOT 2 - Approval Plan Services; LOT 3 - Leasing Plan Service; and LOT 4 - Technical and/or Order Processing Services.  LOT 1 is the core of this solicitation ? VENDORS MUST QUALIFY UNDER LOT 1 IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SERVICES UNDER OTHER LOTS.   LOT 1  Firm Order Services covers firm orders; a one-time order for a specific title (or specific titles) and number of copies, in contrast to a subscription or standing order.   Under LOT 2, -- Approval Plans, a vendor automatically supplies materials potentially required by a library as they are published, based on a detailed profile of the library's collection needs.  The library may return any publications deemed unsuitable for addition to the collection and is only billed for items retained.  Under LOT 3, -- Leasing Plan Services, the customer leases publications from the supplier instead of buying them and retains an option to purchase leased  items at a reduced price when the term of the lease is over.   Under LOT 4 --  Technical and/or Order Processing Services, the vendor may provide technical processing for materials supplied under this solicitation, performing physical processing or cataloging in order to supply materials to the customer in shelf-ready condition.  The vendor may provide a computer-based order processing system for the customer to make the acquisitions control process more efficient.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  NO TELEPHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED. Vendors are responsible for ensuring that all RFP amendments are received prior to submittal of proposals.  Please check this site periodically for amendments or clarifications to the RFP.   All proposals must be submitted as specified in the solicitation.   For information about the Library of Congress FEDLINK Program, please visit our website at www.loc.gov/flicc.

In previous work as a Special Volunteer at NIA, she has been involved in the characterization of stress-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in cell lines engineered to be deficient in PINK1.  This work is currently in preparation as a manuscript for publication in 2007.  Ms. Sandebring is familiar with protocols involved in this project and therefore is highly qualified for this project.  The period of performance is 9 months.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) is 541990 and the size standard is $6.5 million.  This acquisition is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR, Part 6, Competition Requirements.

Text of clauses may be found at the following websites: www.arnet.gov/far;  www.dtic.mil/dfars.   NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (Apr 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the fleet. (b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier's past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of the Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs).   (c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance - Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999), will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government.   ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE-NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the Fleet. (b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government. The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).   (c) To assist in source selection a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier's quote having a red or yellow classification for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved; suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers who past performance data in the RYG data for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price related factors (e.g., transportation charges, f!  irst article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier's FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revised performance data becomes available.   (d)  RYG classifications are summarized as follows: 	(1)  Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed. 	(2)  Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assuring actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs. 	(3)  Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs. 	(4)  Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery. (e)  RYG classifications for all applicable FSC(s) are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NSLC) Portsmouth Detachment, Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth NH  03801-3884, telephone number 603-431-9460, ext 464, FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, a written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NSLC at the above address.  The request must include the requester's name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity  (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NSLC will provide each supplier, at no charge, an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing their individual data. REQUIREMENTS FOR ACCESS TO NNSY Contractors? representatives must be United States citizens. Representatives are to provide the NNSY Security Office proof of U.S. citizenship (i.e. DHS I-9 FORM. ?Employee Eligibility Verification Form?). The I-9 is based on presentation of appropriate documentation that both verifies the employee?s eligibility for employment and denotes his citizenship status. Contractors can go to http://www.nnsy1.navy.mil/Secutity/docs/i-9.pdf to acquire the required form and completion guidance. NOTE: (1)	The I-9 must be provided before a badge will be issued for unclassified contract work, for access to the shipyard. (2)	If the contract requires access to classified material, a visit request identifying the employee?s clearance status may suffice depending on the employee?s status within the JPAS database. (3)	In the case of contractor truck drivers, knowing some are owner operators, if they are carrying proof of citizenship they can be issued a badge for access to drop off/pick up material. (4)	If the truck driver does not have sufficient documentation and the sponsor is willing to escort the driver to/from the desired location, a by-escort badge may be issued. VENDORS/CONTRACTORS SHALL FORWARD ALL VISIT REQUESTS ON THEIR COMPANY LETTERHEAD SIGNED BY AN AUTHORIZED COMPANY OFFICER. Vendors/contractors shall provide FULL name, FULL SSN, Date of Birth, Place of Birth and a specific statement attesting that the person(s) for whom they are requesting access are citizens of the United States. By so stating, the vendor/contractor is certifying that they have positive documentation of that person?s citizenship on file (i.e. a signed and verified EEVF I-9 form). The request shall also state the specific reason for the visit request and the specific date(s) for which they are requesting access to Norfolk Naval Shipyard (i.e., date of delivery). Material Shipments: Upon completion of the above documentation, vendors/contractors shall fax the letter to the Material Division (phone: 757-396-3141 and fax: 757-396-1029). Service contractor: Upon completion of the above documentation, vendors/contractors shall fax the letter to Technical Point of Contact listed in the contract. IF THE PERSON FOR WHOM THE VENDOR/CONTRACTOR IS REQUESTING A BADGE WAS BORN IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY, THAT PERSON SHALL BRING POSITIVE DOCUMENTATION OF UNITED STATES CITIZENSHIP TO THE NORFOLK NAVAL SHIPYARD PASS OFFICE IN ADDITION TO THE COMPANY LETTER. The additional documentation can be a birth certificate, passport or other official military documentation of United States citizenship.

If the person for whom the vendor/contractor is requesting a badge is a naturalized United States citizen, that person SHALL BRING THEIR ORIGINAL NATURALIZATION papers with them to the pass office in addition to the aforementioned company letter. Once presented, it will be entered in the database and be available for future use so this step will not be required to be repeated. 		******* End of Combined Synopsis/Solicitation ********

The system will be used for motion tracking and full-field measurements to support the Orion Project Landing and Descent Decelerator Earth Recovery System - Advanced Development Project (LaDDERS-ADP).	The Orion landing system must be designed to provide for a safe return of the crew and enable the capsule to be re-used.	The majority of the design assessments on LaDDERS-ADP will be performed with detailed finite element simulations.  The final element models must be validated by comparison with test data.	The ability to provide quick turn-around of quantitative position and velocity values (motion tracking) and structural shape, displacement, and strains is imperative to assessing the predictive accuracy of the finite element models.	This acquisition consists of the following specifications for a photogrammetry system for large-scale, outdoor, high-speed motion tracking applications.	     - Must track 3-D motion of 20 circular targets of 4" diameter      - Within a 50-ft field of view     - For an outdoor application with variations in daytime lighting conditions     - Accept 2000 color or black-and-white camera images from Phantom cameras     - Lens distortion correction and two-camera calibration     - Scripting program for customizing data extraction, output, and graphing     - Provide data turn-around within 1 day of test     - Computer system capable of performing acquisition and reduction of linear and angular displacement and velocity data.     - The photogrammetry project files must also be directly compatible with the PONTOS and ARAMIS systems at NASA Glenn and NASA Johnson for data exchange and analysis by collaborating personnel at those Centers. This acquisition also consists of the following specifications for a photogrammetry system for large-scale, outdoor, high-speed applications.       - Must track full-field 3-D structural shape/deformation/strain motion of Orion-type test articles, such as full-scale airbags     - for an outdoor application with variations in daytime lighting conditions and shadowing     - Accept 2000 color or black-and-white camera images     - Correct for rigid body motion     - Lens distortion correction and two-camera calibration     - Scripting program for customizing data extraction, output, and graphing     - Provide data turn-around within 1 day of test     - The photogrammetry project files must also be directly compatible with the PONTOS and ARAMIS systems at NASA Glenn and NASA Johnson for data exchange and analysis by collaborating personnel at those Centers. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Trilion Quality Systems, who is the sole distributor of PONTOS and ARAMIS software products.  PONTOS and ARAMIS products are required because they have undergone extensive field validation testing specific to the LaDDERS-ADP and no substitute equipment is allowed without prior approval and testing.  Because the LaDDERS-ADP project files must be compatible with PONTOS and ARAMIS systems at other NASA Centers, additional testing of other equipment would not be cost effective. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 24 January 2008.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health (NIH) anticipates awarding a contract to an organization to serve as a Repository for biospecimens and environmental samples for the National Children's Study (NCS) for the requirement described below in this announcement.  The contract type will be 1 (one) cost reimbursement, completion, with a 5 (five) year base and 2 (two) 1 (one) year option periods of performance.  More details will appear in the Request for Proposals (RFP) to be issued in approximately 2 to 4 weeks after the date of the publication of this announcement.  This announcement is intended to inform interested offerors of a planned RFP, of important background information, and of some key requirements essential for responding to the RFP.

Background information on the Study is available on the NCS web site www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov.  The Study is a large, long-term longitudinal study of environmental influences on child health and development.  This Study will explore a broad range of environmental factors that could influence the health and development of children.  For this Study, environment is broadly defined to include biological, chemical, physical, social and behavioral influences on children.  The broad range of outcomes includes obesity, diabetes and physical development; injuries; asthma; pregnancy-related outcomes; and mental health issues.  The Study's goal is to better understand the role of how exposure and genetic factors affect or are associated with children's health, disease and development.   The Study will include a sample of approximately 100,000 children born in the U.S. beginning with early pregnancy or before and following the child for a wide range of health and developmental outcomes and environmental exposures until at least 21 years of age.  More detail about the design and methods for the NCS can be found in the Research Plan on the NCS web site www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov.   

The Repository will be responsible for receipt, secure storage, preparation and distribution of all biological specimens (including but not limited to blood, urine, breast milk, meconium, saliva, hair, nails, buccal cells, placenta, umbilical cord, vaginal swabs and cord blood) that will be collected from participants periodically throughout the Study, and all environmental samples (including but not limited to air sample filters, water, bulk household dust (vacuum and floor wipes), mattress dust, floor mats, food, and soil) that will be collected from households and perhaps other locations periodically throughout the NCS.  Additional samples to be stored in the Repository will consist of prepared ampuled specimens and environmental samples, such as digestates and extracts, residual biological specimens and environmental samples. These specimens and samples are considered precious national resources such that their handling, security, and storage must be subject to the most stringent requirements to preserve their identity, quality and integrity. 

The contractor shall perform the following tasks:  (1) receive, secure, catalog, and store all NCS specimens, samples and records submitted by NCS study centers or analytical laboratories; (2) maintain specimens, samples, and records in appropriate secure storage facilities that will retain their identity, integrity and quality, even in the event of a natural or man-made disaster; (3) prepare, aliquot, and package biological specimens and environmental samples for subsequent analysis; (4) provide shipping materials, shipping services, and technical assistance to ship specimens and samples to laboratories for analysis; (5) develop and maintain a quality assurance program for all Repository operations including personnel management and specimen and sample receipt, shipment, and storage according to all Federal, State, and local regulations, and (6) develop and maintain an automated electronic tracking system to receive, inventory, process, and track specimens and samples that is compatible with the NCS Information Management System. 

To serve as a Repository for the Study, interested offerors must have:

i.	Extensive experience managing large biological and environmental sample repositories.  
ii.	Experience in receiving, processing, storing, and archiving biological specimens (such as blood, urine, hair, nails, buccal cells, breast milk, meconium, cord blood, umbilical cords, and tissues such as placenta) under biosafety level 2 (BSL 2) conditions.
iii.	Experience in receiving, processing, storing, and archiving environmental samples such as soil samples, air sampling filters, water, bulk household dust, prepared samples (ampulated extracts) and special samples (such as floor mats, food). 

The RFP is anticipated to be posted on FedBizOpps (FBO) website:  http://www.fedbizopps.gov, through the NICHD website:  http://www.nichd.nih.gov/funding/grantcontract/, and the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts website:  http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/guide/index.html in approximately 2 to 4 weeks after the date of the publication of this announcement.  The due date for submission of proposals in response to the RFP is anticipated to be on or about April 1, 2008.

Rural Development (RD), Centralized Servicing Center (CSC), USDA, is seeking information/exchange of information for processing Lender place hazard and flood insurance.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) where RD is seeking industry input on the best commercial automated practices for a performance approach to providing Lender-Place hazard and flood insurance.   The information will be used to provide RD with improved understanding of the industry?s automated capabilities and use in future RD planning requirements.  These services include but may not be limited to:

1.	Providing lender-placed fire (single-family, multifamily and condominium), mobile-home, windstorm, errors and omissions or flood insurance coverage for RD borrowers who have either failed to maintain adequate coverage on their property, or are subject to cancellation by their current insurance carrier;

2.	Notifying RD borrowers of the intent to lender-place insurance prior to actual placement;

3.	Providing Standard Flood Zone Determinations on Federal Emergency Management Agency Form 81-93 to field offices nationwide via an internet web page, and maintaining a database of the flood information provided to indicate any changes in the flood zone status over the life of the loan;

4.	Providing access to the contractor?s system through direct line medium for easy reference; and

5.	Providing an on-line history of insurance transactions based on critical changes in insurance data received in the daily transmission.

6.	Providing claims management on lender placed properties.

7.	Providing Check printing services.

RD is looking for the best automated approach in providing the above items.
This synopsis should not be construed as a formal request for proposals but rather a request for information under the authority of FAR15.201.  Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted.  Respondents should not construe this synopsis as a commitment, nor will RD pay for the information solicited.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The technical factors as a whole are more important than price.  However, price remains a significant factor in determining the best value.  The technical sub factors are in descending order of importance with past perfor mance and experience most important and more significant than management.  Management is more important than mobilization schedule.  The price sub factors are of equal weight.   Price proposals must be submitted simultaneously with the Technical proposal t o the Contracting Officer in accordance with the RFPs requirements entitled Proposal Requirements and Evaluation Criteria.

<RESPDATE>022708
<ARCHDATE>04272008
<CONTACT>Carol J. Stimmel, 509-527-7207
<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for proposal.  <BR><BR>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District, CENWW-CT, 201 N. 3rd, Walla Walla, WA 99362, intends to issue a sole source contract with the University of Idaho to conduct an a dult behavior and passage study on Chinook and Steelhead during the entire adult fish passage season in 2008.  The statutory authority for permitting other than full and open competition for this requirement, 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(b), and implemented by FAR  6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(B), which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement; and when it is likely that an award to any other source may result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencies requirements. <BR><BR>This work requires highly specialized expertise in adult salmon and steelhead tracking with telemetry to provide information on migration characteristics and survival of adult fish as the y approach and pass Lower Granite Dam.  These services include determining the dam approach paths, movements in the tailrace, ladder entrance approach, duplication of the transition pool study conducted in 2006, and passage of adult spring and fall Chinook  salmon and Steelhead through the adult fish ladders at Lower Granite Dam relative to the fish passage season and environmental conditions affecting passage such as temperature.  The required services also include the analysis and conversion of data for fu rther evaluation and correlation to seasonal, operational, structural and other experimental conditions as defined by the District. <BR><BR>The Lower Granite evaluation requires the ability of a contractor to obtain the necessary Endangered Species Act per mits from NOAA Fisheries to handle adult salmon and steelhead.  If a contractor with no history of handling and tagging adult Columbia and Snake River ESA listed stocks were to apply for an ESA permit, the process would take approximately 6 - 8 months for the permit alone, resulting in the inability to conduct the study in 2008.  This delay is unacceptable and would not meet the needs of the government for this study.   The contract proposed period of performance is for 16 months.  <BR><BR>If there are sour ces who feel they are able to perform the requirement, they must respond by submitting the following information.<BR><BR>"	Provide proof that they hold permits from NOAA Fisheries to handle adult salmon and steelhead.<BR>"	Present verification that they co nducted successful radio telemetry or other similar (e.g. acoustic tag) research on adult salmonids on the mainstem Columbia and/or Snake Rivers in at least 4 of the last 10 years.   Acceptable verification should include at a minimum two letters from past  clients on company/agency letterhead, and/or a minimum of three samples of professional reports describing the contractors data and results that were published in professional journals or accepted by the Corps of Engineers or other salmon management agen cy involved with Columbia or Snake River stocks.      <BR>"	Demonstrate their capability to install and maintain all cables, antennas, or other necessary equipment at Lower Granite Dam and duplicate the location, study design and analysis of the transition  pool study done in the Lower Granite adult fishway in 2006.<BR><BR>The information obtained will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls or facsimile transmissions will be accepte d.  The NAICS code is 541712 with a Size Standard of 500 employees.<BR><BR>Any firm that believes it is capable of satisfying these requirements may contact Ms. Carol Stimmel at 509-527-7207 for information and submission of required documents. This announ cement is based on the best information available and may be subject to future modification. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is not responsible for any costs i ncurred by responding to this notice.  When responding, please state your business size. Please submit all responses by close of business, 4:00 PM, PDT on February 27, 2008.<BR>

Further, the sole awardee and only the sole awardee shall submit its invoice to the government and receive payment from the government.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the CA/CST.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of Network Appliance support for existing SAN equipment at BIMC.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST/II owns and has in use Network Appliance SAN equipment.  As part of CA/CSTs migration from CLASS to eCLASS, CST purchased and installed 4 Storage Area Networks (SANs) from Network Appliances (NetApp).  The support for the hardware expires on 10/31/2007.  The SAN equipment, however, is still in use and is an essential part to CA/CST/II operations.  By extending the support for the equipment, CA can ensure that Network Appliance will provide premium 7x24 hour onsite support.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the services identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. Due to CAs investment and overall satisfaction with the Network Appliance SAN equipment and the service that Network Appliance provides, it would be counter-productive and unnecessarily costly to attempt to identify, acquire, and install new hardware and new services at this time, assuming that an alternative could be found that offers identical functionality and ease of use.  CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue service for the Network Appliance SAN.  Because this service has already been successfully used, CA/CST believes that it is in the Governments best overall interests to procure and use this particular product.<BR><BR>Reposted to add line items 3 and 4, and to update serial numbers in line 2.<BR><BR>

This is a  request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  Responses to  this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to  form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all  expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government is in need of information on potential sources for a  contractor support contract for the B-2 Training System. Responses to this  RFI will support the development of an acquisition strategy for a contract  to supplant the current B-2 TSCLS contract (F33657-98-D-0005). B-2 Training System (TS) Components The B-2 TS provides aircrew, maintenance, and weapons loading training at  Whiteman Air Force Base, MO.  It includes training devices, software,  courseware, academic materials, and support elements (hardware, software,  support equipment, spares, and documentation) necessary to train B-2  aircrews, maintenance personnel, and weapons load crews, and to keep the  system current with the fielded aircraft.  The B-2 Training System  consists of the following: the Aircrew Training System (ATS) consisting of  Weapons System Trainers (WSTs) and Mission Trainers (MTs); the Maintenance  Training System (MTS) consisting of Cockpit Procedures Trainers (CPTs),  which are used for both aircrew and maintenance training, Computerized  Maintenance Training System (CMTS) suites each with six Weapon System  Training Aids (WSTAs), a Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer, a Flight  Control Systems Trainer (FSCT), and a Weapons Loading Trainer.  The B-2  Training System also includes a Training System Support Center (TSSC)  which provides on-site sustaining engineering support activities for the  training system.  There is also a Training System Center (TSC), located at  the contractor?s facility, to handle any software updates to the  maintenance training system. There are 58 devices as follows: Device	                    Number    Location	        Location Weapon System Trainer	    3	      Whiteman AFBMission  Trainer	            2	      Whiteman AFB (1)  Contractor?s Facility (1) Cockpit Procedures Trainer  8	      Whiteman AFB (4)	Contractor?s Facility  (4) Computerized Maintenance Training System                            6	      Whiteman AFB (5)	Contractor?s Facility (1) Weapon System Training Aid 36	      Whiteman AFB (30)	Contractor?s  Facility (6) Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Flight Control System Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Weapons Loader Trainer	    1	      Whiteman AFBTotal  Devices	           58Services Anticipated The anticipated need for the B-2 TS will include: field services for  training systems, academic instruction, training system contractor  logistics support, and concurrency management and software and systems  engineering.  The effort will include work associated with Distributed  Mission Operations (DMO), the Radar Modernization Program (RMP), and the  Extremely High Frequency (EHF) SatCom Program, as well as future efforts  needed to maintain training system concurrency with the jet. DMO For DMO, the B-2 Weapon System Trainers and Mission Trainers will connect  into the DMO Network (DMON) via a portal provided by Northrop Grumman  Mission Systems (NGMS), the DMO Operations and Integration contractor, and  will have to meet the Combat Air Forces (CAF) DMO Interoperability  Standards.  The contractor will be responsible for ensuring that the WST  design achieves and maintains compliance with DMO System Standards as they  evolve. RMP The B-2 RMP modifies the radar system to operate in a different, approved  radar frequency band.  The B-2 RMP does not provide new capability;  however, it is forcing changes to the aircrew and maintenance training  systems. EHF Satellite Communications (SATCOM) The B-2 EHF SATCOM and Computer Upgrade Program provides a secure, command  and control EHF communications system that ensures the interconnectivity  with a survivable communications link in either a nuclear or conventional  combat-stressed environment at all times throughout the mission. The  Training System will have to evolve in step with the changes being made to  the jet. Security Contractors will be required to have a secure facility.  Personnel working  on the B-2 Training System are required to have security clearances. Contract Items Effort for the B-2 Training System is desired to begin 1 January 2009  (immediately after the current contract expires on 31 December 2008). The Government anticipates a 10-year service delivery period. The B-2 Training System will remain at Whiteman Air Force Base, MO, where  it will be operated and maintained under Contractor Support.  The customer  at Whiteman is Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Education and Training  Command (AETC). CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY B-2 Training System Part I.

This is a  request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  Responses to  this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to  form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all  expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government is in need of information on potential sources for a  contractor support contract for the B-2 Training System. Responses to this  RFI will support the development of an acquisition strategy for a contract  to supplant the current B-2 TSCLS contract (F33657-98-D-0005). B-2 Training System (TS) Components The B-2 TS provides aircrew, maintenance, and weapons loading training at  Whiteman Air Force Base, MO.  It includes training devices, software,  courseware, academic materials, and support elements (hardware, software,  support equipment, spares, and documentation) necessary to train B-2  aircrews, maintenance personnel, and weapons load crews, and to keep the  system current with the fielded aircraft.  The B-2 Training System  consists of the following: the Aircrew Training System (ATS) consisting of  Weapons System Trainers (WSTs) and Mission Trainers (MTs); the Maintenance  Training System (MTS) consisting of Cockpit Procedures Trainers (CPTs),  which are used for both aircrew and maintenance training, Computerized  Maintenance Training System (CMTS) suites each with six Weapon System  Training Aids (WSTAs), a Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer, a Flight  Control Systems Trainer (FSCT), and a Weapons Loading Trainer.  The B-2  Training System also includes a Training System Support Center (TSSC)  which provides on-site sustaining engineering support activities for the  training system.  There is also a Training System Center (TSC), located at  the contractor?s facility, to handle any software updates to the  maintenance training system. There are 58 devices as follows: Device	                    Number    Location	        Location Weapon System Trainer	    3	      Whiteman AFBMission  Trainer	            2	      Whiteman AFB (1)  Contractor?s Facility (1) Cockpit Procedures Trainer  8	      Whiteman AFB (4)	Contractor?s Facility  (4) Computerized Maintenance Training System                            6	      Whiteman AFB (5)	Contractor?s Facility (1) Weapon System Training Aid 36	      Whiteman AFB (30)	Contractor?s  Facility (6) Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Flight Control System Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Weapons Loader Trainer	    1	      Whiteman AFBTotal  Devices	           58Services Anticipated The anticipated need for the B-2 TS will include: field services for  training systems, academic instruction, training system contractor  logistics support, and concurrency management and software and systems  engineering.  The effort will include work associated with Distributed  Mission Operations (DMO), the Radar Modernization Program (RMP), and the  Extremely High Frequency (EHF) SatCom Program, as well as future efforts  needed to maintain training system concurrency with the jet. DMO For DMO, the B-2 Weapon System Trainers and Mission Trainers will connect  into the DMO Network (DMON) via a portal provided by Northrop Grumman  Mission Systems (NGMS), the DMO Operations and Integration contractor, and  will have to meet the Combat Air Forces (CAF) DMO Interoperability  Standards.  The contractor will be responsible for ensuring that the WST  design achieves and maintains compliance with DMO System Standards as they  evolve. RMP The B-2 RMP modifies the radar system to operate in a different, approved  radar frequency band.  The B-2 RMP does not provide new capability;  however, it is forcing changes to the aircrew and maintenance training  systems. EHF Satellite Communications (SATCOM) The B-2 EHF SATCOM and Computer Upgrade Program provides a secure, command  and control EHF communications system that ensures the interconnectivity  with a survivable communications link in either a nuclear or conventional  combat-stressed environment at all times throughout the mission. The  Training System will have to evolve in step with the changes being made to  the jet. Security Contractors will be required to have a secure facility.  Personnel working  on the B-2 Training System are required to have security clearances. Contract Items Effort for the B-2 Training System is desired to begin 1 January 2009  (immediately after the current contract expires on 31 December 2008). The Government anticipates a 10-year service delivery period. The B-2 Training System will remain at Whiteman Air Force Base, MO, where  it will be operated and maintained under Contractor Support.  The customer  at Whiteman is Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Education and Training  Command (AETC). CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY B-2 Training System Part I.

How should other incidentals be submitted (eg. Development time, meetings, reporting time, etc.) There should be very little or no cost associated with developmental time due to the fact that the course has been developed.

Please give a detailed break out for those expenses.  

NEW QUESTIONS & ANSWERS -
1. Is there an incumbent who has conducted this program in the past? Yes the incumbent is Dow Management Institute.

NEW QUESTIONS & ANSWERS -
1.  The "Instructions to Vendors" page refers to pages 13-16 of the SOW for information regarding the technical proposal.  However, the RFQ only contains 12 pages, as posted at http://yosemite1.epa.gov/R6/R6W3C2.nsf/RFQNumber/F158FACC6630F056862573BE006EB31C/$File/RFQ-TX-08-00024.pdf?OpenElement 

Question 1:  How can I obtain the complete RFQ?      You have a complete RFQ.  The RFQ is only 12 pages.  The RFQ is asking that you fill in boxes from 13-16.  The SOW instructions are on page 13-16.

2.  The RFQ refers to a "base year" and two "option years".  Option Year 1 is defined in the RFQ as "1 Feb 08 - 31 Jan 2009", and Option Year 2 is defined as "1 Feb 2009 - 31 Jan 2010". 

Question 2:  Please clarify the Base Year and Option Years of the contract   The base year is the first year of the contract and the option year is the second year of the contract if EPA decides to fund the second year.

NEW QUESTIONS & ANSWERS - 
1. I read that there will be 24-30 total participants; is that correct? That is correct.


2. Is the contract for 12 months or 18 months (with option to renew for another year)? The Instructions for Vendors says 12 months, the Statement of Work, pg. 9 says up to 18 months.  The SOW says the program is for 12-18 months.  EPA wanted to give the vendor the flexibility to be able to complete the training in that time frame.  The current LDP training is scheduled for 18 months.  The problem with a 12 month schedule that it does not give the participants enough flexibility to absorb the material and to engage tin special projects which are part of the course.   

3. On page four of the Instructions for Vendors, I read ?Selected contractors will be expected to lead the training that was developed for the LDP that was conducted in 2007.? What is this?  Dow Management Institute developed a leadership development program in 2007.  Vendors who are awarded the contract will use that curriculum and may add their own material or make modifications to the existing material to enhance the training course.    


4. What is the ?Executive Core Qualifications? mentioned on page four?  The Executive Core Qualifications (ECQs) define the competencies needed to build a federal corporate culture that drives for results, serves customers, and builds successful teams and coalitions within and outside the organization. The Executive Core Qualifications are required for entry to the Senior Executive Service and are used by many departments and agencies in selection, performance management, and leadership development for management and executive positions.
5. Please explain the statement on page nine regarding ?contractor may be required to work more than 40 hours per week.  In some of the training sessions there are some class room activities that take place outside of the normal training hours of 8 am?5 pm. For example group discussions, special activity such as leadership building exercises and watching movies on leadership and evaluating the e the movie.  Other activity may require the contractor to meet with individuals and give them feedback on their performance in class.  

? Will the contractor be asked to work normal office hours or is the essence of the contract a series of training weeks (pg. 40)?  Generally the contractor will be required to work some hours beyond 40 hours, especially during the first training week and the last training week.  For the most part there will be 5 training weeks spread out over 12-18 months.  Training days will start at 8 am and end by 5 pm.

NEW QUESTIONS & ANSWERS -
1. The SOW mentions that the LDP Participants ?will be divided up into three teams or more and will work on team projects that are a direct benefit to the Agency or our stakeholders.? Is this part of the LDP requirements for the selected contractor to coordinate?  EPA will be responsible for dividing up the participants into three teams.    The selected contractor will help the participants coordinate and monitor their progress on their team projects.  Senior staff will give the teams ideas for team projects.


2. Part Two of the SOW it indicates the participants will participate in a 12-18 month program (LDP).  Though ?Attachment III and the Table of Deliverable by Task? show the Final Assessment within 200 days of awarding the contract? Please explain as 200 days would be only about 7-months.  This is an error.  The final assessment of participants and final progress report of the LDP shall be completed 30 days after the final training session.

3. Attachment III of the SOW it details ?training curriculum overview? by ?training weeks?? does this mean the training is expected to occur over five separate weeks or does the term ?training weeks? equate to overview themes for the separate modules? The leadership training course is a 5 week training course that is spread out over 12-18 months.   

NEW QUESTIONS & ANSWERS -
 1. Are there one or more past, traditional or incumbent providers, please?  If so, and if you can tell us, who are they please? Dow Management Institute is the current contractor for LDP 1.


2. What level of travel to Dallas would you anticipate for this project - approximately how many visits and for how long?  The contractor will be required to attend at least 2-3 meetings in Dallas to an assessment of the participants. These assessments or meetings will vary from 2-4 hours. The contractor will make at least 5 trips to Dallas to teach the 5 week sessions.  Hours of training range from 8 am ? 5 pm.  There may be occasions where the training may go from 8 am?7 pm. 

3. For the 360 degree survey and other work that requires polling of a large group, is it acceptable to do this over the web as long as it is totally customized and you have your own survey console and online progress monitoring console for management?  EPA will provide the 360 assessment.  The contractor will use the data to help the participants develop a Focused Development Plan (FDP).

4. What length and format is expected for the actual face-to-face delivered training, please? (For example: Two sessions of two days each for 25 participants per session, held offsite at the XYZ Conference Center)  Similarly, are there matching requirements for face-to-face follow-up?  Training week sessions range from 3- 5 days and average 30-40 hours per week.  Face to face sessions or meetings with senior staff will vary from 2-4 hours.

5. Can we access any reports on past efforts in this arena, their results, and analysis of gaps and future needs please?  (If you or colleagues have written any such reports, for example, or given any relevant conference presentations, we would be keen to see them.)  LDP 1 is ongoing.  Data gaps and analysis will be generated at the completion of the course.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to RFQ-TX-08-00024 is to post answers to questions submitted. The close date for this RFQ is 01/18/2008, 2:00PM, CST.   

1. I read that there will be 24-30 total participants; is that correct? That is correct.


2. Is the contract for 12 months or 18 months (with option to renew for another year)? The Instructions for Vendors says 12 months, the Statement of Work, pg. 9 says up to 18 months.  The SOW says the program is for 12-18 months.  EPA wanted to give the vendor the flexibility to be able to complete the training in that time frame.  The current LDP training is scheduled for 18 months.  The problem with a 12 month schedule that it does not give the participants enough flexibility to absorb the material and to engage tin special projects which are part of the course.   

3. On page four of the Instructions for Vendors, I read ?Selected contractors will be expected to lead the training that was developed for the LDP that was conducted in 2007.? What is this?  Dow Management Institute developed a leadership development program in 2007.  Vendors who are awarded the contract will use that curriculum and may add their own material or make modifications to the existing material to enhance the training course.    


4. What is the ?Executive Core Qualifications? mentioned on page four?

For the most part there will be 5 training weeks spread out over 12-18 months.  Training days will start at 8 am and end by 5 pm.

6. It seems that the proposal is asking for a fixed price (Instructions to Vendors, cover page). On page 14 of the Statement of Work, it asks for ?a labor-hour quote with a ceiling price for this requirement.? Please explain. Contractor shall submit their costs for each training session as well as travel expenses and give a total cost for the training. 

7. On page 13, what is the ?Representative Sample of LDP Curriculum and Guides/Manuals? Representative sample refers to a leadership development program that your company developed and implemented.   


8. Should I submit two copies (pg. 16, Statement of Work) or five copies (cover page of Instructions to Vendors)? Please submit 5 copies.

NEW QUESTIONS & ANSWERS - 
1. I have a question regarding the solicitation for the Leadership Development Program for Managers.  I'd like to confirm that the vendor will be training on the material that was developed for the program last year, as opposed as furnishing other material that the vendor uses.  I'm confused about this because I'm not sure how a potential vendor would get familiar with the material developed last year.  Am I misunderstanding?  No there is no misunderstanding, you are correct that the vendor will be training on the material that was developed for the current LDP.  That is why we ask the vendors to furnish a copy of their leadership development program that they have developed so that we can compare the training with the current training we have in place.  EPA will allow for some modification of the existing training so that the vendor?s training program can compliment or enhance the training that is in place. 
 
NEW QUESTION & ANSWER -
1.   Since the RFP states the need to use the same program content as used in 2007, when will that content be available so that it can be integrated into a 2008 program?  The incumbent is in the process of putting the material together.  We hope to have the material ready for the selected contractor within the next few months.

2.  Are there instructor guides prepared already of the material that was delivered in 2007? As stated earlier the incumbent is in the process of putting that material together.

3.  Is there a desire to keep the 2007 program in tack and in the same order as delivered in 2007 or can modules be moved around to accommodate the competencies identified for the 2008 participants in their initial 360 assessments?  Our goal is to work with existing material and make modifications to the training course if the contractor has material that can enhance the training.  

4.   What 360 tool will be used?  EPA will provide the 360 assessment.  The contractor will use the data to help the participants develop a Focused Development Plan (FDP).

5.  If there is already a 360 tool to be used, does it adequately measure the 20 + competencies and demonstration of leadership values stated in the RFP?  Yes there is a 360 tool be used in house by the Agency.  The 360 tool measure the competencies called Stockcar: Service, Taking Initiative, Open Communication, Commitment (Vision and Values), Knowledge, Character, Accountability, Risk Taking and Innovation.

6.  Is there feedback available on participant satisfaction and course effectiveness of the 2007 program?  The incumbent has completed 4 training sessions and the final training session is scheduled to be completed in March 2008.  All of the training sessions have received evaluations above 4.0 on a 5.0 scale.

7.   Will there be an expectation of # of classroom hours in the 12 month program to be completed?  Generally the contractor will be required to work some hours beyond 40 hours, especially during the first training week and the last training week.  For the most part there will be 5 training weeks spread out over 12-18 months.  Training days will start at 8 am and end by 5 pm.

8.   Does the program expectation allow for breakout modules so that participants who are assessed as lacking in specific competencies may take the modules that address those competencies and reap the benefits of focused training?  Generally that will be discovered during the initial assessment of the candidate?s FDP and reviewing their assessment survey and their 360 survey.  Breakout modules should cover a variety of competencies to address the entire class.

9.  Are there modules developed to teach the agency specific aspects of leadership outlined in the Scope of Work- specifically, HR Management (PARs & EEO) and Entrepreneurship & Vision- (300 Day Plan, Eco Region)?  As stated in the SOW these are subject areas that we expect the contractor to be experienced with.  There have been no modules in LDP 1 developed to teach these objectives.  

10.   What were the lessons learned and course improvements identified as a result of the 2007 LDP?  LDP 1 is ongoing.  Data gaps, lessons learn and analysis will be generated at the completion of the course in March 2008.

<DESC>The U. S. Geological Survey, Water Resources Division, has a requirement for a Hach Nitratax System (Nitratax, Clear 5 mm system) for measuring nitrate concentrations in streams in Iowa.  Due to the high concentrations of nitrate experienced in Iowa streams, the system must be able to measure nitrate concentrations and interface with existing U.S. Geological Survey equipment to record these data.  The system must be an optical system for measuring nitrate concentrations and be compatible with existing Hach equipment.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the services specified as a sole source from Hach Company, P. O. Box 608, Loveland, CO, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and such other materials, which correspond to the required items stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such document without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice to the procurement.

Scope:
The U.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (USDOT/NHTSA) Office of Behavioral Safety Research (OBSR) conducts research and evaluation projects dealing with behaviors and attitudes in highway safety. Program focus is on drivers, passengers, pedestrians, and motorcyclists. 
The OBSR intends to award a contract to conduct a nationally representative random digit dial (RDD) survey to examine the attitudes and behaviors on speed-related issues among drivers age 16 years and older to an approximate sample size of 4,000 landline respondents. The purpose of this study is to further NHTSA's understanding of factors which influence drivers speeding behavior. Major components of this study will be to develop a speed-related survey instrument, to apply survey methods designed to achieve a high response rate and to minimize biases, to conduct a separate sub-study to interview cell phone only respondents, and to conduct data analyses to obtain the following information: 
	extent to which drivers speed;
        who the speeders are (i.e. demographics, typology of    
        speeders)
        where  and when drivers speed;
        attitudes and perceptions about speeding;
        motivation and reasoning for speeding;
        attitudes and knowledge regarding current and future
        speed countermeasures;
        extent of changes in speeding attitudes and behaviors
        that have occurred since the administration of the prior
        2002 and 1997  surveys; 
        predict factors leading to speeding behavior; and
        differences between cell phone only and landline
        respondents in attitudes, behaviors, and demographics.

<DESC>A.       General Information

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.  The purpose of this sources sought notice is to communicate with industry in advance, receive a feed back from the industry, find the interested vendors to foster competition, and use the information gained from this notice to the expected solicitation in a way which benefits both the Government and the contractor.  Please contact POC below for more details.  

B.       Products & Performance Required

Overview: Design, construct and install a moveable deck level bulkhead for a six  lane 50 meter L shaped pool.  The bulkhead will be used in the 50 meter competitive/lap swimming area of the pool.  The bulkhead is used to separate the pool into two sections: a Federation Internationale de Natation (FINA) sanctioned 25 meter course; an approximately 25-26 yard (non-sanctioned) course. 

1.  The bulkhead must be movable from a 25 meter mark at pool?s midway point and transit to the pool?s deep-end wall to allow a 50 yard course.  The bulkhead WILL NOT run from the pool?s midway point to the shallow end.  The bulkhead will have variable buoyancy to lessen weight during movement for easy repositioning.

2.  The bulkhead will be supplied with rails to push the bulkhead into position for locking/resting in place.  A removable stainless steel safety railing with sleeves at  installation points will be provided along the non-competitive side of the bulkhead to protect those persons on the bulkhead from stepping off backwards.
  
3.  The bulkhead needs to submerge when a full 50 meter course in needed.  The bulkhead should be able to re-float in less than 30 minutes from full submersion in the 11 feet depth of the pool.

4. The bulkhead must be able to separate into two movable sections.  Each section, when separated) would equal three lane widths (approximately 27 feet long).  The two sections need to interlock for positive connection when the requirement demands that a bulkhead extends the full width of the pool.  When the bulkhead sections are separated a locking/anchoring mechanism will be employed to keep the free ends from moving. 

5.  The bulkhead will have a complete flow-through design for wave absorption.

6.  The bulkhead will be made of special grade 304L and 316L stainless steel and have a certified slip-resistant grating on the bulkhead?s top and side surfaces for safety.  The exterior cladding will be of an exterior grade PVC composite compound with an integrally machined surfacing that is ASTM 1028C slip resistant certified.  

7.  The bulkhead will be designed to eliminate entrapments from sides and underneath.  Between the bulkhead on pool wall, a side tolerance of not more than 5/16 of an inch are required to keep hands and feet from entrapment or pinning.  An adjustable skirt below the bulkhead is required when there is a depth of water 24 inches or less to prohibit swimming beneath the bulkhead.  

8.  The bulkhead will be designed to accommodate competitive racing lane lines for  both the 25 meter and 26 yard courses.  

9. The bulkhead will include competitive starting blocks supplied by the contractor for six lanes facing the 25 meter course.  

10.  FINA approved wall targets will be applied to the turning surfaces of both sides of the bulkhead. 

11.  The bulkhead will be designed with integral cable tray to easily accept the Natatorium?s electronic timing system touch pads and to run all necessary cabling to connect the timing system for competitive events.  

12.  The designer will furnish all material, equipment, supervision, insurance, and other items necessary to provide a complete working bulkhead system.

13.  All design drawing and specifications shall be submitted under the seal of a registered professional engineer for approval by the base civil engineer (BCE) architects.

14.  The designer will coordinate all phases of the design and installation with the BCE. 

15.  The designer provides a ten (10) year Manufactures Warranty against defects in materials or workmanship for all components of the bulkhead.  The stainless steel truss will be warranted for a period of fifteen (15) years.   

C.       Instructions to Interested Vendors

1.  By going through the Government?s requirement specified above, interested vendors may e-mail the company?s name, e-mail address and phone number, past performance information for the same or similar products and homepage address so that we can include the company in our mailing list when RFQ is issued.  

2.  The Government welcomes any comment from the industry on the requirement above so that we can tailor our requirement better.  For example, a vendor may criticize the requirement from safety prospective, or suggest a trend of the industry, or suggest the alternative such as other than stainless steel.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH - This notice is being published to determine the availability of small businesses that are interested, fully qualified and available during the Mandatory Availability Period (MAP) to perform the work outlined above.

The Forest Service intends to solicit proposals for exclusive use flight services, fully contractor operated and maintained, under the direction and control of the Forest Service (see pre-solicitation notice AG-0109-S-08-0005).  The need consists of one Type III, single engine, 4-7 passenger, pop-out float equipped helicopter.  The Forest Service anticipates locating the base in Juneau, Alaska.  Temporary alternate bases throughout Southeast and South-central Alaska may be assigned.  The mandatory availability period of performance for the base period is June 15 through September 15, 2008.

The helicopter will be used to support maintenance of mountain-top radio repeater sites on the Tongass and Chugach National Forests in Southeast and South-central Alaska.  The typical repeater site would require a pinnacle approach to a peak as high as 5,500 feet MSL.  It may also be used occasionally for the administration and protection of Public Lands.  During the Mandatory Availability Period and any extensions thereof, the aircraft will be made available for the exclusive use of the Government.  The Contractor will be required to be certificated under 14 CFR, Parts 133, 137 and 135, Air Taxi Operators & Commercial Operators for the category and class of helicopter required under the contract.  The term of the contract will be one year with options to renew for two additional years.  Due to the mobile nature of this mission, the contractor shall be prepared to purchase fuel from commercial aviation fuel vendors through-out Southeast and South-Central Alaska.

Qualified small businesses that intend to participate in this acquisition are asked provide relative information that they meet or exceed the above requirements - including availability during the MAP - to the following e-mail address, no later than January 17, 2008 at 2:00 p.m. AST:

Mari Meiners
Contract Specialist
mmeiners@fs.fed.us

In addition, interested parties are requested to provide daily availability and hourly rate cost estimates for the base period of June - September, 2008.     

The submission of information and/or cost estimates does not obligate the Government to purchase, or the interested parties to furnish any helicopters, as the market research and the cost estimates are for planning purposes only.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. The purpose of the sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifications (i.e., HUBZone 8(a), 8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-owned, Veteran-Owned, and Small Disadvantaged Business) relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate determinations about potential sources only. Additionally, a draft Statement of Work is provided for industry comment.

Project Title: 2010-2011 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). 

Project Description: The purpose of the NSDUH is to provide current data on substance use and mental health prevalence for the U.S. population (aged 12 and older) and each state, and to issue reports on survey results. The survey sample will support annual estimates of prevalence for the nation, the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The contractor will be required to: (1) provide sufficient numbers of interviewers and interviewer supervisory staff to screen approximately 175,000 dwelling units and conduct 64,125 interviews per survey year, using computer-assisted interviewing technology; (2) develop training procedures/materials and conduct training classes in order to maintain a sufficient, qualified field staff and satisfy survey fieldwork goals; (3) use statistical expertise to (a) employ a 50-state sample design, with an independent, multi-stage area sample for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, and (b) employ small area estimation techniques in order to develop model-based state estimates; and (4) perform technical writing, analysis, and methodological studies to complete and support the contract tasking. The NSDUH contract will also include a Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS). The purpose of the MHSS is to generate a mental health module for NSDUH that can provide accurate estimates of the prevalence of serious mental illness (SMI) among adults (aged 18 or older) at National and State levels. Data collected from an annual follow-up sample of 500 NSDUH respondents will be used to calibrate the NSDUH mental health screening scales if necessary.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
(RFI)
Technical Media Analysis Tool

This Request for Information (RFI) is for a Technical Media Analysis Tool that will identify an attacker or the electronic address from where an attach is generated, support damage assessment, provide attack characterization that will support mitigation efforts and provide forensic data for use in the pursuit of legal action as warranted.  Responses are due by Close of Business Feb 11, 2008 and should address the following:

1.0	SUBJECT 

This document is a Request for Information (RFI) for a Technical Media Analysis Tool (TMAT) that can be deployed on selected host machines across the Department of Defense (DoD).  Throughout the DoD, within the realm of military command, control, communications, computers and intelligence; the collection, exploitation and protection of sensitive information is critical.  While methods have proven effective at countering identifiable threats originating from outside as well as inside network boundaries, a gap in capability that characterizes a cyber attack and attributes the source of a cyber attack has been identified, exposing the DODs vulnerability across the global infrastructure.  This capability gap of  Attribution and Response Action could adversely impact not only regional operations but potentially global operations and systems that support the warfighter. Historically, there has been less emphasis on the Attribution and Response Action to cyber attacks. Cyber-threats to the Global Information Grid (GIG) may vary significantly depending on an adversarys intent, technological capability and level of knowledge.  Attacks launched from outside the enclave are increasing in frequency and currently the vast majority of protection and detection measures employed by both government and industry are focused at preventing external network attacks.  However, there is an equal or potentially more damaging threat posed by those who have access to information systems and networks, and operate from within a network. 

With regard to a TMAT capability, the targeted sector includes: 1) outside attackers, 2) outside attackers who have found a means to gain access to DOD computer assets and/or networks that are now acting from the inside, and 3) legitimate, authorized internal users.  The primary applications of TMAT will be in the analysis of media to determine the identity of the attacker (the host machine, the individual user(s), the sponsoring state, or group), how the attack was conducted (attack vectors and methodologies), and the attackers intentions.

The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), in support of the Computer Network Defense (CND) mission assigned to the United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), is seeking information from industry, academia, and government that will assist in the acquisition of TMAT capabilities to enhance the CND posture of the DoD computer network systems. The required product is to analyze/examine non-volatile data such as a hard drive or system image (Dead Box), and also Live Box analysis/examination of running systems to acquire volatile data such as network connections and memory contents.

Live Box System:

Under TMAT, solution security products are selectively installed directly on network end points. In general, this means installing agent-based tools on targeted host machines (e.g., workstations, laptops, servers).  In order to be effective across enterprise networks, host-based capabilities must be centrally managed to support installation, monitoring, updating, and configuration.  The following is a description of potential system architecture for a live-box analysis: 

Central Manager: The portion of the solution that provides the central management functionality is called the central manager. The central manager provides centralized installation, management, monitoring, and configuration of the host agent. This central manager primarily will reside within the local enclave but will also have Enterprise remote access.  The central manager should use strong authentication for communication to the host agent over an encrypted session and use ports that are authorized through perimeter firewalls for remote connectivity.

Host Agent: The local host capability to communicate with the central manager is referred as the host-based agent or agent. The capabilities could be provided by either a single agent with multiple modules, the use of multiple agents/modules, or a combination of the two.  The technical media analysis tool should gather user and system information on host machines to include volatile data. 

Dead Box System:

In addition to the enhanced dynamic real-time analysis, there exists a need for off-line, dead-box comprehensive analysis.  Dead-box analysis allows the analyst to conduct a more comprehensive examination to determine the malware utilized in the attack, the methodology of the attack, and possibly a damage assessment of the attack.  Possible analysis would include:

-  Discovery of web sites visited and determination of time spent viewing
-  Recovery of deleted files, emails, and instant messages
-  Analysis of malware methodology
-  Analysis of intrusion methodologies
-  String searches
-  Password cracking
-  Decrypt encrypted folders, files, and disks
-  Analysis of targets computer and network usage

<CONTACT>Ginny Rice 503 402-2971 ginny.rice@va.gov
<DESC>Description: The Portland VA Medical Center intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with Ethicon Johnson & Johnson for the following requirement: three Gen 04 Harmonic Generator 300, three CRT01 Cart for Harmonic Generator 300, three FSW01 Foot Switch and Cable and HP054 Gray Hand pieces.  The estimated amount of this procurement is $26,778.40. In accordance with FAR part 6.302-2 this procurement is an urgent and compelling requirement for Harmonic Scalpel System for the Ultrasonic dissection and ligation of tissue for the department of surgery of the Operative Care division of the PVAMC.  This device; used by General, Urologic, and Gynecologic Surgeons; is introduced through small diameter cannulas to coagulate and cut tissue in a pressurized, Carbon Dioxide rich, atmosphere, using Ultrasonic energy.  All parts passing through the abdominal wall must be disposable for infection control purposes.  The parts that penetrate the abdominal wall must be available in a wide selection for diameters and angles.  It must use ultrasonic, not Bipolar electrical energy, to perform its functions.  Included in this requirement is: No electricity to be passed through the patient's body, must seal blood vessels up to and including 5mm and must seal lymphatic vessels.    It is in the best interest of the government to procure this system to prevent any unsafe surgical infection control issues for the Laparoscopic and minimally invasive surgeries for patient care.  Without immediate procurement safety standards all minimally invasive procedures are compromised and a backlog of patient procedures will increase possible negative outcomes.            A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.        No solicitation will be issued.      Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.            E-Mail any inquiries to:     ginny.rice@va.gov.

DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:  

SEE ATTACHED PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT

Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:    

22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within seven days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR?S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY) 

Xerox is the only company who can provide the supplies and services.  In order to maintain the full service maintenance agreement the copiers must be continuously maintained by Xerox or its authorized representatives under a Xerox express warranty or Xerox Maintenance agreement. Copiers have both hardware and software proprietary to Xerox which must be maintained by Xerox.  

All Xerox copiers have met the Common Criteria accreditation and NIAP certification which meets the government DOD Regulation 5200.28-M. The NIAP certification on this unit is the only COLOR capable multi-function device to enter the certification process. Currently, there are no other devices that have been found to meet our requirements.

Xerox provides for risk of loss or damage.  The Government is relieved from all risk of loss or damage to the equipment during periods of transportation, installation, and during the entire time the equipment is in possession of the Government, except when loss or damage is due to the fault or negligence of the Government. The Government shall assume risk of loss or damage to the equipment during relocation unless the Contractor shall undertake such relocation.

Xerox must be maintained by Xerox or their representative to avoid voiding the total satisfaction guarantee maintenance agreement.

<SUBJECT>65 -- Notice of Intent - Name Brand
<DESC>Date Posted:	01/11/2008
		Closing Date:  01/22/2008


The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy Colorado, intends to award a brand name only commercial purchase order in accordance with FAR Parts 12 & 13.  This notice document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-14, 22 Nov 06.  The North America Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 339114 and the size standard is 500 employees.

The government intends to award a name brand commercial delivery order to Goldbelt Raven LLC, using the existing ARMEC (Army Research Medical Equipment and Consumables) contract. The requirement is to purchase:  
KODAK RVG 6100 SIZE # 2 (3 EA)  P/N: 6100-SEN2-ONLY, 
KODAK RVG 6100 #1 SENSOR (3 EA)  P/N: 6100-SEN1-ONLY, 
RVG 6100 #2 SHEATHS (1 EA)  P/N: 6100-SHEATH-2, and 
RVG 6100 #1 (1 EA)  P/N: 6100 SHEATH-1 

The justification for the brand name requirement is as follows:
Kodak sensors provide digital imagining of dental X-ray?s that can then be globally accessed on the dental digital radiology system (DDRS).  This unique sensor is the cutting edge of technology and improves the efficiency, productivity, and profitability of USAFA dental clinic.  Our requirement is for the sensor that provides an image that is superior to film.

The use of digital radiography will significantly improve the overall quality of care given to our patients.  Film images are instantaneously produced, speeds up clinical diagnosis, decreases patient waiting time, and increases efficiency.  This will eliminate the cost of film and the need for conventional film processing and will decrease chemical hazards (lead & chemistry) as well as hazardous wastes. Kodak is the most versatile integration system on the market with the best image quality.

All responsible sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by 10MSG/LGCB.  This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals.  

Any company that feels they can provide an equal product that meets all the government?s requirements as stated above must submit their technical data (2 pages or less) to support their claim no later than 22 January 2008 at 0800 hour Mountain Time.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis.

<SUBJECT>52 -- Charpy V-Notch Standard Reference Material
<DESC>NOAA's Acquisition & Grants Office, Mountain Region Acquisition Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 15, with MPM Research & Consulting of State College, PA for high quality machining and heat treating services for the production of Charpy V-Notch specimens. 

The sole source determination is based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology?s (NIST) requirement for Charpy V-Notch specimens.  The Charpy V-Notch verification Program contracts for the machining and heat treating of  Super-high Charpy specimens (SRM) 2092, SRM 2096 and SRM 2098 indirect verification specimens.  These SRM's are used to perform indirect verification of Chapy V-notch impact machines for ASTM E23.  A total of 8 to 10 batches of SRM's are produced per year (10,000 to 12,000 specimens).  Based on our market research, MPM Research and Consulting is the only company that can meet the required manufacturing and delivery schedule.  
To control the quality of these SRM's, the contractors used for this work must be qualified according to the NIST Manufacturing Qualification Program Policy.  The variation in impact energy allowed for the specimens is small, and it is difficult to consistently achieve the quality required by the program. 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available.  However, firms that believe they can provide the service that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiation documents in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

<SUBJECT>V -- Armored Courier and Cash Conversion Services
<DESC>To All Armored Courier Services,
 
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is considering pursuing a requirement for Armored Courier and Cash Conversion Services.  Please see our attached Draft Statement of Work (SOW).   We are seeking the best method to take cash receipts from our Taxpayer Assistance Centers (TACs), throughout the United States and have those receipts converted to cashier's checks or money orders and returned to the TACs.  
 
We have some questions about whether or not our SOW reflects standard industry practices and are seeking your input to revise/improve this draft SOW.  Our goal is to create a final document that will form an effective basis for a contract, as well as allow offerors to propose/bid competitively  and in a manner consistent with standard practices.  
 
We anticipate that we will pursue a national contract to meet these needs, and encourage input and participation from firms that serve the entire US now, as well as those that could form a teaming arrangement with other firms to meet this requirement.  
 
We would appreciate it if you could take the time to read the attached Statement of Work and provide suggested additions and/or revisions no later than close of business, January 23, 2008.  Thank you for your interest and assistance in this effort.  Please provide all feedback to:

<SUBJECT>R -- Additional Contractor Support Services
<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk - Philadelphia Division, Contract Operations Branch Mechanicsburg intends to contract with CACI, Incorporated (CACI) of Chantilly, VA for additional contractor support services in support of emergent requirements being experienced by NAVSUP and the Navy Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Program Management Office (PMO).  CACI is currently under contract to provide technical professional support services to NAVSUP, to ensure the successful design, development, test, deployment and sustainment of the Navy ERP Supply and maintenance increments.  These services are performed primarily in Annapolis, MD but may also take place in Mechanicsburg, PA, Philadelphia, PA, Arlington, VA, San Diego CA and Norfolk, VA.  The ramping up of resources for this effort as currently required by NAVSUP headquarters and its field activities over the next year indicates the previously estimated level of support services and its corresponding estimated maximum Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) currently available under the basic Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract will not be sufficient.  As such, additional contractor support services are required in order to meet the higher than anticipated demand for contractor support and to satisfy requirements that are appearing earlier than expected.   Services to be provided as a result of the increased contractor support services include:  participation on integrated product teams within the program, Navy and DoD; assisting the Navy in resolving differences between commercial standards and existing Navy business processes by providing functional expertise in Navy Business Processes, SAP, Advanced Planning, Business Process Analysis; Technical and Functional Architecture Support; User Management and Role Design/Development; Training Development and Execution Support; Organizational Change Management; other Deployment and Sustainment  Support and Sustainment of Legacy Systems.  The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk - Philadelphia Division, Contract Operations Branch Mechanicsburg, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with CACI for this requirement for additional contractor support services.  This firm is considered the only source capable of providing additional services which meet all of the Navy's requirements by February 2008 as they are the current contractor responsible for all contractor-provided ERP Single Supply Support (SSS) services in support of NAVSUP.  In addition, it would not be functionally possible to segregate the additionally required contractor support services from the performance of the existing services.  This can be easily recognized when considering this contract's functional area of training.  It is not feasible to have a different contractor share the same classrooms, lab facilities, and training equipment that is already being used by CACI.  Also, cross training of instructors in other courses already supported by the existing contract is required.  It would not be feasible to cross-train any other contractor's instructors in courses that are covered by current contract requirements.  Further, only CACI can provide the required additional contractor support services having all the unique/relevant skills needed to ensure that there are no unacceptable delays for this critical task.  Interested parties may identify their interest and prove their capability to respond to this requirement for additional services.  This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  However, all information received within forty-five (45) days after date of this notice will be considered by the Government.  Information received as a result of this notice of intent will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government will not pay for information received.

<SUBJECT>D -- Lawful Interception Mediator Architecture
<DESC>This notice is being publicized in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.101 requiring Contracting Officers to disseminate information for proposed contract actions expected to exceed $25,000.  Further in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 it is the intent of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to make award to the Group 2000 Nederland B.V.

The DEA has an immediate need for the lease of a proven lawful interception solution for Nokia GSM Mobile Switching Centers (MSCs) and General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) components without incorporating the use of a Nokia Lawful Interception Gateway (LIG).  

Group 2000?s LIMA lawful interception solution is capable of intercepting circuit switched Interception Related Information (IRI) and Communications Content (CC) as well as packet switched Control Data and Payload Data without the use of an additional Nokia LIG.  Group 2000 has developed a sophisticated proprietary protocol to accomplish the interceptions, perform mediation of the intercepted channels, and provide delivery of the intercepted channels without the need for third party vendors or additional equipment.

As a result Group 2000 Nederland B.V. is the only responsible source to provide the necessary capability to support this DEA communication need.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions.

FMC-90121-07-0007-SOL2 - Questions and Answers (Amendment 4)


What are the minimal educational qualifications for personnel assigned to this effort?
The minimal educational qualifications are a high school diploma, or Certificate of General Educational Development (GED), and some computer training.

What optional components to Laserfiche version 7.2 are you utilizing?  
At the moment the scanning staff does not utilize any of the optional components.

Are the Filenet re-indexing documents currently in Laserfiche without index values?  
Some of the Filenet documents do contain values, but those values will need to be retyped into the Laserfiche template for those particular documents.  When these documents were migrated from Filenet to Laserfiche, some of the Filenet values were transferred to the documents, but for a large portion of the documents those values did not transfer.

Can you describe the scanning equipment workstation to be used?  
Scanner model: Bell Howell; 3600 Truper
PC model and scanner interface type: Dell; SCSI Interface
Scanner software in use: Laserfiche 7.2

Can you provide the former productivity standards? 
Productivity standards were addressed under the present contract through assessments of contractor's timeliness and quality of work on a random sampling basis.  In the upcoming contract, productivity standards will be established to monitor productivity separately.

Does Laserfische 7.2's drag and drop capabilities extend to metadata extraction or does this information require manual data entry?  
Some basic information (metadata) can be dragged/dropped from the document to index fields using Laserfiche.  However, other information (metadata) must be entered manually into the index templates.

Will the Government provide the documentation that provides guidance for evaluating security requirements, as well as the documentation that provides instruction regarding categorizing information in the system?   
This will be explained as part of the orientation and training provided.  The manner in which the file directory is structured provides the necessary security for the documents housed in the system.  Placement of documents in the proper folder ensures that security protocols are met.

Please explain the interface between the FileNet and   Laserfische platforms?  
There is no interface between the two platforms.  Filenet software is no longer used nor is it accessible.  Any documents previously scanned using Filenet were migrated into Laserfiche.
 
How many of the scanners are duplex scanners or 1-sided scanners?  
Both of the scanners are duplex capable scanners.  The majority of the documents scanned are one-sided documents.

Is the backlog comprised of all text files or a combination of text and other media such as photos and video?  
All of the documents in the backlog are text documents.

The statement of work indicates that the contractor will be responsible for demonstrating experience with FileNet. Can you please provide the version of the software?
Filenet version 3.3 

Does the government anticipate that the personnel providing scanning and indexing services also provide the required training identified in the solicitation or is the Training Specialist considered a separate labor category/FTE based upon the training requirements stated in the SOW?

It is not anticipated that a separate labor category/FTE would be used for this task.  The contract staff providing scanning and indexing services will also be responsible for providing guidance, direction, and training to additional contractor staff and/or FMC staff as needed. Training and direction for any additional Contractor staff will include initial orientation and follow-up as needed on: (1) the FMC's business processes as they relate to the document scanning/indexing program; (2) the Laserfiche system's capabilities, functions, and features as they are applied to the FMC's document scanning/indexing program; (3) the wide variety of FMC documents ? imparting guidance on how to decipher and accurately extract pertinent information to be used in the indexing process; (4) acceptable document/scanning product quality and techniques for correcting deficiencies; and (5) responses to other questions relating to the FMC's document scanning/indexing program as needed.  Training and guidance provided to FMC staff by the Contractor will include: (1) assisting OS staff in conducting, as needed, either initial or refresher training to FMC staff on basic Laserfiche system features and capabilities; and (2) responding to questions regarding researching and extracting documents scanned and stored in the FMC's Laserfiche system.

 
Will FMC provide system, software and hardware technical support in the event of operational problems with the Laserfiche system?
Yes

Will the FMC provide a primary POC for interface on a daily basis to support ongoing operations?
Yes

Have the 50,000 documents that must be re-indexed been recovered from the Filenet system and if so how are they currently being maintained and how will the contract access those records?
Yes, the 50,000 documents have been recovered from Filenet and currently are in Laserfiche. These records will be accessed by the contractor through the Laserfiche system.

You stated that the government is providing all hardware, software and facilities.  Could you please give me a list of the brand and number of computers, scanners and servers available for the project?
There are currently two full scanning stations located in the Docket Activity Room of the Secretary's Office.  Each station consists of a computer with Laserfiche 7.2 software and a scanner.  The storage device and server are located and maintained in the Office of Information Technology.
Scanner model: Bell Howell; 3600 Truper
PC model and scanner interface type: Dell; SCSI Interface
Scanner software in use: Laserfiche 7.2

You stated that FMC will provide training on FMC procedures and scanning equipment/software.  Does this include training on the Laserfiche 7.2?
Yes

Will the government please provide a size standard for this Total Hub Zone opportunity?
6.5 million.

What is the labor category / level is intended for this contract based 
on DC's Wage Determination?
It is up to the contractor to interpret the requirement and propose the solution that they feel best meets the needs of the FMC.

What was the length of DSI's contract?
About 4 months.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and written solicitation will not be issued. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is seeking statistical sampling services in the area of Accounts Payable accrual, in accordance with the following Statement of Work: Statement of Work The Contractor will provide all materials, labor and equipment to provide and/or validate a sampling plan, which satisfies the sampling requirement of the Office of the Inspector General and KPMG, in support of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2008 financial statement audit.  The sampling methodology will be determined by the Contractor to provide the smallest sample possible while covering the entire population. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) will accrue a liability amount for FY 2008 based on a three-year historical analysis of actual invoices processed in the accounting system reflecting an invoice date within the first 45 days of the respective fiscal year.  These invoices are examined to determine which FY the goods and services were received.  For example, invoices dated from 10/1/05 to 11/15/05 may represent liabilities for FY 2005 or FY 2006 but were not paid until FY 2006 or later.  In previous years, BIA has worked in conjunction with a Contractor to establish an accepted methodology relating to the Accounts Payable (AP) accrual.  This statement of work defines the work required to build upon the three year trend by sampling the most current fiscal year and combining the results into the methodology.  This work involved shall proceed as follows: ?	The Contractor will be supplied with an electronic file of payments made during FY 2007 no later than January 28th 2008.  Within seven calendar days of receiving the electronic file the Contractor must provide BIA with the stratified sample as consistent with the methodology used in the FY 2006 sample. ?	BIA will then pull the sampled items and review them to determine which fiscal year the goods and services belong.  Results of the BIA review will be submitted to the Contractor no later than noon on March 24th, 2008. The contractor must then merge this data with the data produced in the FY 2007 accrual process to assimilate a complete three fiscal year analysis, culminating with a final projection that will be used in the FY 2008 accrual.  These projection results are due from the Contractor within five calendar days (e.g., if BIA provides results on 3/24 then the Contractor must provide the projection number by 4PM on 3/29). ?	The Contractor must provide a written report describing the sampling approach and results of analysis within seven calendar days after delivering the projected number/error rate.  For example, written report is due 4PM on 4/5 after delivery of AP projected number on 3/29.  The written report must concisely explain methodology, scope and conclusions to allow for subsequent review by BIA management, the OIG, and the external auditors.  Example of a written report is attached. Unless specified otherwise, BIA will send all data files and results of its review to the Contractor electronically via email, FTP, or on CD-rom via overnight mail by 12PM EST of stated deadlines.  All deliverables due from the Contractor must be received by 4PM EST of stated deadlines and must be submitted in soft copies such as Microsoft Excel or Word. During periods of calculation or following the projection the Contractor shall be available for telephone consultation by BIA staff to include a Staff Accountant as well as the Chief of the Financial Reporting and Analysis Division.  These communication sessions may be used to discuss preliminary results, discuss procedural questions, or to provide progress updates. Not to exceed two face-to-face meetings may be requested and would be held at Reston, VA.  The purpose of these meetings would be to discuss the accrual process and/or results and to answer/debrief any questions BIA and KPMG might have.  BIA will provide a minimum of seven calendar days notice regarding the meeting date(s) to allow for travel arraignment by the Contractor.  BIA will reimburse the Contractor for his out-of-pocket travel cost associated with this engagement if such travel should be requested. Except for the out-of-pocket travel costs related to the face-to-face meeting, the Contractor will provide all materials and labor to perform this task at off site.    The period of performance will start upon the final signing of this statement of work and will end on or about April 13th, 2008 following BIA?s acceptance of the Contractor?s written reports.   All firms or individuals responding must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). The SIC Code is 5812; the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334119. The following Provisions and Clauses are incorporated and shall remain in full force in any resulting purchase order. FAR Part 52.212-1 Instruction to Offerors ?
