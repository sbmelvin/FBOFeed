ORIGIN. This part requires engineering source approval by the design control
activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design
capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified
source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The
approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical
data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or
knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate
source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,
as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification
procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having
jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The subject item
requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is
flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined
adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the
source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been
solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that
an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an
approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information
detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source
Approval Information Brochures listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx
Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data
required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the
same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request
for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your
offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source

<p>The 379 ECONS intends to issue a purchase order for a commodity that is capable of providing vehicle and cargo screening while being mobile.

<p>Depending upon the response to this notice and other market research, the 379 ECONS may limit the competition. This announcement serves as the first step for 379 ECONS to determine the viability of competing this requirement or soliciting a sole-source purchase order. This is a sources sought announcement only; no solicitation exists or is available at this time.</p>
