<SUBJECT>Development of Loan Files for Training Purposes
<SOLNBR>2009-DOA-1
<RESPDATE>060209
<CONTACT>E. Lynn Carr-Hawkes, Contracting Officer, Phone 7035622220, Fax 7035622553, Email ecarrhawkes@fdic.gov
<DESC><p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is seeking sources indicating interest in developing and producing 55 paper-based residential real estate, commercial real estate, and commercial loan files that match corresponding loan information in an existing database or fictitious bank policies. This notice is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). This notice may be canceled at any time, and may not result the issuance of an RFP or award of a contract. <br />However, this information will be used to create a list of qualified and interested vendors for a future solicitation. Companies are invited to submit information describing their experience and their capabilities with regard to the requirements listed below.
<p>The loan files will be used to supplement the training program to familiarize employees with the various documents included in a loan file. The paper-based bank loan files must correspond to data in an existing web-based database and must approximate loan files found in a bank. The paper-based loan files combined with the existing database will allow employees to develop skills in a cost-effective, dynamic framework. The employees will need to determine whether all required documents are in the file, locate information in the documents, determine whether the loan terms are in keeping with bank policies, identify deficiencies related to each document, etc. The training will teach employees how to: 1) pool and market loans for sale, 2) value loans, 3) examine loans, and 4) manage loans.</p>
<p>The loan files will need to include approximations of the following: <br />&bull; corresponding loan officer notes<br />&bull; pledged collateral<br />&bull; credit reports<br />&bull; appraisals<br />&bull; environmental reports<br />&bull; tax returns<br />&bull; legal documents<br />&bull; insurance policy<br />&bull; promissory notes<br />&bull; surveys<br />&bull; financial statements<br />&bull; blueprints<br />&bull; loan payment history<br />&bull; security agreements<br />&bull; amortization schedules<br />&bull; loan applications, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Scope of Work:</strong></p>
<p>Corporate University (Corp U) is the training and employee development arm of the FDIC and supports the Corporation's mission and business objectives through high quality, cost effective continuous learning and development. Corp U provides opportunities for employees to enhance their sense of corporate identity while learning more about FDIC's major program areas of supervision, compliance, resolutions and insurance. Corp U leverages technology to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of training FDIC employees. Corp U uses a blended training program to develop, capture, maintain, and transfer essential and mission critical knowledge, skills and abilities for its employees.</p>
<p>The FDIC is committed to using methods and techniques to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of its training programs. The 55 loan files must match corresponding loan information in the existing database and fictitious bank policies. The files will need to be in both electronic and hard copy forms. The electronic files will be archived on a web site to allow for easy accessibility. The hard copy documents will be organized in file folders with tabs and shipped to the FDIC's Dallas, TX office. It is expected that the contractor shall create the forms and documents without referencing actual loan files because of privacy law or recreate an existing loan file with all identifying data changed so it cannot be referenced back to the borrower's actual identify. All financial data will be fictitious as well as the graphics depicted in the loan files.</p>
<p>Financial data for the loan files will be created as electronic files. Most documents needed outside the software suite will be created from scratch, providing only rudimentary data. For example, the appraisal documents will only need to include the: date of the appraisal, appraised value, and appraisal method/approaches. Likewise, an environmental report will only need to indicate: the phase of the report, test date(s), test results, conclusions, and recommendations. Other documents such as a credit report will need to include information sufficient to determine the borrower's credit and employment history. The actual numbers and types of collateral documents will vary considerably, depending on the loan type. The contractor shall determine the contents of and develop the contents for each loan file. All loan files shall be state of Texas loans and conform to the fictitious bank policies as well as the fictitious data keys already developed.</p>
<p>At no cost to the FDIC and to the extent mutually agreeable between the FDIC and participating vendors, demonstrations of loan files may be requested. Demonstration sessions can provide an opportunity for more questions to be answered.</p>
