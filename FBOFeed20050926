<DESC>Contractor will provide document delivery services for a six (6) month period before the standing-up of the Government's Most Efficient Organization (MEO), which is the winning service provider (Woodruff Health Sciences Center Library (WHSCL)) in CDC's Library Services A-76 competition.  Consequently, WHSCL will also be the document delivery services provider through a contractual teaming agreement to be implemented by the MEO; therefore this proposed contract will be a bridge to the MEO by providing document delivery services during the MEO phase-in period.  Based on the above it is in the Government's best interest to award a contract to WHSCL for the interim period document delivery contract.

<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE), National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), intends to negotiate a sole source delivery order with Arch Wireless Operating Company, P.O. Box 660770, Dallas Texas 75266-0770 for continuing pager service in support of the NNSA Service Center, Albuquerque NM. The DOE NNSA has determined that it is more cost-efficient and in the best interest of the governmentâ€™s critical mission to continue pager service with Arch Wireless because of the use of established pager phone numbers which are non-transferable. DOE NNSA intends to negotiate with Arch Wireless Operating Company under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 and no other sources will be considered. This notice satisfies the requirements of FAR Part 5. The estimated value of the base one year period, plus four one-year options, is $1,023,145 and is subject to the availability of funding. Questions pertaining to this planned action may be directed to Leticia Potts, Contract Specialist, at lpotts@doeal.gov.

<DESC>This project shall provide design, permitting, dredging, as well as processing and disposal of dredge spoils to ready the Reserve Basin of the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Office (NISMO) at the Philadelphia Naval Business Center, Philadelphia PA to meet projected numbers and class of ships arriving in 2008 and beyond. The project shall accomplish maintenance and environmental dredging of selected areas of the Reserve Basin to a depth of 30 feet plus 1 foot over depth and also include removal and disposal of contaminated sediments and debris. Historically the Reserve Basin was dredged at 5 to 10 year interval but because of the discovery of contaminated materials limited dredging was done in 1993 and no dredging has been done in the last 12 years. Some berthing areas are now less than 25 feet deep and the entrance channel is less than 17 feet deep in some locations. The 30-foot depth is required to provide for berthing and maneuvering of deep draft ships. Extensive testing has defined contaminated sediments both in the berthing locations and other areas of the Reserve Basin. This project shall dredge and dispose of contaminated sediments and provide the required 30-foot depth for ship berthing. The total amount of dredging to be accomplished is in the range of 400,000 to 650,000 cubic yards. Approximately 25% of the total amount is contaminated and in addition to providing an operational channel, removal of the highly contaminated sediments will serve as a remedial action under the Installation Restoration Program.  The anticipated project cost is in excess of $10,000,000.

This resultant solicitation will be awarded under Best Value Source Selection Procedures based on price and non-price considerations.  Offers will be evaluated on Past Performance of the Dredger, Past Performance of the Environmental & Engineering Support Team, the proposed Operational Plan for the project including such information as the dredging method, the treatment approach, transport and disposal information, permitting and regulatory requirements, schedule of activities as well as proposed personnel, and, finally, Small Business Commitment.  The specific details and weighting of these evaluations will be addressed in the solicitation.

This preliminary notice is provided to encourage interested parties to register for the planned solicitation at the NAVFAC Electronic-Solicitation website at http://www.esol.navfac.navy.mil  This will enable the agency to communicate with and provide relevant information to interested parties prior to formal release of the solicitation, to ensure that offerors have adequate opportunity to explore and develop solutions to accomplish this performance based requirement.  In addition, registration will enable contractors to participate in any pre-solicitation meetings and receive notification of the actual solicitation release.

The projected release date of the solicitation is 13 December 2005.

<DESC>CBD Synopsis Description On or about October 15, 2005, NASA will issue instructions to Lockheed Martin Applied Technology Corporation, Palo Alto, CA and to Assurance Technology Corporation, Carlisle, MA, for Phase 2 (Implementation) of the Space Environment In-Situ Suite (SEISS).  These companies were awarded contracts for Phase 1 (Formulation) under the progressive competition procedures described in NASA FAR Supplement 1817.7300(c) and 1817.7301-5.  While NASA's expectation is that only these Phase 1 contractors will be able to successfully compete for Phase 2, all proposals will be considered.  However, a proposal from any such additional offeror(s) must demonstrate a design maturity equivalent to that of the Phase 1 contractors.  This demonstration must include completion of a Concept Design and the results of completed trade studies, analyses, and demonstrations (fully compliant with Phase 1 Contract Statement of Work).  Failure to fully and completely demonstrate the appropriate level of design maturity may render a proposal unacceptable with no further consideration for contract award.  All of these conditions were disclosed during the full and open competition for Phase 1.  Prior to the release of the instructions to the Phase 1 contractors, certain preliminary documents will be provided for their comment.  Any responsible source may indicate its desire to submit a proposal for the implementation phase.  These documents and the final instructions to the Phase 1 contractors are available to potential additional offerors upon request.  Requests for the preliminary documents or for the final instructions to the Phase 2 contractors must be directed to Clelia Walker, Code 210.7, NASA/GSFC, Greenbelt, MD 20771.  E-Mail: Clelia.A.Walker@nasa.gov, Fax: 301-286-9319. An ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requires an electron beam lithography system for the NIST Advanced Measurement Laboratory (AML) Nanofab.  The e-beam lithography system is to be used for both direct write lithography and mask writing. 

The Contractor is responsible for supplying the lithography system as well as any vibration, acoustic, and electromagnetic isolation required to meet the technical specifications.  

The NIST AML Nanofab will be operated as a shared access user facility.  This means that the staff of NIST and its partners, subject to provisions, training, and user fees, will be permitted to independently operate much of the equipment.  

The e-beam lithography tool being procured will likely have only two certified operators.  The tools will be operated in a manner such that a wide variety of materials can be processed.  The facility will be directed by NIST’s Semiconductor Electronics Division. Unlike other Nanofabs, the NIST AML Nanofab is unique in that it is located next to the most advanced metrology tools in the world, and its focus will be on fabricating nanoscale structures necessary for metrology and standards in support of the semiconductor industry, nanotechnology, biotechnology, and homeland security.  

This requirement is being procured using Simplified Acquisition 
Procedures under the authority of FAR Part 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items via full & open competition.

The NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.

The competitive Request for Quotation (RFQ), specifications, any subsequent amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFQ number 
SB1341-05-Q-0673.

The RFQ is anticipated for release to the vendor community on or about June 7, 2005, and will only be available via the Internet at the above web site.

Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the web site.  Interested parties must respond to the RFQ in order to be considered for award of any resultant purchase order.   No written solicitation document is available, telephone requests shall not be honored, and no bidders list shall be maintained.  Potential offerors are requested to direct all questions via e-mail to Carol.Wood@NIST.Gov.

THE DUE DATE FOR QUOTATIONS SHALL BE IDENTIFIED IN THE SOLICITATION.

<DESC>USTDA is a U.S. Government agency that provides a bridge to U.S. technical know-how and experience for developing and middle income countries. The focus of the agency is unique in that it creates public-private partnerships in response to foreign project sponsor needs and priorities. USTDA funds help identify and prepare projects for implementation that will establish the infrastructure necessary for economies to expand. At the same time, the agency's activities develop trade partnerships by enhancing the ability of U.S. firms to conduct business overseas. The projects supported by USTDA are designed to help countries establish a favorable trading environment and modern infrastructure that promotes sustainable economic development.  To this end, the agency funds overseas project sponsor access to U.S. private sector expertise through a variety of program activities that include: technical assistance and training; definitional missions and desk studies; feasibility and other specialized studies; procurement assistance; outreach activities; orientation visits; and conferences, workshops and training.  The purpose of this Indefinite-Quantity Contract (IQC) is to organize USTDA's Conferences, Workshops, Orientation Visits (OVs), Training and Outreach Activities.  These activities require contractors who are capable of organizing events within a short timeframe, and managing them in a thoroughly professional and smooth operational manner.  The ability to market the events and to solicit participation by appropriate U.S. and foreign firms is very important. Any of these activities can require appropriate supporting documentation, project resource guides, handouts, or audiovisual materials.  The contractor may be required to travel to foreign countries to research and identify projects to be included in the project resource guides.  A typical project resource guide includes information on specific projects discussed at the event, providing a profile of the project, its background, technical and timing status, political/governmental support, and critical personnel for the project.  Examples of briefing books or project resource guides are available, upon request and without cost, from USTDA’s library at 703-875-4357. Orientation Visits (OVs):  Orientation Visits bring foreign project sponsors and decision-makers to the U.S to familiarize them with U.S. firms, equipment, technology and services that can help them achieve their development goals. Conferences and Workshops:  USTDA organizes business conferences and workshops worldwide.  These events are sector or project-oriented and connect overseas project sponsors with U.S. firms and entities that supply project finance, technology and expertise that may be useful in implementing a development project.  USTDA does not fund trade shows or exhibitions. Conferences and workshops allow U.S. company representatives to learn about export opportunities in emerging markets and allow them to meet project sponsors, while building significant business relationships.  Attendees benefit from the training components included on many USTDA conference agendas and receive project resource guides that contain financial, technical and contact details for the showcased projects. Training:  USTDA coordinates and conducts training which covers a broad range of subject matter related to trade capacity building, customs issues, infrastructure, regulatory and policy trends, security and safety issues and new industry technologies, among others. Outreach Activities:  Outreach activities are conducted to acquaint U.S. and foreign business people with the programs and opportunities available through USTDA. 
Supporting Technical Assistance and Documentation:  This may include research for project definition, identification of project sponsors and speakers, preparation of project resource guides, training materials, conference books and other material (such as overheads, electronic presentations and other audiovisual tools) for use during orientation visits, conferences, workshops, training, and outreach activities. Under this IQC, USTDA is seeking contractors who have the ability to organize conferences in any location in the United States or overseas.  Solicitation will be issued on FedBizOpps only and published on or about October 11, 2005.  A pre-proposal conference is tentatively scheduled for October 27, 2005 in the Washington, D.C. area at a location to be announced.  Tentative date for solicitation response date is November 18, 2005 with a tentative contract award date of January 12, 2006. Twenty to 30 contract awards are anticipated to result from the solicitation. Government estimate contract value (per vendor)is not to exceed $1 million annually with a base and four annual options.  Total contract amount per vendor is estimated to be $100 million.  At minimum, thirty percent of the vendors selected shall be small business.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The Tucson Drainage Area Project consists of construction of the Park Avenue Basins.  The four basins include three inline basins called, Basins 1, 2 and 3, and an offline basin called Tucson Unified School District (TUSD) Basin.  Basins 1, 2 and 3 are con nected via drainage structures that pass low flows.  The TUSD Basin includes a weir located in Arroyo Chico Channel at the Railroad Wash confluence.  It will drain through a 36-in pipe into Basin 3.  At the location of the TUSD Basin, the existing athletic  fields and appurtenant facilities will be demolished and new fields will be constructed at the bottom of the basin and a new locker room/classroom/snack bar building, new parking lot, new maintenance building, new field lights, new dug outs, back stops, b atting cage, and built-in bleachers will also be constructed within the basin and its periphery.  The project also consists of modifying the inlet on High School Wash at Park Avenue.  An existing triple box, consisting of a double 7-ft by 4-ft and a single  6-ft by 4-ft RCB crossing Fourth Avenue would be removed and a new double 10-ft by 8-ft RCB would be constructed beneath Fourth Avenue to Eighth Street, where it would confluence with the existing Tucson Arroyo RCB.  Channel modifications consist of over excavating by four feet of an existing channel starting from Parkway Terrace to Campbell Avenue.  The channel would be lined with gunite along the invert and the lower four feet (vertical) of side slopes, and backfilled with soil.  The upper side slopes wo uld be lined with articulated block.  The fully entrenched channel would have a 22-foot bottom width, a depth of 8-feet, and 1:1 side slopes.  The existing dip crossings at Norris, Olsen, and Plummer Avenues would be lowered  to match the new invert elevations.  The Campbell Avenue crossing would replace a four-barreled 4-ft by 10-ft RCB with a six-barreled 4-ft by 12-ft RCB.  An existing sewer line would be relocated in order to maintain the current elevation.  An existing si de drain entering Arroyo Chico under Campbell Avenue will have to be relocated within the new box.  Five grade control structures would be constructed in the unlined channel reaches.  The structures will be constructed of grouted stone, with a top width of  6-feet, a depth of 6-feet, and a downstream 15-foot-long section filled with riprap.  The Los Angeles District subcontracting goals are specific percentages of the contractors total planned subcontract amount. The goals are as follows: 62% with small busi ness, 10% with small disadvantaged business, 10% with woman owned small business, 3% with Veteran owned small business, 3% with severe disabled veteran owned small business and 3% with hub zone small business. All interested contractors are reminded that t he successful contractor will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent with small and disadvantaged firms in accordance with the provisions of Public Law 95-507.

<DESC>GENERAL:  The purpose of this Modification to the Presolicitation Notice HR0011-05-R-0001 issued on 7 SEP 05 is to announce that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Information Resources Directorate (IRD), through the Contracts Management Office (CMO), hereby officially issues Request for Proposals (RFP) No. HR0011-05-R-0001, for “Unclassified” Information Technology (IT) Support and Services.  All qualified and capable sources, consistent with the terms and conditions of the RFP and all associated attachments to the RFP, are encouraged to respond.  NOTE:  Proposers may wish to review this RFP HR0011-05-R-0001 in conjunction with RFP HR0011-05-R-0002.

PROPOSAL DUE DATE:  Proposals are DUE NO LATER THAN 1630 (4:30PM) ON MONDAY, 31 OCT 05, ARLINGTON, VA LOCAL TIME.  However, proposers are requested to submit PAST PERFORMANCE – Volume 2 Information early, no later than 17 OCT 05, consistent with the instructions promulgated in Section L of this RFP. 

PROPOSAL SUBMISSIONS:  DARPA desires one (1) complete electronic copy of an offerors proposal, and one (1) complete paper/hard copy of an offerors proposal.  The electronic submission of PAST PERFORMANCE – Volume 2 information should be completed by offerors by 17 OCT 05, as specified in Section L, with the remaining electronic proposal sections and one (1) complete paper/hard copy of the offerors proposal to include the paper/hard copy of PAST PERFORMANCE – Volume 2, DUE on 31 OCT 05.  Additional proposal related instructions are specifically listed in Section L of the RFP.  Because DARPA desires to receive and evaluate proposal submissions electronically, all offerors MUST register at: http://www.tfims.darpa.mil/rfp one (1) week prior to submitting any proposal related information.  NOTE:  BECAUSE THE PAST PERFORMANCE VOLUME (Volume 2) electronic copy IS REQUESTED EARLY BY DARPA, OFFERORS SHOULD REGISTER AT THE APPROPRIATE WEBSITE NO LATER THAN 07 OCTOBER 2005.  

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD:  The objective of this solicitation is for the government to select the offer that represents the “best value” for award consistent with the contents of this solicitation and the evaluation factors, subfactors, and guidelines specified in Section M of the RFP.  In determining “best value” the government shall use the Tradeoff Process delineated at FAR 15.101-1, whereby the government will consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror.  Therefore, the government will not use the process described in FAR 15.101-2, Lowest price technically acceptable source selection process.  Consistent with the requirement of FAR 15.101-1, the evaluation factors for award, in descending order of importance, are as follows:  (1) Technical Approach, (2) Management Approach, (3) Past Performance, and (4) Cost/Price.  When the first three factors are combined, they are significantly more important than the Cost/Price factor.  Although the three non-cost factors are significantly more important than the Cost/Price factor, the importance of the Cost/Price factor will increase as the non-price factors of the proposal become closer in merit.  The Technical Approach Factor (Factor 1) is further subdivided into two (2) subfactors, and the Management Approach Factor (Factor 2) is further subdivided into four (4) subfactors as further described in Section M of the RFP.

ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:
Proposers are cautioned and advised to read the contents of this solicitation in its entirety, to include any and all attachments to this RFP, prior to initiating questions or submitting comments to the government for consideration.  Offerors are strongly encouraged to register early and to submit their PAST PERFORMANCE – Volume 2 electronic information early, consistent with the instructions in this solicitation.  Questions or comments about this RFP may be submitted ONLY as specifically indicated in Section L of the RFP.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requires an electron beam lithography system for the NIST Advanced Measurement Laboratory (AML) Nanofab.  The e-beam lithography system is to be used for both direct write lithography and mask writing. 

The Contractor is responsible for supplying the lithography system as well as any vibration, acoustic, and electromagnetic isolation required to meet the technical specifications.  

The NIST AML Nanofab will be operated as a shared access user facility.  This means that the staff of NIST and its partners, subject to provisions, training, and user fees, will be permitted to independently operate much of the equipment.  

The e-beam lithography tool being procured will likely have only two certified operators.  The tools will be operated in a manner such that a wide variety of materials can be processed.  The facility will be directed by NIST’s Semiconductor Electronics Division. Unlike other Nanofabs, the NIST AML Nanofab is unique in that it is located next to the most advanced metrology tools in the world, and its focus will be on fabricating nanoscale structures necessary for metrology and standards in support of the semiconductor industry, nanotechnology, biotechnology, and homeland security.  

This requirement is being procured using Simplified Acquisition 
Procedures under the authority of FAR Part 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items via full & open competition.

The NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.

The competitive Request for Quotation (RFQ), specifications, any subsequent amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFQ number 
SB1341-05-Q-0673.

The RFQ is anticipated for release to the vendor community on or about June 7, 2005, and will only be available via the Internet at the above web site.

Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the web site.  Interested parties must respond to the RFQ in order to be considered for award of any resultant purchase order.   No written solicitation document is available, telephone requests shall not be honored, and no bidders list shall be maintained.  Potential offerors are requested to direct all questions via e-mail to Carol.Wood@NIST.Gov.

THE DUE DATE FOR QUOTATIONS SHALL BE JULY 28, 2005.

<DESC>The Air Force Air Mobility Battlelab is exploring the feasibility and military utility of commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) crashworthy seats for loadmasters in C-130 E/H model aircraft cargo compartments.  To be feasible, seats would conform to the Personnel Restraint category of table 513.5-III of the Mil-Std-810F and have a 4-point restraint harness with head rest/support.  The occupant must be able to perform all required duties while seated and wearing full protective gear to include flak and survival vests, helmet, and Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensemble.  In addition to seat information, the Battlelab seeks mounting concepts that would enable the placement of a forward facing seat forward of the right-hand paratroop door and an aft facing seat located aft of the crew entry door.  Mounting method would not interfere with established C-130 cargo loading and airdrop operations or egress procedures; would not reduce troop and cargo capacity; and would not require structural mounting to the C-130 cargo deck (all structural connections would have to be made to aircraft bulkheads or frames).  Mounting concepts that provide for quick installation, removal, and interchangeability between different locations in the cargo compartment are highly desired.  Seat would comply with applicable sections of Flammability Federal Aviation Regulation 25.853 and Mil Std-1472F.  Through this request for information (RFI), the Battlelab is requesting information concerning mature technologies, which meet the requirements previously stated.  This RFI may be followed by a request for proposal to conduct a Battlelab Concept Demonstration.  All possible offerors are strongly encouraged to submit information supporting this request.  NOTICE TO FOREIGN OFFERORS: Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures and restrictions that could preclude their participation in this announcement.  SUBMISSIONS: Product information may be submitted until COB EST 25 October 2005.  White papers should not exceed five pages and should include cost estimates.  Electronic responses shall be submitted in MS Word format or Adobe PDF file.  Refer technical questions and submit product information to Mr. Kenneth Interval of Concurrent Technologies Corporation via email at intervak@ctc.com or by mail to 100 CTC Drive, Johnstown, PA 15904-1935.  THE SINGLE POINT OF CONTACT CONCERNING THIS RFI IS MR. INTERVAL.  You may contact Mr. Interval with any questions you may have at (814) 269-6461.  Electronic submittals are strongly encouraged.  GENERAL RFI INFORMATION: The purpose of this RFI is to obtain information about market information or capabilities for planning purposes as defined in FAR 15.201(e).

<DESC>POC:  Contract Specialist: Gail Thompson (309) 782-5158, Procuring Contracting Officer: Mary S. Adams (309) 782-4841, Technical: Frank Reynolds (309) 782-0103. The purpose of this Sources Sought/Market Research is to identify potential sources capable of manufacturing the MK135 Mod 1,  Multi-Color, Personnel Distress, Signal Kit. The personnel distress signal kit MK135 is used by downed aircrew or other exposed personnel during search and rescue operations.  The distress kit is small and lightweight and is carried in the pocket of a flight suit.  THe kit includes a hand held projec tor MK31, seven illumination signals contained in a plastic bandoleer, and an instruction sheet; all packaged in a moisture proof resealable plastic bag.  The kit contains 3 red MK80, 2 gree MK110 and 2 white MK134 pyrotechnic signals.  The exterior surfac e of the signal represents the color of the candle. The projector consists of a steel cyliner body approximately 5 inches long and 0.5 inches in diameter; knurled to provide a positive gripping surface.  A 48-inch polyproplene cord (lanyard) attaches the bandoleer to an eyebolt at the base of the projector.   The firing end of the projector is internally threaded to accept a signal.  The firing mechanism consists of a trigger screw which moves freely though a slot when released from the safety position.  The firing pin, powered by a helical spring located in the knurled portion (handle section), is internally attached to the trigger screw and impacts the signal primer.  When fired, expanding gases eject the signal from the projector and ignite a first fire change.  The signal burns for approximately 4.5 second s, reaches altitudes in excess of 250 feet and operates as stated in the Technical Data Package (TDP). Estimated procurement would be 6,000 kits/year, up to 4 years totaling 24,000 kits.  The government may require a surge or increase in procurement amount per month based on user expenditures. Request interested parties provide: 1.  Time frame to first delivery.  The government requires First Article Test with anticpated first product delivery by April 2006.  Provide realistic achievable accelerated delivery schedule. 2.  Minimum order quantities and full rate production quantities. 3.  Identify factors that effect minimum order quantities and long lead time.  4.  Provide a Rough Order Magnitude (ROM) cost, for minimum order quantities and full-rate production. 5.  Provide single shift capacity, maximum production capacity, how a shift is defined (ex. 8hr/day; 5 day/wk), if production resources are shared with other items and any limiting factors. 6.  List of currently or previously produced items that are representative of the Multi-colored, Personnel Distress Signal Kit MK135.  Include information on experience and capability in pyrotechnic formulations/handling, pressing and assembly. 7.  The government will consider other commercial or non-development products meeting the characteristics/performance of the MK135 multi-colored peronnel distress signal kit.  Performance characteristics, specifications, graphics depictions/videos, and oth er supporting documentation may be submitted for government review.

<DESC>This is a formal public announcement made in accordance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 (Revised May 29, 2003).  The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) will conduct an A-76 Streamlined Competition of the Voice of America (VOA) Central News Division’s News File located in Hong Kong.

The purpose of the study is to determine the most efficient and cost effective method of providing these services for the BBG.  Five (5) VOA full-time employees (FTE’s) who are located in the Central News Division in Washington, D.C are currently performing the work.   An agency may develop an estimated contract price for performing the activity with a private sector source the using documented market research or soliciting cost proposals in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).   The BBG will use market research and cost proposals for this Streamlined Competition.  In accordance with A-76, the BBG will complete a Streamlined Competition Form (SLCF) to compare the estimated cost of agency performance with the estimated cost of private sector performance.  This is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the BBG to award a contract.  No solicitation exists at this time.  Any solicitation resulting from this Streamlined Competition will be made available on www.fedbizopps.gov if and when it is released.  The projected end date of the streamlined competition is on or before November 30, 2005.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INDUSTRY COMMENT ON DRAFT TWO-PHASE DESIGN BUILD REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS FOR THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF BRIGADE COMBAT TEAM (BCT) FACILITIES INSTRUCTIONS TO REVIEWERS: In support of the Armys Transformation and Realignment Programs, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is inviting questions, comments, and recommendations from the DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY (NAICS CODES STARTING WITH 236, 237, 238, 541) on a DR AFT Two-Phase Design Build Request for Proposals (RFP) to be used for the first generation of Brigade Combat Team (BCT) facilities, beginning with selected Fiscal Year 2006 Military Construction Program projects.  This DRAFT RFP is posted to FEDBIZOPS unde r W912QU05R9999 (W912QU-05-R-9999) entitled DRAFT DESIGN BUILD RFP FOR COMMENT BY DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY.   Questions, comments, and recommendations are to be emailed to Mr. Michael Duffy (256-895-1793) on or before 4:00 P.M. Central Time on October 14, 2005 at the following email address: Michael.R.Duffy@usace.army.mil  Reviewers shall provide the Reviewers Name, Firm Name, and Contact Information with active email address.   All questions, comments, and recommendations are to be provided in MS Word Format ONLY using the attached form and pre-set format for responding to this request for ease of review by the USACE team.     All responses will be consolidated by the USACE team.  All questions, comments and recommendations will be addressed by email to all responders (please ensure that the email address provided is correct).     After all questions, comments, and recommendations have been addressed, a REVISED DRAFT RFP may be posted for an additional review and comment period, should time allow.   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: The objectives of the Armys Transformation and Realignment Programs are to design and construct new Brigade Combat Team (BCT) facilities for the U. S. Army that are consistent with the design and construction practices used for civilian sector projects th at perform similar functions to the military projects.  For example, a Dining Facility has a similar function as College or Corporate Cafeteria in the civilian sector  provide a variety of freshly prepared cold and hot nutritious meals three times a day u sing serving lines and islands (additional inherently governmental field feeding requirements will also need to be addressed); hence the design and construction of the facility should be consistent with the design and construction of College or Corporate C afeteria with the additional capacity to handle field feeding needs.  A further comparison of Military Facilities to Civilian Facilities is listed here: Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH)  Apartment/College Dormitory, Battalion/Brigade Headqu arters (BH)  Corporate Office, Company Operations Facilities (COF)  Office/Warehouse, Dining Facility (DF)  College/Corporate Cafeteria, Tactical Equipment Maintenance Facility (TEMF)  Heavy Equipment/Vehicle Maintenance Garage. It is the U.S. Armys objective that the facilities are required to have a minimum 25-year useful life before needing any major renovation, repair, or replacement (i.e., communications wiring or materials like roofing, flooring, and lighting - not referrin g to entire building replacement).  Therefore, the design and construction should provide an appropriate level of quality to ensure the continued use of the facility over that time period with the application of reasonable preventive maintenance and repair s that would be industry-acceptable to a major civilian sector project owner.  The design and construction should also allow for flexibility in the facility to handle the changing needs/size of the Army over time.  The site infrastructure is required to ha ve a minimum 50-year life expectancy with industry-accepted maintenance and repair cycles. The government is required by Public Law 102-486, Executive Order 12902, and Federal Regulations 10 CFR  435 to design and construct facilities in an energy-conserving manner while considering life cycle cost over the life of the facilities. The project site(s) should be developed for efficiency and to convey a sense of unity or connectivity with the adjacent buildings and with the Installation as a whole. This DRAFT RFP is meant to be Performance Based in nature and the requirements stated in this DRAFT RFP are minimums.  Industry is encouraged to comment on how USACE can ensure that it receives innovative, creative, and lower life-cycle cost effective solu tions, which meet or exceed the DRAFT RFP requirements.  This should also include the level of prescriptive detail that may conflict with a Performance Based Acquisition. Additionally, the industry is encouraged to comment on how USACE can expedite the design and construction schedule based on the requirements in this DRAFT RFP.   DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAFT RFP: The Army and USACE currently anticipates that the initial contracts awarded for the BCT facilities will be procured using Design Build contracts to meet its facility requirements.  The contracts will be awarded using a Trade-Off Process to determine the ov erall Best-Value contractor for that project.  The contracts may be single award or multiple award contracts for use at one or multiple installations.  The contracts also may be Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) type contracts where task orde rs would be written for specific projects under the base contract.  It is expected that the work may be performed either locally, (at one specific installation) or regionally (within a yet to be defined area for work at multiple installations in the define d area) depending on the facility type.  This DRAFT RFP is not meant to be specific to any project or location.  This DRAFT RFP has been developed in order to attempt to provide a consistent procurement vehicle and process to evaluate and award Design Build contracts across all U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers district offices.  It does not reflect any particular acquisition strategy selected by the executing districts.  The DRAFT RFP is for a hypothetical Single Award Design Build contract for an entire Brigade Combat Team (BCT) Project using a 2-Pha se procurement method.   This DRAFT RFP when finalized will likely be used on actual projects that involve less than a full BCT requirement by selecting the appropriate facility types, then editing out the non-applicable Scope of Work in Section 01010 and in Sections 00110 and 001 20 - Proposal Submission Requirements, and Proposal Evaluation and Basis for Award.   The DRAFT RFP assumes that the BCT will be a green grass project, to be built in an undeveloped area within the installations fence line.  The DRAFT RFP does not address demolition requirements for in-fill of BCT facilities or renovations to existing faci lities.  The executing U.S. Army Corps of Engineers district will add such requirements when applicable to a project, in addition to any other site specific requirements.

Accordingly, MSG Battalion in concert and with participation from DS has established the Equipment and Tactics Advisory Group (ETAG). The purpose of the ETAG is to develop a standard set of emergency response equipment. The ASP 'Airweight' 21 INCH expandable baton (has been procured by DS and used by DS agents for approximately 7 years) will replace the Monadnock PR-24 currently in use.  This decision was made based on the amount of training time needed to certify MSGs on the PR-24, difficulty to conceal the baton, and historical data on the actual uses of the baton by MSGS.  Additionally, most law enforcement agencies, including Marine Corps Military Police and DoS Diplomatic Security Special Agents, have already transitioned to an expandable baton.  The ASP is easier to conceal and requires less time to train at MSG School and sustain training on post.  The time saved will allow MSG School to conduct more weapons and reactionary training and will ease some of the training burden on MSGs at post. The DS Firearms Policy Review Board approved the ACC 170 Baton for use by the Marine Security Guards on 23 June 2005 and State Cable number 125229 dated 6 July 2005, Subject: MSG Program Approval for Deployment of Expandable Batons and Drop Style Holsters was transmitted.  (this is a classified cable). *MUST BE DELIVERED BY 10/14/05.  NO PARTIAL SHIPMENTS.  IF YOU CANNOT MEET 10/14/05 DELIVERY, DO NOT BID.  NO EXCEPTIONS.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

Background

On January 9, 2005, the Government of Sudan (GOS) and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) signed the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) officially ending Africa's longest running civil war.  Over the course of the 21-year conflict, fighting, famine, and disease killed more than 2 million people, forced an estimated 628,000 people to seek refuge in neighboring countries, and displaced more than 4 million people within Sudan - the largest internally displaced person (IDP) population in the world.  In April 2003, a separate conflict began in Darfur, Western Sudan when the locally based Sudanese Liberation Movement/Army (SLM/A) attacked GOS security forces in the city of El Fasher.  The resulting humanitarian emergency in Darfur affects an estimated 2.6 million people, approximately 40 percent of the population, including 2 million IDPs and 180,000 refugees in eastern Chad.  The concurrent emergencies have exacerbated already fragile humanitarian conditions, and challenged local capacity to provide for the population.

Introduction

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director.

The Sudan Program Officer will be part of the OFDA team based in Khartoum, Sudan.  The position will be contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.  Foreign language ability in one or more major world languages is preferred.


OBJECTIVE

OFDA must recruit a Program Officer for Northern Sudan in order to meet its program objectives.  The incumbent will serve as a primary point of contact for OFDA in the field and is responsible for developing strategies and plans, reviewing proposals, monitoring grants, liaising with grantees and other members of the humanitarian community, and reporting on the humanitarian situation.

STATEMENT OF WORK

The OFDA Program Officer will primarily provide full time in-country coordination and management of the humanitarian emergency in areas defined as under the authority of the Government of National Unity in Northern Sudan and the transitional areas.  The Program Officer may assist in humanitarian assistance activities in all parts of Sudan as needed.

The current USAID structure in Sudan consists of a Sudan Field Office in Nairobi, Kenya which coordinates all assistance to Government of Southern Sudan (GOSS) areas, and an office in Khartoum which covers the Northern provinces, including Darfur, and the transitional areas.  All DCHA staff, including OFDA, Food for Peace (FFP) and the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI), fall under the overall management of the DCHA Senior Humanitarian Advisor based in Khartoum.  There is close daily coordination between the DCHA units in Nairobi, Kenya and Khartoum, and with the development programs managed by the Sudan Field Office.  The Program Officer will exchange information regularly with colleagues covering Southern Sudan and Darfur portfolios, as well as with the Sudan program team in Washington D.C.  This includes sharing project ideas, strategies, and soliciting advice and guidance.

The Program Officer will work and live in Khartoum, reporting to the Senior Humanitarian Advisor and to the Sudan Program Team in Washington D.C.  S/he will work with a small team of experienced national staff specializing in the areas of food security, health, gender, and livelihoods.  Each national staff member also is responsible for a specific geographic area and specific grants.  The Program Officer will ensure a smooth allocation of the work load between all national staff so that maximum efficiency is achieved.

This position requires substantial daily coordination with several OFDA staff members, as well as representatives from other USAID offices and the humanitarian community, and therefore requires a highly collaborative work style.  The Program Officer must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly abide to U.S. Embassy security guidelines.  The incumbent may be required to serve as a critical component of a U.S. government disaster assessment team, a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART), a Response Management Team (RMT), or to backfill other staff members in the overseas office.

We have 2 lifts of the same model the second lift is a Mohawk model TR25, serial #9301062 and should no parts be needed from the second lift to make the first lift operational then we would require the second lift with an estimated 140 foot electrical run be installed to full working order to include the safety certificate.

<DESC>Decision Matrix
Hiring contract employees for Test Administration 
Education center – MacDill AFB
a/o 2005

Education - MIB
	HS Diploma 					= 0
	AA Diploma 					= 2
	BA/BS Diploma 				= 4
	BA/BS Education related 			= 5
	BA/BS Counseling related			= 6
	MA/MS Diploma 				= 8
	MA/MS Diploma Ed/Counseling related	= 10

Experience - MIB
None / Unsuccessful work history						= 0
	Successful, but not in a related field						= 2 
	Successful in a related field, but not within the military/government	= 4
	Successful in a related field that is with the military/governmental		= 6
	Successful in exactly same job with a DoD Education Center		= 8

Cost - MIB (bid price)
	Rank order candidates with highest bid awarded a 1, 2nd highest bid awarded a 2 and so on.  The lowest cost bid will be at the top of the list and will receive a score equal to the total number of candidates.  

Interview Results - MIB (phone, resume, meetings and etc.)
	Leadership interview candidates and/or evaluate resume packages to determine an order of merit list.   Most effective resume package is placed at the top of the list and least effective resume package is placed at the bottom of the list.   Bottom candidate is awarded a 1, second from bottom is awarded a 2 and so on.

References – MIB (Personal observations, written, phone and etc.)
	Candidates’ references will be rank ordered in an order of merit list by leadership with the worst reference awarded a 1 and the best reference awarded a score equal to the total number of candidates.

Instructions for scoring ties on an order of merit list
In the event of an exact tie such as a contract bid, those candidates are awarded the same exact final score.   To determine that score first determine the location scores on the OML for all tied candidates.  Then divide the total of those tied location scores by number of tied individuals.  As an example:  if two candidates are have the submitted the highest bids at exactly the same cost then those two candidates are tied for the 1st and 2nd positions on the merit list.  The value of those positions is 1 and 2 points.  1 point + 2 points = 3 points.   3 points / two candidates = 1.5 points   Therefore these two tied candidates would be awarded 1.5 points each.
****!! To all prospective offerors, the attach document is the matrix on how the decision will be made for award. Please base your bid on the price for the number of sessions not per hour(s). 

The deadline for submission will not be extended!!!!

Interpreting Services
September 26, 2005

The purpose of this amendment is to post questions/answers to inquires received.  All questions should be in writing and can be sent to Teresa Knotts at facsimile (614) 693-5674 or email at teresa.knotts@dfas.mil.


Questions and Answers

Question – I see here in the solicitation that the services are on an “as needed” basis.  Does this mean that there will not be the requirement to have any one-site services to any of the locations you have listed?

Answer – That is correct.


Question – It appears the request is for 27 sites – Is it possible to provide a bid to DFAS for a specific location only?

Answer – No.


Question – Is it possible for an “out of area” agency to provide the interpreting services necessary for all of the sites or would this contract require the contractor to sub-contract with local interpreters on a regular basis for each site?

Answer – The awardee has to be able to provide services to all 27 DFAS sites listed and how you elect to do this is your business decision.


Question – Will only one agency be awarded under this contract?

Answer – Yes.


Question – Can you explain more about the international trips?  What city is the employee(s) located in now?  That way we can gauge the willingness of our local interpreters to join the employee(s) on the trip.

Answer – We do have sites in Germany, Japans, and Hawaii; however, currently there are no deaf employees and we do not anticipate that the interpreting agency will need to travel internationally.


Question – Certain markets travel time is a requirement imposed by all interpreters.  Are we allowed to provide a reasonable explanation when that is the case for exemption of the travel rule on a case by case basis?

Answer – We are not sure what is meant by the first statement.  All travel will be reimbursed at the rate specified in the Joint Travel Regulation (JTR) for hotels, meals, and incidental expenses in all cases where the place of performance is more than a 50 mile radius from the closest trainer/facilitator’s home of residence or the contractor’s facility.  Government travel information can be accessed at the following websites:  http://www/gsa/gov/Portal/home.jsp and http://www.govexec.com/travel.


Question – Certain markets are priced extremely different, i.e. Arlington VA vs. Charleston, SC.  May we provide pricing at the market level as well?  This will ultimately provide a better value for the Government since the costs will not have to be averaged across all the markets.

Answer – The solicitation will be amended to price by location.


Question – Do you have historical data for each of the markets?  This will allow us to determine better pricing and availability in high volume markets.

Answer – There is data for all of the sites that we currently service; however, we are not sure what is meant by “historical data for each of the markets”.  Most interpreting agencies are readily listed on the web.


Question – Is the agency considering establishing Video Remote Interpreting (VRI) as an optional service?  Department of Transportation just rolled out their video access with great success.  May we include information and pricing for this option service?

Answer – While we have had some experience with VRI, there are currently no plans to implement this service agency wide.
