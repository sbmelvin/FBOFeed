<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) seeks to develop a set of implementation guides that use the Health Level Seven (HL7) Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) standard for reporting healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) from healthcare facilities that use vendor infection control surveillance applications to CDC?s National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).  The Clinical Document Architecture for reporting HAIs will allow healthcare facilities that use vendor infection control surveillance applications to participate in NHSN.   This approach uses an industry standard format for exchange of healthcare data to enable wider participation in a Government-sponsored, national-level HAI surveillance program.  As a result, NHSN?s healthcare facility coverage will be expanded through a standards-based, public-private partnership that capitalizes on advances in informatics and information technology. Award of a Firm-Fixed Price Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13 is contemplated. The period of performance and delivery schedule shall be proposed by the quoter. CDC will consider all responsible sources responding to this RFQ. All questions/concerns about the RFQ shall be submitted via e-mail to Bbiltz@cdc.gov. The RFQ document will be available and posted at this site for downloading. No telephone requests of the solicitation will be accepted. No hard copy of the RFQ will be mailed. It is your responsibility to keep up with additional postings regarding the RFP on the Fedbizopps website.

The objective of the NACHOS program is to develop novel, ultra small lasers that are sub wavelength in all three dimensions, including the feedback structure integrated with the gain medium.  Specific program goals include:
	
	Gain and feedback structures smaller than the wavelength of emitted light, sub wavelength in all three dimensions
	Defect free media and low-loss feedback structures
	Structures with lithographically defined placement and size 
	Full computational modeling 
	Sub wavelength&#61472;injection laser operating CW at room temperature with the free space emission wavelength that is less than or equal to 1.55 microns

Proposals which do not provide a well defined path to sub wavelength lasers are discouraged and will not be considered for this program. 

DARPA may consider compelling proposals with highly innovative technical approaches that fall short of the above program goals. Those offering such proposals should provide unambiguous physical arguments, based on data, simulations, and calculations, leading to estimates of practical and fundamental performance limits in operational parameters of the envisioned NACHOS laser.

The NACHOS program will be conducted in three Phases, each having definite and measurable milestones, the most critical of which will be referred to as Go/No-Go (GNG) metrics.  The period of performance for each of these Phases and the milestone schedule will be proposed by bidders within their technical proposals and will be factors considered as part of the source selection process.  In general, a shorter phase is preferable, but each Phase should clearly be adequate in duration to meet its objectives with reasonable risks and costs.  Proposals should discuss plans for managing these factors.

DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following areas:

I. Demonstration of scalable gain medium; 
II.  Demonstration of effective sub wavelength feedback structures; 
III.  Modeling.

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 06-42 Proposer Information Pamphlet referred below.

PROGRAM SCOPE

The Nanoscale Architecture for Coherent Hyper-Optic Sources (NACHOS) program will consist of a Phase I (duration of Phase I should be specified by proposers in the full proposal), followed by a Phase II and Phase III (duration of Phase II and Phase III should be specified by proposers in the full proposal), for those efforts that appear to have the greatest potential for production, insertion, transition or overall benefit to DoD.  Offerors wishing to participate in Phase II and Phase III should include them as options in their proposal.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are encouraged.  A web site (http://www.davincinetbook.com/teams) has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  The technical POC for this effort is Henryk Temkin, fax:  (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: BAA06-42@darpa.mil.

PROPOSERS QUESTIONS

A Proposers Questions, website will be posted for BAA 06-42 on the DARPA, Microsystems Technology Office solicitations page (www.darpa.mil/baa/#eto).  If you would like to have a question answered and posted on this site, please send your question to the following address: BAA06-42@darpa.mil.
  
GENERAL INFORMATION

Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled BAA 06-42, Nanoscale Architectures for Coherent Hyper-Optic Sources (NACHOS), Proposer Information Pamphlet which provides further information on the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal abstract formats, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, Grants.gov website: http://www.grants.gov/,World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.   Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed. 

 In order to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review, proposers are strongly encouraged to submit proposal abstracts in advance of full proposals.  The proposal abstract must be submitted to https://www.tfims.darpa.mil/baa on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Friday, September 15, 2006.  Proposal abstracts received after this time and date may not be reviewed.  Upon review, DARPA will provide written feedback on the likelihood of a full proposal being selected and the time and date for submission of a full proposal.  Proposal abstracts should not be submitted via grants.gov - the "Apply" function will be available for submission of full proposals should University offerors choose to submit in this way.  

Proposers not submitting proposal abstracts must submit a full proposal to https://www.tfims.darpa.mil/baa, or via grants.gov for Universities wishing to use the "Apply" function, on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Tuesday, November 21, 2006 in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps and Grants.gov.  Full proposals submitted after the due date specified in the BAA or due date otherwise specified by DARPA after review of proposal abstracts may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 06-42, Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DARPA.  Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants /experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as Government Only.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority Institutions (MIs), and Small and Small Disadvantaged Businesses are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for these organizations participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in deep ultraviolet avalanche photodetectors.

<DESC>Solicitation N00421-07-T-0068 is issued as a request for quote (RFQ).  This action is not set aside for small business.  The Government intends to purchase on a firm fixed-price basis and to solicit and negotiate the proposed purchase order on a sole source basis with Audio Video Systems, Inc. for the item listed below, under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1. The required Dial Isolation Module, RS-366 Optical Isolation is in support of the United States Marine Force?s Central Command (MARCENT) program for Southwest Asia (SWA) Commercialization and Technical Control Facility (TCF) upgrades.  This equipment is required for the integration and installation of Joint/Combined theater communications based on contractor maintained and operated Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) nodes supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIP).  In order to provide secure Video Teleconference (VTC) capabilities a Dial Isolation Module is required.  The isolation module provides a secure method for dialing from classified data systems using the RS-366 interface and without using a separate IMUX terminal to do the dialing.  Without this equipment, the systems would lack the ability to transfer data.  The equipment specified in this procurement has been approved and standardized by the MCSC for providing critical services and capabilities to its component commands.  Defense Information Systems Agency approved for secure VTC.  The commonality of equipment affords MCSC the ability to technically support its component commands from its headquarters, whether the units are deployed or in garrison.  It also allows MCSC to have a limited number of service and support contracts to maintain the equipment.  The contract line item number and description is **CLIN 0001, Quantity 16 ea, P/N: AVS-AVSIM-366.  Award is expected 28 February 2007.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government will consider all proposals received by 22 February 2007.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The Government will not pay for any information received.  Facsimile proposals are acceptable.  For information contact Mary Jean Orwig, Code 251233, Telephone (301)995-8112, FAX(301)995-8670 or via e-mail: mary.orwig@navy.mil.

<DESC>The objective of this contract is to provide NIEHS investigators with access to genetically altered mice.  For transgenic studies, NIEHS investigators generate the transgenic construct by cloning the transgene of interest downstream of a tissue-specific or ubiquitous promoter.  NIEHS investigators also develop genotyping methods to identify founder mice.  The Contractor shall microinject the linearized transgenic constructs into single cell mouse embryos which are then implanted into pseudopregnant mice to produce founders.  The Contractor shall assist with tail biopsies and genotyping, and deliver transgenic founder mice to NIEHS for expansion of the lines and phenotypic characterization.  For knockout mice, NIEHS investigators generate the knockout construct and develop genotyping methods to identify targeted ES cell lines.  The Contractor shall electroporate the ES cells with the construct, select and maintain the targeted ES cell lines, perform blastocyst microinjections, and perform implantations into pseudopregnant mice shall be compiled to produce chimeric offspring.  The Contractor shall assist with tail biopsies and genotyping, and deliver chimera to NIEHS for expansion of the lines and phenotypic characterization.  Detailed health surveillance information on all the mice prior to transfer to NIEHS.  Examples of new transgenic and knockout mouse lines developed by NIEHS investigators over the past year under this contract include the following: pTETmITSN, Tie2-CYP2C8, Tie2-CYP2J2, N3-2, HABAf60a140, CMV-ITSN, pCIITIH2, pCIITIH5, tetolTIH2, tetolTIH5, rtTA, and rTS." The anticipated effective date for the award is September 30, 2007.  The contract will consist of a two year base period and four two year options.  The contract will be a cost reimbursement completion type contract.  For estimating purposes the Government anticipates an approximate level-of-effort of 832 professional direct labor hours for the base period and 832 professional direct labor hours for each optional period for a total of 4,160 direct labor hours. All requests must reference RFP No. NIH-ES-07-03 and must be directed to the office listed above.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation/notice of intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only
solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This requirement is being issued as a Notice of Intent under NOI6094.
This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 05-12.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is a small
business set-aside.  The switching to any other contractor other than Formulatrix Inc. would result in significant time delay of research and additional cost to the government.  Project numbers and titles: Z01-AI-005022 Neutralization Mechanisma of Anti-HIV-1 Monoclonal Antibodies, Z01-AI-005023 Mechanisms of Humoral Evasion, Z01-AI-005024 Design of Immunogens. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 511210 and the Small Business Size Standard is $23.0.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to procure an imaging system to fully integrate with the existing robotic systems to result in only one interface for the users.  The NIAID requires an imaging system which can image crystallization setups in a manner which is quick, clean, maintain consistent temperature, generate a composite image of the droplet across the z axis and all without disturbing the droplets.  The goal of our lab is with the use of atomic structure to design a vaccine against HIV. This involves the purification, crystallization and structure determination of various proteins.  It is of the utmost important that the imaging robot be fully integrated with the existing system.  This involves the ability to use the sequel server platform on the imaging system.  The NIAID requires the capability to track droplet history for each droplet in each crystallization try.  The customization will facilitate the tracking of each crystallization droplet, along with solutions in the droplet and date of crystallization.  The RockImager 182 has the capabilities to efficiently image the crystallization trials and to cross reference the many crystallization conditions with each droplet. This robotic system will interface with existing RockImager 182 robotic systems.  This integrated crystallization system will create screens, setup droplets and image them.  For each droplet, the system will track its history using the RockImager 182 software. The RockImager 182 has specific unique properties which make it ideal for  research i.e. drop location, multi capture, extended focus imaging, auto focus, custom scheduling, peltier heat exchanger, 5MP color CCD camera, built in bar scanner and plate capacity of 182 trays.  The FOB Point shall be Destination, Bethesda, MD 20892.  The government will award a firm fixed price purchase order to the responsible contractor.  All responses will be considered by the agency.

<SUBJECT>66--Spectrally Tunable Lighting Source
<SOLNBR>SB1341-07-RP-0008
<RESPDATE>032207
<ARCHDATE>04062007
<CONTACT>Carol  Wood, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-975-8172, Fax 301-975-8884, Email carol.wood@nist.gov - Todd Hill, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-975-8802, Email todd.hill@nist.gov
<DESC>Solid-state lighting and other burgeoning technologies are strongly dependent on photometric and colorimetric metrics, or systems of related measures that facilitate the quantification of particular characteristics.  In some cases, present metrics are inappropriate for use with the new technologies; in other cases, the necessary metrics and measurements simply do not exist.  One illustrative example is solid-state lighting using light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which promises substantial energy savings if implemented for general lighting.  However, existing metrics and measurements are insufficient for evaluating the color quality of such lights, necessary for optimizing the spectral output to simultaneously satisfy consumer demands for good color quality and high energy efficiency. Metrics guide product design and developers optimize products to the metrics available.

Vision science underlies all photometric and colorimetric metrics and measurements. NIST is establishing a new state-of-the-art vision science program, which will be unique among national metrology institutes and national laboratories.  This program will provide the capabilities to perform critical vision science experiments necessary to develop colorimetric and photometric metrics optimized for technologies of the 21st century. The crux of the new facility will be an illumination source capable of producing any spectral power distribution within the visible range for testing colorimetric and photometric metrics. Studies of visual perception related to photometry and colorimetry have traditionally been limited by available light sources.  As a consequence, many important issues have not been adequately investigated.  Ideally, an experiment would manipulate only one parameter, holding all other variables constant.  The spectral, spatial, and temporal properties of available lamps are limited and interdependent.  

The purpose of this acquisition is to design and manufacture a novel spectrally-tunable light source to conduct the most rigorous and well-controlled visual experiments.  This innovative light source must be capable of producing any spectral distribution of light at any illumination level up to approximately 500 lx (office lighting levels).

The period of performance shall be 6 months from the date of award.

This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small business.  In accordance with the non-manufacturer rule, the manufacturer and distributor of these supplies must be a small business in accordance with the NAICS code identified.  For size purposes, there can be only one manufacturer of the end item being acquired. The manufacturer is the concern which, with its own facilities, performs the primary activities in transforming inorganic or organic substances, including the assembly of parts and components, into the end item being acquired.  The end item must possess characteristics which, as a result of mechanical, chemical or human action, it did not possess before the original substances, parts or components were assembled or transformed. The end item may be finished and ready for utilization or consumption, or it may be semifinished as a raw material to be used in further manufacturing. Firms which perform only minimal operations upon the item being procured do not qualify as manufacturers of the end item. 

A fixed-price contract is anticipated.

The NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees.

The competitive Request for Proposal (RFP), RFP amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement will be made available via the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ under RFP number SB1341-07-RP-0008.

THE RFP IS ANTICIPATED FOR RELEASE TO THE VENDOR COMMUNITY ON OR ABOUT FEBRUARY 22, 2007, AND WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE VIA THE INTERNET AT THE ABOVE WEB SITE.  

POTENTIAL OFFERORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ACCESSING THE WEB SITE.  

Interested parties must respond to the RFP in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.  

THERE IS NO WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT AVAILABLE, TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL NOT BE HONORED, AND NO BIDDERS LIST WILL BE MAINTAINED.  Potential offerors are requested to direct all questions via email to Carol.Wood@NIST.GOV

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) on behalf of the U.S. Army Medical Materiel Center, Europe (USAMMCE) and U.S. Army Medical Materiel Agency (USAMMA) have routine and recurring requirements for medical consumable supplies.   Consumable medical supplies are products which are consumed when used and later disposed of.  Most of these items are issued by USAMMCE to fulfill needs at hospitals and clinics in Europe and the medical units in Iraq and Afghanistan and other areas of S outhwest Asia.   Some of the medical supplies ordered will be used by USAMMCE to build new or replenish sets, kits, and outfits (SKOs) and unit assemblages (UAs).  The resultant award(s) will not be used to supply the building of sets, kits and outfits don e by USAMMA, but may be used to order replacement items for the sets, kits and outfits once they have been deployed to their using units.  The Government intends to issue multiple award IDIQ contracts or multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) for thes e consumable medical supplies. This procurement is set-aside for small businesses.  A sample list of items (Solicitation Attachment A) will be attached to the forthcoming solicitation and shall be the basis for quotes on this solicitation.  Also at Solicit ation Attachment B will be a listing of the manufacturers of typical products that will be bought with this contract instrument.  The Government is looking for established small business firms with the requisite medical supply, distribution, and business p rocess experience as well as connections with major manufacturers or distributors to provide these medical supplies in a timely, effective, efficient manner in concert with the Food and Drug Administration's regulations at a fair and reasonable price.  All  offerors must be able to process orders for FDA approved items in accordance with FDA procedures and must have a quality control system that covers quality control issues to include product notices and recalls per FDA guidelines.  Most orders will be bran d name only but in some instances brand name or equal will be specified.  Most consumable products requested by USAMMCE are supported by a physician request.  In some instances unique requirements will be solicited and substitutions will rarely be accepted .  Any possible substitute products quoted by vendors must first be evaluated by the customer.  The Government reserves the right to reject offered substitutes without discussion.  Most of the items ordered under these BPAs/IDIQs are destined for overseas and will be delivered (FOB Destination) to the Medical Air Bridge (MAB) at Hanover, Maryland.  Actual delivery point will be specified in each delivery order.

<DESC>The US Agency for International Development intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to solicit proposals from eligible and qualified firms/organizations to provide grants and financial management services in support of a multi-donor funded Civil Society Funding Mechanism (CSFM) activity that provides grants to indigenous organizations in support of activities scaling up effective and comprehensive responses to HIV/AIDS, orphans and vulnerable children (OVC), Tuberculosis and Malaria in Uganda.  The contractor will serve as the financial management agent (FMA) for the Civil Society Funding Mechanism (CSFM).
 
The contractor will be contractually accountable to USAID. However, the contractor will also be responsible to the participating donor agencies for successful management of their individual and pooled funds as outlined in a Memorandum of Understanding between the participating donors.  
 
The goal of the CSFM is to facilitate civil society to make greater and more effective contributions to the goals and priorities outlined in the National Strategic Plan (NSP) for HIV/AIDS, the National Strategic Programme Plan of Implementation (NSPPI) for OVC and the Health Sector Strategic Plan (HSSP) II for HIV/AIDS, Malaria and TB.  The purpose of the CSFM is to attract joint funds and disburse them swiftly and efficiently to civil society organizations to enable scaled up and effective comprehensive responses to HIV/AIDS, OVC, TB and Malaria. The CSFM allows for decision-making and allocation of collective resources based on analysis of gaps and local priorities, and is supposed to reduce the administrative burdens on both donors and civil society partners. 
  
This is a full and open competition and the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply. The authorized geographic code for this activity is 935. 
 
This RFP is expected to be issued o/a February 8, 2007 and will be distributed through the Federal Business Opportunities (http://www.fedbizopps.gov) website. Any amendments to this solicitation will also be issued and posted on this website.   All questions regarding this solicitation should be directed through the mechanism provided on the FedBizOpps website.

The release of this notice in no way obligates USAID or the U.S. Government to release an RFP or make an award of any type.

THIS ANNOUCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. 

Offerors are required to submit five (5) copies of a one-sided, 12 point type, single spaced, one inch margined white paper not to exceed five (5) pages with a cover letter indicating whether the offeror is a large, small, women-owned small, or small disadvantaged business or historically black college, university or minority institution. 

All responses to this announcement must be addressed to AFRL/IFEB, ATTN: Douglas Wynne (Reference BAA 03-12-IFKA) 525 Brooks Road, Rome, NY, 13441-4505. 

The white paper will be formatted as follows: SECTION A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task and Name of Company; SECTION B: Task Objective and SECTION C: Technical Summary. 

White papers must reference BAA 03-12-IFKA.     Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a). White papers addressing different areas of applicability must be submitted under separate cover. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. Offerors submitting white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Complete proposal instructions will be contained in a letter accepting your white paper and requesting a proposal. Such invitation does not assure the offeror will receive an award. Proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.

Evaluation of white papers and solicited proposals will be performed using the following criteria: 

(1) Effectiveness in Enhancing Modeling and Simulation for Supporting the Air Force Mission (Soundness of Approach); 
(2) Relevance to the Air Force Mission; 
(3) Uniqueness of the Approach, and 
(4) Cost Realism and Reasonableness. 

Criteria 1 through 3 are of equal importance and Criteria 1 through 3 are more important than Criteria 4. Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.     Individual white papers/proposals will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time. 

Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. Selected offerors may be required to review (and store) classified material at the SECRET and SCI (Special Compartmented Intelligence) level; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to the proposed effort must be cleared for access to SECRET and/or SCI information. 

In addition, the offeror must have or have access to a certified and Government-approved facility available to support work under this BAA. Individual awards will not exceed 36 months in duration; total dollar amounts for all awards is approximately $4.9M.     

The remaining estimated funding to be obligated is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 07 - $1.3M; FY 08 - $1.4M; and FY 09 - $1.6M.

Foreign participation is excluded at the prime contractor level.

Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data. 

The cost of preparing proposals in responding to this announcement is not an allowable direct charge to any resultant contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost as specified in FAR 31.205-18. An informational briefing is not planned.

Questions, clarification, or concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition should be communicated directly to the IFKA Contracting Officer, Lori Smith, telephone (315) 330-1955 or e-mail Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil.

PURPOSE/GENERAL INFORMATION.  The Air Force Surgeon General (AF/SGRKP), Brooks AFB, TX, is planning to contract for Air Force Biometrical Data Quality Assurance Service (Statement of Work attached).

The contract will be negotiated as Time & Materials (T&M), Firm Fixed Price Labor Hour.  Additionally, we currently anticipate the contract will have a basic period of performance of one (1) year with three additional one year options to extend the potential ordering period to four years.  

BACKGROUND AND PROGRAM INFORMATION.  This contract will serve to functionally replace services contained within AF/SGRKP?s existing Air Force Biometrical Data Quality Assurance Service, whose current ordering period will expire 31 March 2007.

<DESC>SOLICITATION: Solicitation Number: USTDA-07-Q-81-021, Definitional Mission for Agribusiness Sector in Albania issued as a RFQ.

The purpose of this amendment is to post a Question and an Answer 
about the above subject project.  QUESTION: CAN USTDA PROVIDE MORE SPECIFICS ON WHAT THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS DEFINITIONAL MISSION ARE SO WE CAN BE MORE RESPONSIVE IN DEVELOPING A PROPOSAL?  ANSWER: We have limited information from the Government of Albania, but their request specifically deals with developing new food processing plants.  They would like to develop new food processing plants to expand their agricultural exports to its neighbors and EU member countries.  They have some existing food processing plants and they produce frozen fruits and vegetables on a limited scale.  These facilities are privately owned, but the Government of Albania would like to devleop this market and develop a strategy for building new food processing plants for the various products mentioned above.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT, a Market Survey for written information only.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  No telephone calls will be accepted requesting a bid package or solicitation.  There is no bid package or solicitation in order to protect the procurement integrity of any future procurement, if any, that may arise from this announcement, information regarding the technical point of contract will not be given and no appointments for presentations will be made. 
The Naval Facilities Engineering Services Center (NFESC), Port Hueneme, CA is seeking sources for State-level legislative and regulatory monitoring, analysis, and tracking services, including assistance with information technology for organizing and managing follow-up on individual monitored items.  Monitoring services will be required to cover proposed state-level environmental legislative and regulatory actions which may have an impact on Department Of Defense operations in 50 states, District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico.  Interested sources should respond with brief documentation showing the company?s ability to fulfill the requirements described below.  Interested sources will indicate whether they offer the capability for full text searching of proposed state legislation and regulations.  Interested sources will briefly summarize their corporate history, level of experience with state legislative and regulatory process, and familiarity with U.S. environmental laws and regulations.  Interested sources will indicate whether their services also include consulting.  Interested sources will briefly summarize relevant information technology (IT) capabilities, in particular any already existing websites or tools you have to assist commercial clients in management of information, and your level of corporate experience in customizing or modifying such items to meet customer needs.  The principal recipients of the monitoring information are Regional Environmental Coordinators (RECs) within the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and DOD agencies.  To accomplish their designated work functions, RECs need tools to quickly distribute workload to various media and legal experts who are not co-located, review proposed state-level legislative and regulatory changes, classify and prioritize actions, generate detailed reports and archive related materials.  These tools will need to be web-based, to work around the issue of separate networks within DOD, and restrictions against installing software on client-side computers.  The NFESC is particularly interested in identifying providers that in addition to monitoring, can offer existing or cheaply implementable advanced information management systems that could be used to streamline the process of timely and systematic monitoring of emerging legislative and regulatory issues.  Specifically, NFESC is interested in organizations that perform legislative and regulatory monitoring and also have the ability to implement information management tools such as wikis, online Internet accessible databases, electronic reporting systems and full text searching of proposed legislation and regulations.  Monitoring of ?environmental issues? should include laws, regulations, rules, and ordinances that relate to such issues as air pollution, water pollution, drinking water quality, solid and hazardous waste management, resource conservation, recycling, water conservation, energy conservation, noise pollution, protection of cultural and natural resources, land use planning, hazardous materials transportation, toxic substances control, site remediation, spill contingency planning, worker health and safety, sustainability, environmental policy act programs, and encroachment.  ?Encroachment? includes any governmental action (of an environmental or land use nature) that could limit the ability of a client to operate. Examples of encroachment include: land use restrictions, habitat protection requirements, cultural resource protection, and new land development authorizations, zoning, or land use plan changes to permit such authorizations, that could limit operations.  Interested sources must submit any information relating to this announcement in writing via e-mail to Maria.Nailat@navy.mil  Responses received after this deadline may not be considered.   Since this is a sources sought announcement, no evaluation letters will be issued to the participants.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the University of Idaho, Dept. of Geography, 875 Perimeter Dr., Moscow, ID 83844-3021 to lease a Polar-adapted, low maintenance, Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (P-AERI) to be deployed in Eureka, Canada for the period February 1, 2006 through May 1, 2007. Collaborators from the Canadian Network for Detection of Atmospheric Change (CANDAC) Program are planning to commission an AERI-ER system from the University of Wisconsin for long term deployment in Eureka, Canada but the CANDAC system is not expected to be operational until early 2007 at the earliest. An AERI-ER system is needed to monitor crucial atmosphere/climate parameters until the CANDAC system is available and tested in Eureka. The Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (AERI) is an important instrument for Arctic research and monitoring that measure downwelling spectral infrared radiance from approximately 3 - 20 microns. AERI spectra provide information on key Arctic parameters such as cloudy conditions, fractional cloud cover, and infrared cloud radiative forcing. Furthermore, AERI spectra provide information on total column abundances of some atmospheric trace gases including H2O, CO2, O3, CH4, and HNO3, which play significant roles in climatically important processes such as the carbon and ozone cycles. The extended range AERI (AERI-ER) is particularly well suited for many of these observations because it provides both high accuracy and precision and can operate in the polar darkness when solar transmission instruments are not useful.  

The system is required to have a 1/cm resolution, a spectral range of at least 3-20 microns, a robust and documented calibration, shall operate autonomously, and be specifically adapted to operate in Polar environments. Prior successful operation in Polar conditions must be demonstrated. In addition, quality controlled data sets, containing calibrated spectral radiance measurements at the specified resolution and spectral range, must be provided to NOAA within three months of observation time.

This announcement is being issued under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures, FAR Part 13 (under $100,000). Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. Any responses shall be received in writing no later than January 9, 2006. Anticipated Award date is January 10, 2006.

<DESC>We currently anticipate awarding contracts to large and small businesses.  DFARS 219.502-1, does not permit small business set-aside acquisitions for Architect-engineer services in support of military construction or military family housing projects which exceed $300,000.  Would you be more likely to propose under a small business set-aside with a reduced scope (i.e., military construction or military family housing projects would be excluded from small business set-aside SOW), propose under the full and open competition (entire SOW scope), or ask that your proposal be considered under both competition levels? 
 
Offerors would only submit one proposal regardless of choice of competition.  Proposals would be considered for contract award under multiple competition scenarios.  Offerors would be required to clearly state their choice of competition (full and open, small business and/or 8(a)). Offerors would not be awarded more than one contract.

Please email your responses to afceeacs4pae08@brooks.af.mil no later than 14 Feb 07.  Since this is an RFI to be used in planning a future acquisition, please do not send in any proposals.  Request for proposals, if and when issued, will be available on the Internet at FedBizOpps.gov.  As such, it is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any additional information.

<DESC>An upgrade of the current Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system in use at Truman Power Plant, Stockton Power Plant, and Clarence Cannon Power Plant in Missouri to one that meets current industry standards is needed. The current syst em in use was installed in 1993 by Hewlett Packard (HP) and Computerized Process Unlimited (CPU). The Truman plant remote controls the Stockton plant, the Clarence Cannon plant, and the Clarence Cannon re-reg dam from its control room over a leased-lined c onnection. The system utilizes the HP Real Time Application Platform (RTAP) and Allen Bradley (AB) PLC5 programmable logic controllers (PLCs).  The RTAP database contains approximately 1500 points between the three plants. The upgrade is needed because th e SCADA system has become antiquated and obsolete and does not have the capabilities that are now needed. System support for software and hardware is difficult to attain.  The scope of work is for an upgrade to the existing SCADA system. The existing AB PLC5s and all the termination points will be utilized in the new system. The upgrade will include the purchase, installation, and set up of the following: new SCADA software , redundant SCADA servers, redundant operator workstations; an engineering workstation, flat panel displays, and all necessary equipment to upgrade the existing local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), and communication links between the pl cs and servers to ethernet. The setup will include all the necessary programming and work to setup the new SCADA software and to integrate the plants existing temperature recorders, SLC 5 controllers, micrologic controllers, sequence of events recorders (SER), and the Schweitzer communication processors into the system. The upgrade to the entire SCADA system should be completed at all locations under a single contract to insure compatibility and reliable interfaces.  If you have questions or is interested  in this project, please contact Monica Moody @ 816.389.3844 - Monica.Moody@us.army.mil.

This purchase will have a guaranteed minimum of 2,000 gallons with a maximum of 3,000 gallons in up to three deliveries per year.  NRCS owns 4 ea 275 Gallon totes and about 20 ea 55 Gallon Drums, which will be empty and need to be picked up at our warehouse, 463 Perimeter Way, Door 7, Troutdale, OR 97060, filled with the solution and returned.   The successful bidder may choose to deliver the product in new or used containers (totes, drums or pails) without picking the empty containers up at our warehouse beforehand, but the containers that USDA/NRCS currently owns will be accepted in trade for the new containers, and the vendor will be responsible for removing the old containers from our warehouse.  Any purchase of additional totes, drums or pails must be pre-approved by the contracting officer and be billed separately, since payment will not be handled under this contract.  Because the warehouse is unmanned, prior coordination will need to be made before each pickup and/or delivery to ensure there are employees on site.     Prior notice of 24 hours is required for each pickup and/or delivery.  The quote will include both the cost of the above listed solution and the pickup/delivery charges, and will be priced per gallon.  Quotes will be submitted on the attached ?Pricing Data? sheet.  Both Current Year and Option Year price must be quoted for quote to be considered.  Current Year and Option Year pricing will be added together to determine the best price (Evaluation of Options Clause, 52.217-5).  The Option Year funding is dependant on funds availability (Availability of Funds Clause, 52.232-18).  ?Best Value to the Government? will be determined using both price and non-price factors.  Price will be approximately 50% of the determination with the rest being (in order of importance): Past Performance w/NRCS or other USDA/Federal Entities and prior experience.  The successful bidder must be registered in CCR (Central Contractor Registration), be able to provide a DUNS (issued by Dun and Bradstreet) number and EFT information at the time of award.

<DESC>Jackson, Mississippi, New Construction, Design Phase, United States District Courthouse, Small Business Subcontracting Outreach Session.

On Monday February 26, 2007, the United States General Services Administration (GSA) will conduct a Small Business Subcontracting Outreach Session for prospective Small Business Subcontractors/Consultants for the construction phase of the new United States District Courthouse.  The Outreach Session will be conducted from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. at the Jackson State University - E-Commerce Building, 1400 John R. Lynch Street, Jackson, Mississippi.

The facility to be constructed will be occupied by the U.S. District Court, U. S. Court of Appeals, U.S. Magistrate Court, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, U.S. Attorney, U.S. Marshal Service, Circuit Library, U.S. Probation Service, U.S. Trustee, Congressional Offices, and GSA.  The Estimated Total Project Cost (ETPC) is $114,000,000 and the General Contractor (GC) W.G. Yates and Sons Construction Company is expected to be represented.

The Subcontracting Outreaching Session is intended to affirm GSA?s recognition of the talent that exists in the Small Business Community and its commitment to opening a dialogue between that community and the GC for this project.

Prospective Small Business Subcontractors/Consultants will be given an opportunity to network with the GC to showcase their special talents and abilities as qualified subcontractors/consultants.    Because GSA is not permitted by law to be a party to contractual relationships between Primes and Subcontractor/Consultants, any contracts that may develop between potential Primes and Subcontractors/Consultants as a result of the Outreaching Session will be strictly private arrangements between the interested parties based on perceived ability and need.

Questions about the Outreach Session may be directed to either David Gibson, GSA?s Small Business Outreach Specialist, Telephone (404) 331-2366, E-Mail DavidA.Gibson@GSA.GOV; or Dinora Gonzalez, GSA?s Small Business Technical Advisor, Telephone (404) 331-3031, E-Mail dinora.gonzalez@gsa.gov  or Leslie Smalls, Contracting Officer, Telephone(404) 224-2232, leslie.smalls@gsa.gov

<CONTACT>Lenny Skieff, Procurement Technician, Phone 785-823-4501, Fax 785-823-4540, Email lenny.skieff@ks.usda.gov
<DESC>CONTRACT INFORMATION:  The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) in Kansas requires the services of an Architect-Engineering (A-E) firm for performance of legal boundary surveys for the Wetlands Reserve Program easements.  This acquisition process is being conducted in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  THIS PROCUREMENT IS UNRESTRICTED and is therefore open to all businesses regardless of size.  The primary North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541330.  This announcement constitutes the only notice.

PROJECT INFORMATION:
The government contemplates the award of a firm fixed price, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract resulting from this competition.  The initial contract period will be for one year and the government may, at its option, extend the contract to a maximum of five years by exercising each of the four one-year renewal options.  Work under the contract will be subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders.  The price of any single task order shall be at least $1,000 but shall not exceed $25,000.  The maximum order amount for any contract period (base year and each option year) shall be $50,000.  There is no guaranteed minimum for the base period or option periods if exercised. 




DESCRIPTION OF WORK

Quality of Work - The WRP easement boundary description shall be clear, accurate, complete, and meet the landowner?s intent.  All work shall follow recognized professional practice and standards for legal land surveys.  The work and data presented shall be in accordance with the state of Kansas?s minimum standards for the practice of land surveying.

Notification of Intent to Survey - A preliminary title search will be provided with the task order for survey services.  Before fieldwork begins, the surveyor shall schedule with the district conservationist (DC) and landowner a date and time for conducting the survey.  Notification shall be a minimum of 72 hours prior to beginning work.  If the work is not started on the planned date, the surveyor shall notify the DC and landowner of the revised date and time that work will begin.

The NRCS WRP Program manager or District Conservationist will provide the surveyor with location maps of the WRP easement area.  The maps will include the access routes and any other description information as may be available.  Any significant (more than 5%) overage in the number of acres should be reported to the COR immediately.  The surveyor will not modify the easement area surveyed at the direction of the landowner.  

Access shall be surveyed, but no monuments are required.  The survey will show both the easement area and the ingress/egress routes to a publicly dedicated right-of-way.

Survey Area - At the site, the surveyor shall locate the boundary angle points that have been flagged or staked in the field and record the description using bearings and distances.  The boundary survey shall be a complete traverse of the area tied to a corner of a Public Land Survey or a corner of a recorded property.  A latitude and longitude coordinate shall be collected for each of the angle points using North American Datum 1983 (NAD 83) with a + 1 meter accuracy.

For each angle point and approximately every 500 feet of straight run, the surveyor shall set a steel rod driven approximately 9 inches below the ground surface with minimum dimensions of 1/2 inch in diameter and 24 inches in length.  A monument cap for each rod shall have a different point number and other required identification.  Each rod shall have a witness post set within 6 to 12 inches from the steel rod.  The witness post shall be a steel u-channel post having a minimum overall length of 7.0 feet and weighing a minimum of 1.125 pounds per foot.  The witness posts shall be embedded to a depth of 2 feet below ground surface.  Wherever possible, the witness 
 
posts shall be placed on the easement side of the monument rods.  To facilitate identification, each witness post shall have an easement boundary sign attached.  (The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) shall furnish the WRP boundary signs.  The surveyor will be required to pick up the WRP boundary signs form the local NRCS office.  The surveyor shall furnish the witness posts.  Witness posts shall have the top 6? painted fluorescent orange.  Boundary signs shall be fastened to the top of the witness posts by using zinc coated bolts and fasteners.) 

Some easement boundaries may be a river or a stream.  In those cases, the easement boundary will be determined on a case by case basis.  In some cases the boundary may be to the middle of the stream, in other cases the edge of the upper stream bank will be considered the easement boundary.  An on-site clarification of this boundary shall be determined by the surveyor, DC, and landowner(s).  A description point shall be included for the stream or river boundary intersection points.  An offset point shall be established on each boundary line intersecting the stream or river boundary.  The offset point shall have a permanent marker, whereas the stream or river boundary intersection point may not.  The offset and the permanent markers would allow for a visual marker on the ground for use in maintaining the boundary integrity.  Visibility and potential stream encroachment shall be factors in locating the offset.  The offset distance shall be in whole feet.

Excluded areas within the main boundary area shall be surveyed as described above.  All private/ public roads (and associated roadway easements) should be excluded from the main WRP boundary area.  The net WRP easement area shall be reported by the surveyor and computed by subtracting the excluded areas from the main boundary area.  The net WRP easement area shall be computed to the nearest tenth of an acre.

The boundary description shall include a delineated route of ingress/egress.  The ingress/egress route to the WRP easement area will be described in the survey plat.

When the boundary survey is complete, the DC, and the landowner, will review the survey and ensure that   (1) the area delineated with permanent markers was the area that the landowner intended to place under easement and (2) permanent markers have been installed as required.  If a discrepancy is identified the surveyor will be required to meet with the DC and landowner to reconcile the difference. 

Presentation of Survey - A scaled drawing of the metes and bounds area shall be prepared identifying the angle points, straight line run monuments set distance and bearing between angle points, and distance and bearing to the legal survey point.  The survey shall show the following:

	A North Arrow
The legal description
	Graphic scale
A scaled drawing of the metes and bounds area shall be prepared identifying the angle points, distance and bearing between angle points and distance and bearing to the legal survey point -

Latitude and longitude for the point of beginning shall be documented on the survey drawing.
	The ingress/egress route to the WRP easement area will be described in the survey and shown on the survey plat.

<DESC>The U.S. Air Force Surgeon Generals (AF/SG) mission is to develop and implement medical programs and policies that provide for the health care of active duty and retired military personnel and their family members.  AF/SG optimizes Air Force readiness potential to support national security strategies and defines and disseminates health care policy in support of the 42,000 personnel of the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS), the 20,000 members assigned to the AF Reserves and the Air National Guard, and 74 medical treatment facilities (MTFs).  In addition, AF/SG ensures a quality, cost-effective, prevention-based health care continuum for 2.4 million beneficiaries worldwide.  The AF/SG serves as the functional manager of the AFMS.  In this capacity, AF/SG advises the Secretary of the Air Force and Air Force Chief of Staff, as well as the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, on matters pertaining to the medical aspects of the air expeditionary force and the health of Air Force personnel.  The AF/SG has the authority to commit resources worldwide for the AFMS, to make decisions affecting the delivery of medical services, and to develop plans, programs and procedures to support worldwide medical service missions.  The Office of Headquarters, U.S. Air Force Surgeon General, Modernization Directorate (HQ AF/SGR), is charged with identifying shortfalls within the current health delivery system and planning, programming, budgeting, and fielding the technology and services required to surmount that shortfall.  
The scope of this effort encompasses identification, exploration, demonstration, and validation of new, advanced diagnostic technologies in realistic scenarios.  Research program areas focus on specialized medical materiel or procedures designed to enhance force health protection, restore health, prevent casualties, and maintain a fit and healthy force.  The scope of this effort and the priorities attached to specific projects are influenced by changes in military and civilian medical science and technology, operational requirements, military threat assessments, and national defense strategies. The extramural research and development program plays a vital role in the fulfillment of the objectives established by the AFMS. 
This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is intended to solicit research ideas, and is issued under the provisions of the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-369), as implemented in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  This Announcement provides a general description of AFMS research programs, including specific areas of interest, general information, the evaluation and selection criteria, and proposal instructions.  The Appendices include forms that are required with the submission of a full proposal.  Research proposals are sought from educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, private industry, and military organizations.  This announcement is open from 7 Feb 2007 through 7 May 2007.  Pre-proposals may be submitted and will be evaluated during this open period, unless otherwise noted or stated in a separate announcement.  Unsolicited proposals can be received at any time per FAR 15.6.

The AFDW/A7KM has contractual responsibility for the BAA as advertised under FEDBIZOPPS.  The BAA will be revised as other internal Air Force electronic processes are developed.  Amendments will be advertised in FEDBIZOPPS (www.fedbizopps.gov).  From time-to-time separate announcements or calls for proposals may supplement this BAA. 

SEE ATTACHED DOCUMENTS BAA 07-01 GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS AND BAA 07-01 APPENDICES FOR FURTHER INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS ON SUBMITTING PRE-PROPOSALS.  PRE-PROPOSALS MUST BE SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPENDIX 1 OR THEY WILL NOT BE EVALUATED BY THE GOVERNMENT.

    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held? 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock;

The D Street Gate Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point (CVIP) is open 0530 - 1330 Monday through Friday (closed weekends and holidays.

During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through t he Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate.  All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gat e or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes.

Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week.  Co ntractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Installation Visitor Center located near the Main (Liberty) Gate.  Contractors operating a commercial vehicle may obtain a 1-day pass at either the Logistics Center Gate or the D Street Gate when those gates are operational.

If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access ide ntification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee.  If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, d ecide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.  c.

If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, f ollowed up in writing the next work day.  An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/she does not have the required identification badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of th is contract.  The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contractor.

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to:

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i)entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

ATTACHMENT 2

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-12
HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

FAR Clause 52.204-9	Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

As prescribed in 4.1301, insert the following clause: 
Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Nov. 2006) 
(a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, as amended, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, as amended.
(b) The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. 
(End of clause)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) (September 2006)

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems.  USAID will begin issuing HSPS-12 "smart card" IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach.  Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new "smart card" IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems.  USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007.  (Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to October 27, 2007.  In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.)

Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC* or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo.  One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.)  USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer.  Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAID's information systems.  All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing.  The contractor or his/her Facility Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.

The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPS-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures.  This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/W and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office.

In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and the later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the most recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer.

The contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems.
