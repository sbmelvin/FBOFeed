<DESC>This requirement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation and an award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.
This combined synopsis/solicitation is notice that the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has issued a request for a non-personal services contract to provide experienced timber marker(s)/personnel for 120 marker days to assist our forestry staff with selectively marking bottomland hardwoods for thinning to meet goals and objectives within delineated sections (approximately 15 acres of forests) on the White River National Wildlife Refuge (NWR/Refuge) that ranges from the vicinity of Clarendon, Arkansas (AR) southerly to Tichnor, AR or Snow Lake, AR.  Refuge Foresters shall instruct and guide the timber markers so the markers can replicate the marking done by Refuge Foresters.  Species consist mostly of Nuttall, overcup, and willow oaks, sugarberry, ash, bitter pecan, American and cedar elm ranging from 8 dbh to over 40 dbh.  The principles of Desired Forest Conditions (DFCs) as detailed in Restoration, Management, and Monitoring of Forest Resources in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley: Recommendations for Enhancing Wildlife Habitat, Wilson, et al, 2007, will be the basis of the thinning.  An electronic copy of this publication can be provided to the marker(s) via CD or other media.  The Contractor is solely responsible for acquiring and maintaining all federal and local licenses, certification, and permits as required.  The Contractor shall provide all personnel, labor (i.e. markers), equipment, supplies, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and other non-personal services necessary to perform the requirements (i.e. tree count and cruise data) of this contract order and shall plan, schedule, coordinate, and ensure effective performance of required services for the entire duration of contract.  The marker(s) will provide their own tree marking equipment, such as a Panama backpack sprayer, ACMI handgun, or other suitable sprayer in the judgment of the Supervisory Forester.  The Refuge will supply all tree marking ink.  The marker(s) will supply other tree marking equipment required, such as a sounding hammer or hatchet, and Biltmore stick or other measuring device satisfactory to the Supervisory Forester.  The period of performance shall be for 120 days beginning on or about September 2012 thru October 2012 and July 2013 thru August 2013.  If river levels allow, marking may be conducted during November 2012 thru June 2013.  All work must be completed by September 2013.  The Technical Site Representative contact is/are Jeff Denman (870/282-8248 or jeff_denman@fws.gov) or Ron Hollis (870/282-8236 or ron_hollis@fws.gov).
