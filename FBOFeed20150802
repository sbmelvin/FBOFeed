<DESC>The contractor shall provide all materials and services necessary to provide the following Communications on the Move requirement. <br />USARJ and I Corps (Forward) provides strategic and tactical Signal capabilities in support of PACOM, I Corps, USARPAC, USFK and USFJ missions, priorities and objectives. While postured to provide Pacific Land War Net systems in support of PACOM OPLANs and CONPLANs, the interoperability between U.S. Army Radios and those of the Japan Ground Self Defense Force (JGSDF) is non-existent in the secure domain.<br />USARJ and I Corps (Forward) require a(n) interface that would allow secure tactical radio communications between both (U.S. and Japan) Armies utilizing pre-existing combat net radio infrastructure. This would allow the U.S. Army to continue utilizing encrypted, frequency hop capability with common/standardized tactical radio systems employed by the majority of U.S. military units with the Japanese secure radio systems commonly used by Japanese units. This would greatly enhance USARJ's solution for initial entry communications capability for short/no-notice Humanitarian Assistance Disaster Relief (HADR) and contingency missions.<br />Note 1: This project will be performed in its entirety in the country of Japan. The successful offeror must be licensed and registered to perform work in the country of Japan. <br />Note 2: Solicitation issuance and closing dates are tentative. It is the offeror's responsibility to check the firm dates at block 6 &amp; 8 of SF 1449, once the solicitation is released, to ensure submission of your offer in a timely manner. If you have any questions about the release date of a solicitation please contact the Contract Administrator or Contracting Officer listed in this announcement.<br />

We will award Mahidol University as sole source contractor. Nature of this contract is a grant rather than a normal contract. Initially, we tried to make a grant IAW 10.U.S.C. 2358 and 31 U.S.C. 6304. However, we found out that our contract writing system at overseas did not allow making a grant.

<DESC>PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT

A.	PURPOSE. 

The Supported Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) program is required to collect and analyze customer satisfaction. The vendor selected will support SSVF in collecting and analyzing this customer satisfaction data.

B.	BACKGROUND.

This program is authorized by 38 U.S.C. 2044 and implemented by final rule, promulgating 38 CFR part 62 (RIN 2900-AN53) regulations implementing 38 U.S.C. 2044 by establishing an SSVF Program.75 FR 68979. Through this program, VA has offered grants to eligible entities, identified in the regulations, that provide supportive services to very low income veterans and families who are at risk for becoming homeless or who, in some cases, have recently become homeless. The SSVF program was authorized by Public Law 110-387 which defines a very low-income veteran family as a veteran who is a single person or a family in which the head of household, or the spouse of the head of household is a Veteran with an income below 50 percent of the area median income.  

VA's goals and objectives for SSVF include the provision of supportive services designed to enhance the housing stability and independent living skills of very low-income veteran families occupying permanent housing nationwide.  At a minimum, grantees will be expected to provide the following supportive services to program participants: outreach services, case management services, housing counseling services, help with financial planning and credit counseling, assistance in obtaining VA benefits, assistance in obtaining child care services, assistance in obtaining legal assistance, assistance in obtaining transportation, and assistance in obtaining and coordinating other public benefits.  

As part of the SSVF's program authorization, it is required to produce a report analyzing program effectiveness. This report must include a section on consumer satisfaction.

C.	TASKS AND ASSOCIATED DELIVERABLES.

The contractor will be work with the program office and grantees to develop consumer satisfaction data. This   consumer data must be collected electronically to meet the following objectives:  

"	Significantly reduce SSVF administrative time requirements and costs.
"	Increases the survey response rate to improve date validity and value of client feedback.
"	Reduce the lag time between survey responses and when that information is compiled and made available to SSVF Grantees.
"	Ensure that Veterans/families without a permanent home or any email address have the ability to easily provide feedback on SSVF Grantee services.
"	Provide monthly reporting that is oriented towards both measurement and improvement - rather than the current practice of providing measurement-oriented-only annual reporting. To this end, contractor will provide information directly to Grantees for the Veterans they serve and roll-up reporting for the SSVF.
"	Place a minimal time and financial burden on the Grantees to achieve the above objectives.

o	Ensures that participants can complete surveys anonymously. 
"	Design and develop, with input from SSVF, and support from the contractor, the following SSVF-branded tools to collect SSVF Grantee client feedback:
o	One standardized survey that allows for delineation those veterans/families that were homeless or at risk of homelessness and the Grantee that provided service.
o	A website for Grantees for the purpose of capturing client email addresses and other relevant information to the contractor's ability to collect satisfaction data.
o	A client survey invitation card, with instructions for providing web-based feedback, including a unique identifier for each client (SSVF is responsible for any printing/distribution of these to Grantees - unless the scope of this services proposal is modified).
"	Design and automate all reports for the Grantees and the SSVF

Task 2: Ongoing Operations and Support
Contractor will provide the following services for the contract period
"	Contractor software use license and date hosting for the services described.
"	Automated reporting delivered via email based on the schedule, form, and format defined by SSVF, for SSVF and the Grantees.
"	Provide SSVF participants with a survey invitation that reinforces the importance of providing feedback on Grantee services and simple instructions for doing so, including accessing a website for this purpose along with a unique identifier that does not include Veteran's name  (identifier must include key demographic information and ensures no more than one completed survey from that client).
"	A complete dataset of patient feedback for analysis and ad hoc reporting for SSVF and a subset of that information for each Grantee produced each month.
"	Contractor service intervention eAlerts that would immediately notify the Grantee of any issue that would require immediate follow-up with the client.
"	All technical operations for the Contractor scope described above including delivery of reports on the schedule as designed (Grantees are responsible for assuring web access)

<p>GROTE INDUSTRIES INC DBA 81834 P/N 62571 <br />NAVISTAR DEFENSE LLC DBA 338X5 P/N 3688771C1</p>
<p align="left">The ADQ represents an estimated quantity only and is not a guaranteed amount. Multiple delivery orders may be written against the basic contract for a maximum of&nbsp;3 years. Solicitation is a Unrestricted. Various incremental quantities will be solicited. Deliveries will be to various DLA Direct locations within the Continental United States (CONUS) and outside the Continental United States (OCONUS).

<p align="left">The Contracting Officer MAY utilize online Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under the solicitation. During the course of the online auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the online auction.

By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in a Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An&nbsp; offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and their final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p align="left">Solicitation issue date is&nbsp;August 2, 2015&nbsp;and the response date is&nbsp;August 17, 2015.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
