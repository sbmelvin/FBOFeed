This competitive procurement will be conducted under the authority of FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health (NIH) has a requirement for the Development of the NIH Toolbox for Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function.  The Contractor shall assist in the development of the NIH Toolbox for Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function.  This toolbox is to provide investigators with a brief, but comprehensive, measurement tool for assessment of cognitive, emotional, sensory and motor function of participants in large cohort studies such as epidemiological studies, clinical studies, or clinical trials.  The work under this contract shall include: 1) Development of a core set of tasks that will address the domains of cognitive, emotional, sensory, and motor function.  2) Integration of specific characteristics in the NIH Toolbox for Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function: Multidimensional - Should include multiple constructs within each of the domains of cognitive, motor, sensory and emotional function. Versatile - The assessment method should be capable of monitoring neurological and behavioral health status and function over time (as in longitudinal epidemiological studies) as well as evaluating effectiveness of interventions and treatments (as in clinical trials).  Ceiling and floor effects should be considered.  The measures should be modular and readily portable from one type of study design to another.  Where psychometrically feasible, the method should incorporate ways to ‘crosswalk’ to existing and previous studies through the use of embedded benchmark items. This would eventually allow the mapping of a smaller set of test items back to a unifying latent construct where a common metric can be used across measures.  Brief - All efforts should be taken to ensure low respondent burden.  Methodologically sound - The measures should demonstrate validity and reliability.  State-of-the-art - Development of the assessment method and measures should employ modern psychometric approaches to the measurement of latent dimensions, e.g., item response theory models and computer-adaptive testing, to the extent relevant.  Diverse - The assessments should have known measurement properties across cultures and age ranges.  English and Spanish versions should be developed and validated in culturally and geographically diverse groups.  Dynamic - It will be strongly encouraged that the assessment method be dynamic, i.e., capable of being adapted over time in response to advances in science and/or advances in technology.  Measures should be employed that are internally flexible, e.g., adaptive testing.  The instrument should demonstrate sensitivity to change over time.  The NIH is seeking an innovative approach to measurement that will be responsive to the needs of researchers in a variety of settings, with a particular emphasis on measuring outcomes in clinical trials and functional status in large cohort studies, e.g. epidemiological studies and longitudinal studies.  Determining criteria for acceptability to the behavioral and neurological research communities prior to specific domain task development and evaluating the acceptability to researchers of the final instrument will be essential to successful completion of these goals. The tasks will be structured in two phases.  Phase I will encompass qualitative research focusing on the identification of content area and the development of domain specific tasks.  Phase II addresses the formal testing and refining of the final toolbox of tests.  RFP 260-06-01 WILL BE AVAILABLE 15 DAYS AFTER ISSUANCE OF THIS SYNOPSIS AND WILL BE POSTED ON THIS WEBSITE.  OFFERORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ROUTINELY CHECKING THIS WEBSITE FOR ANY SOLICITATION AMENDMENTS THAT MAY BE ISSUED.  NO INDIVIDUAL NOTIFICATION OF ANY AMENDMENTS WILL BE PROVIDED.  Proposals will be due 45 days after issuance of the solicitation.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the Government.   No collect calls will be accepted.

The objective of this program, Infrastructure for Income, is to increase rural income by generating employment opportunities through small scale infrastructure projects, green roads, and fish ponds. During this nine month extension, the program will continue to use labor intensive low technology approaches to provide jobs for poor Nepalese. During this extension it is anticipated that 11 new work orders with an estimated combined cost of $1 million will be issued. These work orders will be for construction of green roads, mule trails, fish ponds and a drinking water project in rural and some times conflict-affected areas. These activities are expected to provide approximately $560,000 in wages to rural Nepalese caught up in conflict who would otherwise have little or no alternative source of income.

<ARCHDATE>04302006
<CONTACT>Michael Walz, (609) 485-8493
<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) TCBAA-06-000R Advanced Power Distribution 1.	Background With the increase use of electronic monitoring, airframe power designers are exploring new methods of power distribution and continuous monitoring. Some of the new methods are distributed power (no load center) and continual load data monitoring. These new power distributions systems have the ability to monitor current and voltage information in real time on any specific load. These systems will also be able to re route power based on load shedding abilities and to work around a perceived damage. The effects of the changes will be reduced power conductor bundles, reduced weight, and shorter power runs.  Arc Fault and ground fault technologies have been successfully integrated into aircraft circuit protection in the form of advanced circuit breakers. In addition to circuit breakers, many other power control devices upstream in the power distribution also provide the safe distribution of electrical energy. Contactors, remote controlled circuit breakers, and power control relays, are a sampling of devices that perform critical power control functions.  Solid-State technologies can aid on the implementation of these functions to provide a safe distribution of power to the EWIS 2.	Purpose The purpose of this BAA is to study power distribution monitoring and develop guidelines of common format of data that can be retained from the power distribution system.  This shall include a common format for prognostics algorithms.  Study the ability to safely switch power from one conductor to another and define the criteria for switch matrix power distribution systems.  Study the effects of these changes on EWIS and the advantages and disadvantages of decentralized power.  Develop solid-state technology to include updated arc fault interruption and ground fault interruption, on power control devices in order to afford increased levels of wire protection.  The protection shall be able mitigate damage due to arc faults, bolted faults, high contact resistance, intermittent shorts., and mitigate damage due to loose terminals.  Shall have immunity to false tripping on normal and abnormal aircraft conditions.  Shall communicate identified problems and provide override functions.  Furthermore study and implement faster reaction times, greater diagnostics abilities, and methods to achieve trip coordination with other arc fault and ground fault protection devices installed upstream or downstream in the distribution.  The technology shall be develop for retrofit applications. 3.	Submission Deadlines Formal Proposals (see section 4) prepared in accordance with this synopsis will be accepted through 30 of March 2006 or until fiscal year 2006 funding for this effort is committed, whichever occurs first.   4.	Submission Requirements Offerors shall submit the Formal Proposal electronically via Email as well as a hardcopy by Mail to: William J. Hughes Technical Center Code AAR-480 (Attn: M. Walz) Atlantic City Int'l Airport, NJ 08405 The electronic version of the proposal will be emailed to Michael.Walz@FAA.gov.  The electronic version shall be provided in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat format. The proposal shall address the requirements described in the 'Formal Proposal Requirements' section of this announcement. 5.	Formal Proposal Requirements  a.	The offerors shall specify a plan into research of power distribution monitoring, the ability to safely switch power from one conductor to another for switch matrix power distribution systems, and the effects of these systems on the EWIS and circuit protection. b.	The offerers proposal shall contain specific and detailed performance specifications for the proposed system. c.	Offerors shall propose to develop a prototype device with the specifications identified.  For the purposes of preparing the proposal and cost estimate, the prototype shall become the property of the FAA at the conclusion of the program. d.	Offerors shall prepare an implementation and technology transfer plan, describing how the proposed technology will be developed into commercial products.  e.	The proposal shall identify all areas risk related to development, implementation, and technology transfer, of the proposed system, technology, or technique.  The proposal shall include mitigating strategies for each risk area.  Proposals that do not identify risk areas will be considered non-developmental in nature and therefore outside the scope of this research program.  Implementation risks are associated with logistical issues, missing/inadequate support infrastructure, etc. f.	Offerors shall include in their proposals a detailed cost proposal.  In-house funding, cost matching, services-in-kind, will be identified in the cost proposal as necessary.  All manpower related to double blind testing and validation shall also be provided.   6.	Method of Evaluation  Proposals will be evaluated in the seven technical areas listed in order of decreasing importance: a.	Technical merit. b.	Utility to the aviation community. c.	Investigative team competency and experience. d.	Logical and effective validation strategy. e.	Technical risks and implementation risks, and the mitigation plan for each. f.	Availability and quality of equipment and facilities. g.	Effective project management plan. Cost and cost realism will be evaluated as acceptable or unacceptable only.  Acceptable proposals will have costs commensurate with the work load proposed and will not be in excess of  $400,000 in any fiscal year.   7.	Period of Performance:  Efforts lasting between one to three years will be considered.  Multiyear efforts will be funded in yearly increments, providing measurable and adequate performance is shown prior to each new funding increment.

<DESC>P4R1 Loopback Test Capability
(22 Feb 06)

Range Instrumentation Systems Squadron, Air Combat Support Systems Group, Air Armament Center (AAC), Eglin Air Force Base (AFB), Florida, plans to award a sole source contract to DRS Technologies Inc. (DRS), 645 Anchors Street, Ft. Walton Beach FL 32548, to improve the current P4R1 pod Advanced Digital Interface Unit’s (ADIU) ability to detect internal 1553 communication abnormalities during built-in-test (BIT).  Currently the ADIU design masks operational problems and precludes collection of mission data to support critical air combat training.  This award will result in a pre-mission test capability to ensure the pod’s internal 1553 communications interface is functioning properly prior to loading the pod on an aircraft. This effort is being called P4R1 Loopback Test Capability. It is anticipated that approximately eleven (11) loopback test kits will be needed for delivery to ten (10) CONUS locations. Delivery requirements also include initial kit verification and an associated Technical Data Package.  The P4R1 pod was designed and manufactured by DRS.  The Government does not own the pod internal interface drawings, the ADIU drawings or the resident ADIU software code.  Availability of these assets will be essential to a cost-effective solution to provide the required loopback test capability. Due to DRS’s ownership of these assets, and their detailed design, manufacturing and operational knowledge of the P4R1 ADIU, DRS is uniquely capable of meeting the Government’s technical requirements in a timely manner within the limited funding available for this effort.  Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should be addressed to the Contracting Officer, Mrs. Karen S. Turner, karen.turner@eglin.af.mil , telephone (850) 883-3404, FAX (850) 883-3226. or Contacting Specialist, Erik Urban, erik.urban@eglin.af.mil, telephone (850) 883-3420.  Technical questions should be directed to the Program Manager, SMSgt Michael Bennett, michael.bennett@eglin.af.mil, telephone (850) 883-3416.  Notes 22 and 26 apply.

<DESC>The Maneuvering and Control Division, Code 5600, of the Carderock Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWCCD) has been tasked to measure the Newport News Experimental Model (NNEMO) non-body forces and moments in steady and unsteady wind tunnel maneuvers. In support of this effort, NSWCCD intends to negotiate with only one source and award a firm-fixed price purchase order  using Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Virginia Polytechnic Institute (VPI).  VPI has the necessary facilities, expertise, and tools required to meet the governments requirement. This task will require the use of the unique VPI Dynamic Plunge-Pitch-Roll Apparatus (DyPPiR) tool for wind tunnel testing. Professor Roger L. Simpson of Virginia Polytechnic Institute (VPI) has for over 35 years focused on measurement and calculation of separation turbulent flows, both with 2-D and 3-D cases under both steady and unsteady conditions.  He has supervised the design and development of the Dynamic Plunge, Pitch and Roll (DyPPiR) actuator with the associated special measurement technologies for forces and moments, surface pressure and skin friction. Kenneth Granlund is a graduate student enrolled in the PhD program at VPI.  He has developed the software procedures for extracting low-uncertainty force and moment data for unsteady wind tunnel testing with the DyPPiR. All responsible sources submitting offers will be considered.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties may forward capabilities statements to the POC (hugh.harrison@navy.mil) no later than 2/11/2006.

The pressure sensors (kulites) that have been mounted into model airfoil surfaces are at locations from the leading-edge to the trailing edges for the airfoil without interfering with the true airfoil surface.	The airfoils instrumented with kulites have and will be used to obtain unsteady pressure measurements in the QFF for airframe noise studies.  The kulites being requested are in addition to other pressure sensors already being used within the QFF.  Utilization of the same pressure transducers allows for seamless integration into data acquisition system and processing software.  If sensors other than kulites are purchased this would require modification and additional resources (additional cost and workforce) to integrage into existing laboratory equipment and data reduction software. The kulies are also required because of their small size and high frequency response.  They have no pressure reference tube and thus measure the total pressure signal, not just the mean or dynamic pressure.  The enclosure for the pressure sensor diaphram also is specially designed to enclose only that region directly above the cavity which feeds into the tube for mounting.	This design ensures that the cavity helmhotz frequency is at its highest level.	The QFF is supporting a number of focused and base programs concerning airframe noise and its control.  The measurements obtained through the sue of the sensors are necessary to determine the surface response of the unsteady flow responsible for airframe noise.  The measurements provide information necessary to meet current and future milestones and objectives with respect to identifying, predicting, and controlling key noise producing flow field structure.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 3, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has baselined the use of a lower cost version of the Space Shuttle Main Engine as the Core Stage Engine (CSE) for the proposed Cargo Launch Vehicle (CaLV). At this time, special studies are needed to evaluate and assess the processes and requirements necessary to develop and certify the CSE for the CaLV. The Core Stage Engine will be a highly affordable, expendable engine derived from the current Space Shuttle Main Engine (RS-25).  Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the special studies effort from Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne (PWR), Inc., 6633 Canoga Avenue, Canoga Park, California, 91309-7922. The Rocketdyne organization, now a division of PWR, has designed and developed the RS-25 engine and has been responsible for its production, refurbishment, and improvements since 1972. Consequently, PWR is the only company that has the requisite expertise to perform these special studies, which are a follow-on to the development work they have been doing on the RS-25 engine.   The current special studies requirement does not encompass the full design, development, test, and evaluation (DDT&E) phase or the production effort on the CSE for the CaLV.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 10, 2006. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>The Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) Joint Program Office, Air to Ground Munition System Wing, (AGMSW)/DASG, Eglin AFB, Florida, intends to issue a contract or contract modification to the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of The Boeing Company, for integrating onto the F/A-18 aircraft (but not limited to F/A-18) a non-developmental laser seeker kit that is field-installable on a MK-82 warhead integrated with a standard JDAM GBU-38 tail kit.  This effort is in response to the warfighters’ urgent need for an affordable, precision dual-mode (GPS/INS and laser) JDAM capability to enhance operational performance and mission flexibility when GPS target coordinates are not available.  This effort includes integration of the laser-modified JDAM (Laser JDAM) on the F/A-18 and integration-related support, procurement of test assets through completion of Laser JDAM integration and production estimated through FY09.  This effort is anticipated to be awarded under a single contract with Cost Plus Fixed Fee for integration and testing support, and Firm Fixed Price production of the laser seeker kit.  The Boeing Company is the current JDAM prime contractor, and has sole responsibility for design and warranty of the JDAM weapon system.  Boeing is not required to furnish a technical data package to the Systems Program Office, and therefore a data package is not available.  The scope of this effort shall include procurement of the test and integration hardware/software such as: separation, guided, and instrumented test vehicles, laser kits, telemetry kits, tooling and factory test equipment, weapon trainers, laser kit containers, logistics support and analysis, together with technical support for the actual planning, conduct, analysis and documentation of the Government evaluation effort and resolution of resulting issues.  Direct all questions and routine communication concerning this acquisition to Ms. Sallye Belton, (850) 882- 3525 ext 3070.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns relating to this acquisition.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather the Contracting Officer, Contract Specialist, or the Program Manager previously identified.  For any other concerns, interested parties may call the Air Armament Center Ombudsman,  Mr. Dennis Love at (850) 882-0312, AAC/XP, 101 West D Avenue, Suite 131, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-5495.

Testbase software allows you to quickly retrieve manageable subsets of referentially intact data from DB2 databases around the enterprise, thoroughly test and validate proper functioning of all DB2 application enhancements, and to ensure that all sensitive production data remains completely private during testing.  It is used to significantly reduce the time to set up and validate DB2 applications. The vendor (Softbase Systems, Inc.) owns all proprietary rights to the software's source code.  The vendor is the only responsible sole source for maintenance support, upgrades, update and fixes; no other source can maintain the software or provide the relevant software upgrades. 
<P>
The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed purchase order for the maintenance and software license upgrades. Other organizations possessing the requisite expertise and resources are invited to submit information concerning their capabilities, expertise, and other pertinent data. Pricing data may be submitted. Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement. This is not a request for quotation and the Government does not intend to pay for information received. If SSA does not identify other acceptable sources capable of providing the software maintenance and relevant upgrades, SSA shall issue a sole source award under FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures for the period of 02/27/06 through 02/26/07. Responses to this notice should be submitted by Noon on February 27th, 2006. Request for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged. Oral communications are not acceptable.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Since the forward portion of the  SlingAssembly may come into contact with a hot barrel this portion shall be  constructed of high temperature, heat resistant material to prolong the service  life of the Sling Assembly.  No deviations to the drawing materials, treatment, or finish will be  permitted.  The contractor shall fabricate the item in accordance with the  provided drawings,inspect them in accordance with drawing Quality Assurance  Provisions (QAP),and package them in accordance with the Special Packaging  Instructions (SPI).

<DESC>Notice of Intent to negotiate a sole source contract with Makah Tribe for NOAA, Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary to: 

 Develop Geographic Response Plan improvements to reduce injury to resources of concern to the Makah and sanctuary.  This includes providing updates to the Northwest Area Contingency Plan to integrate tribal participation in response management and participating in the Northwest Area Contingency Plan and Geographic Response Plan working groups.  

Build Makah internal capacity and technical expertise in emergency preparedness to advance their response readiness. This includes participating in training and exercises, building internal and external communication procedures, and developing protocols among state, federal, and tribal agencies for natural resource damage assessment.

Develop scientific information for preparedness to improve decision making for future incidents by advancing our understanding of risks and improving decisions on resource trade-offs during response. This includes participating in a Makah-NOAA working group to explore scientific training, technical analysis, and emergency response opportunities, identify areas for collaboration or coordination, and discuss developments in emergency preparedness.

Provide liaison services to the sanctuary. Arrange for appropriate level meetings between the sanctuary and the Makah tribe to discuss emergency preparedness issues.  When appropriate and desired by the Makah Tribe and the sanctuary meetings may be necessary to discuss the development of positions on issues of common interest. The period of performance is March 2006 through March 2007. The Sanctuary's relationship with federally recognized tribes is unique within the National Marine Sanctuary Program. The trust responsibility of the sanctuary, as an agency of the U.S. Federal Government, to the Marah, Quileute, and Hoh tribes and Quinault Indian Nation is (in part) articulated in several judicial decisions, sanctuary regulations and in Executive Order 13175 of November 6, 2000, Consulation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments and the Treaty of Neah Bay from 1855.

This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000

<DESC>The Federal Railroad Administration’s Office of Research and Development conducts a variety of research programs for improving rail transportation efficiency and safety.  Frequently, these programs are derived from short-term reactive conditions requiring the research to be performed as expeditiously as possible.  FRA’s intent is to award a Multiple Schedule IDIQ contract to 2 or more vendors in fulfilling these stated requirements.   This proposed acquisition is intended as a mechanism for providing timely responses in such instances, as well as to provide a mechanism for the support of programmed research.  As discrete research requirements are defined, individual task orders will be established under this contract to address specific research needs.  General topic areas which may be included in a task are: Railroad Vehicles; Non-electric Motive Power and Components: Hazardous Materials Transportation by Railroad; Railroad Operating Practices; Human Factors; Railroad Track, Structures and Components; Track-Train Interaction; Passenger and Freight Operations; Advanced Rail Systems Technology, including Positive Train Control; Railroad Signal, Communication, Control and Electric Traction Power.  Individual task orders may involve one or more of the above areas.  In the past, Human Factors Engineering has represented at least 20% of the overall effort of the contract.  It is estimated that roughly 36,000 labor hours of effort at an estimated cost of $5,000,000 will be required over the 3-year period of the contract term.  The RFP will also contain 2 optional years requiring roughly 10,000 labor hours per year.  The solicitation will be issued electronically using Fed Biz Ops on February 21, 2006.  No written copies will be available.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought announcement only.  This synopsis is issued for the sole purpose of the 55th Contracting Squadron to conduct Market Research in accordance with FAR Part 10.  

GENERAL DESCRIPTION:  This effort is to seek qualified sources capable of providing engineering and technical services for maintenance and  development of enhancements to the Air Vehicle Planning System (APS) application for United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), Mobile Consolidated Command Center (MCCC), and DET 1, 608TH Air Operations Group (AOG).  APS is an air vehicle mission-planning tool with a graphical user interface and database (i.e. uses USSTRATCOM’s Enterprise Database (EDB)) capable of planning the air vehicle missions supporting USSTRATCOM and United States Air Force missions.  A sample of the air vehicles included are the B-52, B-1, and B-2 bombers; KC-135 and KC-10 tankers; U-2, EP-3, and RC-135C reconnaissance aircraft; Dual-Capable F-15 and F-16 aircraft; Air Launched Cruise Missiles; Advanced Cruise Missiles; and Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missiles.  APS’ approximate 6.5 million lines of software code have been developed in languages such as FORTRAN, C, and C++.  The size of the database is approximately one terabyte.  APS provides interactive graphical displays supporting air vehicle routing; route conflict resolutions, reconnaissance objective acquisition analysis, threat and weapon effect analysis, and timing plan development.  APS interfaces with the Air Force Mission Support System (AFMSS), Mission Data Planning System (MDPS), and other USSTRATCOM and/or Joint systems.  The possible (or potential) enhancements are not limited to the following: improvement by modernizing and upgrading the software per the USSTRATCOM System and Technical Architecture Documents; migration toward a thin client environment; support for Theater Planning; EDB updates; re-engineering to reduce legacy languages (i.e. PL/1); improve performance of the application; modernization and integration with other Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) Sub-Systems, transition planning functions to other DoD systems (i.e. Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS)) and increase inter-operability with current and future mission planning systems. Contractor personnel who work on APS must posses and maintain a favorable SSBI within the past five years for TOP SECRET and specific SAR clearances and be cleared for SIOP/ESI and Special Compartmentalized Information (SCI) access.  The contractor must possess and maintain a TOP SECRET and Special Access Required (SAR) facility clearance with storage capacity for TOP SECRET and SAR documents and equipment.

<DESC>2006 Design-Bid-Build Brussels Chancery Renovation and Rehabilitation Project

CHANCERY RENOVATION  QUALIFICATION ONLY 

THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE (DOS), Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO) is seeking to pre-qualify firms for Design-Bid-Build construction services for the renovation of an existing office building, Bi-lateral Mission Chancery, Brussels, Belgium. The construction contract is expected to be awarded prior to September 30, 2006. Actually, construction is not expected to begin until issuance of a Notice to Proceed. Performance period of this project from Notice to Proceed issuance is anticipated to be 18 months. This project does require the use of cleared American workers. The contract type for this project will be firm fixed-price. Award of this contract is subject to the availability of funds. 



SALMEC-06-R0038: Brussels, Belgium, Chancery Renovation and Rehabilitation: 6,000 gsm, Estimated Bid Build cost range $10 to $15 million.


Background Information

This US Government owned Chancery, constructed by the Department in 1952 is situated on a one-third acre lot.  The 6,000 gsm Chancery is comprised of a seven-story "tower" portion on Boulevard du Regent and a two-story back wing which abuts the CMR. The building forms a "U" shape around a paved interior courtyard and a full basement extends under the entire floor plate of the building including the tower, low wing and courtyard.  This level was originally constructed as a parking garage; evidence of the irregular column spacing and ramps still exist.  A sub-basement was built under the tower portion of the building, which is comprised of the building's mechanical services.

The entire building, with the exception of the top floor was constructed with cast-in-place concrete columns, beams, joists, floor and roof slabs.  The top floor of the tower is framed with structural steel, which is roofed with a concrete slab. The exterior walls of the Chancery are clad with flat (French) limestone panels set in a stacked pattern.  The original aluminum (double insulated glass) windows are set in punched openings.


Project Solicitation

THE PROJECT SOLICITATION WILL CONSIST OF TWO PHASES. This announcement for pre-qualification is Phase I. The Department of State will evaluate and rate the pre-qualification proposals based on the evaluation criteria set forth in the following Pass/Fail Evaluation Factors. Those offerors receiving a satisfactory evaluated rating from the technical board will be issued a formal solicitation (Request for Proposal) and invited to submit proposed pricing in Phase II. The government reserves the right not to pre-qualify any offeror receiving less than a satisfactory rating in any evaluation factor or sub-factor. 

Prior Prequalification

	Prequalifications were done for the NEC projects in Johannesburg, Sarajevo, Harare,  Brazzaville, Libreville, Surabaya, Djibouti, Ouagadougou and Antananarivo and Beirut. Firms found prequalified for the specific individual projects listed in the previous sentence may prequalify for this project by submitting a letter of interest as described below prior to the closure date of this solicitation. Design build firms that submitted a prequalification package for SED design-build projects of similar scope and dollar value during FY 2005 and were successfully pre-qualified by the OBO technical panel need not resubmit a complete pre-qualification package under this announcement. If interested, the previously pre-qualified offerors must send the POC a letter of interest as described below prior to the closure date of this solicitation. 
	
         Letter of Interest:  The letter must be submitted in accordance with  the previous paragraph. However, if any changes have occurred in the construction firm's structure, size status, or team of the construction aspect of the offeror's original design-build pre-qualification package, the offeror must identify the change(s) in the letter for the government to review and evaluate. The government will determine if such changes are acceptable.  Offerors must ensure that they cite the RFP number of the previous pre-qualification solicitation and what specific changes were made since pre-qualification. A change by the contractor must be sent for evaluation to this office regardless of how minor the offeror may believe it is. If no changes have occurred since pre-qualification, the offeror must state this in the letter of interest. Offerors are reminded that the letter of interest is due prior to the closure time and date of this solicitation otherwise the offeror will not be evaluated for pre-qualification for this project.

	Prequalification based on successful prior prequalification for the specific projects list above or based on prequalification in FY 2005 is subject to a satisfactory evaluation of Past and Present Performance as described in Factor 3 below.  Offerors need not provide additional Past Performance information.  The Government will determine the extent to which past performance will be evaluated and the internal and/or external sources from which past performance information will be sought, if any.

Prequalification Requirements

The submissions received in response to the Phase II formal solicitation shall be submitted in the formats provided and will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation procedures contained in the solicitation. Due to time constraints, it is anticipated that the pre-qualified firms will be required to participate in visits to the project sites within 10 to 15 days after the issuance of the design-bid-build RFP. To offset some of the cost of the site visits and other related costs, pre-qualified firms that do not receive the design-bid-build award will be paid $10,000.00 for a fair and reasonable and responsive project proposal they submit in Phase II.

Phase I

MANDATORY PREQUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS: Firms being considered for award under this acquisition are limited to United States person bidders. Each company responding to this notice shall contact the DOS Contract Specialist for a copy of the pamphlet "Certifications Relevant To Public Law 99-399, Statement of Qualifications for Purpose of Section 402 of The Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986."  (The pamphlet is contained in the FEDBIZOPPS announcement.)  The pamphlet must be completed and included as part of the pre-qualifications package. If a joint venture is formed, the company having 51 percent or greater interest in the JV must be the one completing the pamphlet. This is a pass/fail evaluated area. Offerors must receive a pass rating in this area before proceeding to the next step in the evaluation process. Information on the US persons requirements may be viewed at:
http://www.statebuy.state.gov/grants/authorities.htm#procurement


SECURITY CLEARANCE REQUIREMENT

All entities comprising a joint venture for this effort must be issued an FCL, as well as the joint venture. If a pre-qualified firm does not possess the necessary DoD FCL, the Department of State will sponsor the firm for an FCL at the time they are determined to be pre-qualified. The Department of State will allow 90 calendar days from the notice of pre-qualification for firms to obtain the necessary FCL. Firms will not receive the classified portions of Phase II of the RFP until they have been issued the appropriate FCL and received Defense Security Service (DSS) approval to safeguard classified documents. Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the FCL. The Government will not be obligated to extend its solicitation schedule, or to make an award to a sponsored, pre-qualified firm, if that firm has not been issued a FCL.

Security clearances must be in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DoD 5220.22-M. Specifically designated personnel requiring access to classified information or to the Controlled Access Areas (CAA) must also possess a Secret or Interim Secret personnel security clearance issued by DSS.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Minerals Management Service (MMS), U. S. Department of the Interior.  It is the Government's intent, based on the information received as a result of this notice, to make an award as a 100% small business set-aside.  The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential small business sources that are interested in and capable of performing the work described below.  All interested parties must be able to qualify under the North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 541710:  Oceanographic Research and Development Laboratories or Services.  The Small Business Association's size standard for this NAICS Code is 500 employees.  MMS does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted in response to this RFI.  Based on the review of the responses to this Request for Information, the MMS reserves the right to issue a small business set aside, or full and open, competitive requirement for Capability Statements and subsequently a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with FAR 15.202.  However, please be advised that this announcement may constitute the only notice for this acquisition, based on the review of the responses to this Request for Information.  MMS will not accept unsolicited proposals related to the subject of this RFI.  Pursuant to FAR 52.219-14, at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the small business concern.    In order to compete under this acquisition, interested parties must demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing a Capabilities Statement as specified herein.  Furthermore, the Capabilities Statement must certify qualification under the NAICS code specified herein.  Offerors who do not qualify as a small business shall not be considered further and will be rejected.  Further instructions regarding submission of Capabilities Statements are contained herein.  Following a review and evaluation of all Capabilities Statements received from this announcement, a list of those deemed qualified to perform the work and which qualify under the NACIS Code 541710 will be established and will be notified regarding release of information on submission of a proposal.  The Government anticipates firm fixed price task orders issued against an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract for this effort.   PURPOSE OF PROPOSED STUDY:   The purpose of the proposed study is to obtain information and field data on the environmental fate and effects of a synthetic-based drilling fluid (SBF) accidental release. This study has the following objectives: (1) to determine the spatial distribution of SBF on the seafloor after an accidental release, (2) to evaluate the initial environmental impact, (3) to compare the data generated from the spill location to relevant SBF cuttings discharge studies, and (4) if possible, to evaluate the temporal changes of the accidental release.  The study hinges upon the occurrence of an appropriate spill of opportunity, of sufficient volume and at a location close to the seafloor so that SBF accumulates.  Sampling should occur within eight months of the accidental release. The location of the spill, based on historical information, is expected to be in deeper waters (greater than 1500 feet).  Five primary tasks are associated with this effort. They are to (1) prepare a preliminary cruise plan, (2) conduct field sampling at the designated site, (3) analyze the samples, (4) interpret, synthesize, and report data, and (5) evaluate the temporal changes at the site.  The aerial extent and distribution of the SBF should be determined through visual and mechanical sampling.  Measurements that may be considered are ROV submersible surveys, sediment coring, sediment screening measurements, swath bathymetry/multi beam or similar high resolution sonar mapping.  The field sample collection and sample analysis task should include representative physical and chemical sampling of the sediments and water in the area impacted by the spill. The physical and chemical parameters of interest for sediments include, but are not limited to grain size, organic carbon content, dissolved oxygen content, oxidation/reduction potential, total petroleum hydrocarbon content (TPH), and indicators of drilling and production wastes. Field sampling and analysis should include the parent SBF and breakdown product content.  The synthesis report should include historical information about accidental releases, an expert discussion of synthetic based fluid fate and effects in the marine environment, comparison of results to permitted discharges, a summary of the observations made during the site visit and the analytical results, and an expert discussion of the environmental effects at the selected site.  SOURCES SOUGHT:  Interested organizations should submit a capability statement of approximately 20 pages that details the small business firm's ability to perform the effort described above.  Emphasis should be placed on the organization's familiarity and understanding of the deep water Gulf of Mexico environment and effects of oil and gas exploration, their experience in the type of work proposed, demonstrated ability to do the work, publication record in peer reviewed scientific journals, and an understanding of the directed missions of the MMS, as well as the company's prior experience in work of similar scope to this project and complexity, qualifications of the organization's key personnel (those who would have primary responsibility for performing and or managing the tasks with their qualifications, and timely delivery of final products.  All proprietary information should be marked as such.  Responses will be reviewed by MMS personnel and will be held in a confidential manner. Capability Statements will be evaluated on the basis of:  (1) the understanding of effort and objectives; (2) experience and expertise of key technical personnel, (3) degree of comparability of past projects to the current project.  RESPONSES ARE DUE no later than 2:00 p.m. E.T. on March 17, 2006.  Please submit four (4) copies of your response to the attention of Debra Bridge, Contract Specialist, Procurement Operations Branch, Minerals Management Service, and if using regular U.S. mail - MS 2101, 381 Elden Street, Herndon, VA  20170.   Questions regarding this Request for Information should be submitted via email to debra.bridge@mms.gov.  Please include with your questions your full name, the RFI No. 39572, and title "Deepwater Program:  Synthetic-Based Fluid Spill of Opportunity," your organization's name, complete address, and phone and fax numbers.  PHONE CALLS ARE STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.

<DESC>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is conducting market research for patent application analysis tools for automating a wide range of common patent analysis tasks enabling users to analyze patent applications and extract meaningful information/intelligence. This market research shall be conducted at NO COST TO THE GOVERNMENT. This announcement is a Request For Information (RFI), not a solicitation announcement for proposals, and accordingly, no contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. Strong relationships with industry are a priority of the USPTO, and the USPTO wishes to express its appreciation in advance to all organizations that choose to provide information in accordance with this information request. 
Background
The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is an agency in the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) with its headquarters presently located in Alexandria, Virginia. The mission of the USPTO is the examination and issuance of patents and the examination and registration of trademarks. The USPTO serves the interest of inventors and businesses with respect to their inventions and corporate products, and service identifications. It also advises and assists the bureaus and offices of the Department of Commerce and other agencies of the Government in matters involving intellectual property. 

Currently the USPTO databases house about 7 million patents and over 30 million documents comprising 19 terabytes of storage with 6,000 internal users and 1,500 concurrent public users. There is an ongoing need to examine patent applications, maintain patent quality, and perform patentability analysis.

ALL ANALYSIS TOOL VENDORS ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND TO THIS RFI.  USPTO is considering multiple analysis tools to aid examiners.  It is highly desirable that analysis software products be web-based and platform independent.  The following interest list is not inclusive of all analysis capabilities being sought for consideration.

1.  Improve retrieval of relevant documents by employing latent semantic analysis techniques and/or conceptual search technology (i.e. concept-based search capability), taxonomy or equivalent.

2.  Provide data mining software for analyzing trends in data.  Data mining of numeric data, categorical data, mixed data, sequence and documents.

3.  Provide text mining that enables optimization of information processing by transforming text into data that can be analyzed for information extraction or automatic classification of documents. 
-	Improve text mapping, which involves clustering or categorizing
documents based on the major concepts that are contained within.
		-     Create lists of clusters categorizing the documents.


4.  Use advanced semantic, statistical and structural tagging technologies to tag critical information buried within documents.  Also, tag any textual content for re-use.

5.   Provide for Claims Analysis and performing claim searching as follows:

a.  Application Claim Tree Processing capability with Hierarchal GUI 
     presentation of a Claims tree:
-   Assist an examiner in quickly identifying restrictions; 
-   Show or Hide dependent claims on all outline levels in the entire          
    claim tree;
-   Provide claim tree versioning to document the original claim tree
    and claim trees for subsequent actions and amendments; and
-   Provide ability to annotate claim trees.

b.  Automatically highlight claims, which may be subject to rejections 
     based on:
       -  35 U.S.C. 112 2nd paragraph (vague and indefinite, or improper 
           claim language, improper Markush Language, improper Jepson 
           claims)
       -  35 U.S.C. 112 1st paragraph (new matter-if linked to searching the 
           instant specification)
-   non-statutory subject matter (e.g. 35 U.S.C. 101 issues) 

c.  Automate Double Patenting/Interference searches - link to USPTO
     search databases and provide a result set of all applications that have 
     similar claim language.
        -  Automatically generate an Inventor/Assignee search with result set. 
        -  Identify the key words used in the claim set and provide examiners
           with  draft Interference searches.

d.  Provide automated claim checks to identify discrepancies that are used 
     to denote grammar, punctuation or awkward language (translation from 
     a foreign document).

e.  Parse claim set to check for multiple dependencies such as claim 4 
     depending from 1 or 2 or 3. 


6.  Perform real-time, iterative searches of patent data including patent citation search and display.  Iteratively search through generations of patent references and view forward and backward patent references at the same time. 


7.  Ability to develop a custom search loaded with trade journals, all the patent references, all the foreign art, and having references viewed and scrolled through as quickly as 0.5 seconds per page.

8. Interface with existing USPTO automated information systems and search tools which includes but not limited to EAST, WEST, NPL, MPEP Insight, Classification Insight, OACS, eDAN, PLUS, etc.

9.  Search Strategies Profiles to provide the ability to define search strategy once and then execute the search in multiple systems without having to spend time reformatting (transforming) the search criteria (input) for each and every system.  The template can further insure consistent prior art searches by standardizing search strategies.

<DESC>The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) is seeking access to operational weather data required by the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS), including but not limited to, radar mosaics of base reflectivity for the United States (U.S.), Canada, and San Juan and an echo tops mosaic for the U.S., lightning, alphanumeric text, high resolution gridded model data and the distribution license of the data except lightning data.  This data set is important for the mission of ETMS.  ETMS is an operational FAA system providing the means by which the FAA can monitor and control air traffic.  A major component of ETMS is its weather overlay and backgrounds processing functions that require access to operational weather data.  To that e nd, the ETMS Aviation Weather Network (AWN) has been developed and evolved over the years to receive, ingest and process the required weather data set from Weather Service International Corporation (WSI).  The Volpe Center is seeking capability information in the form mentioned under Capability Requirements below.  This is not a request for competitive proposals or qualifications.  The information must show that any interested party has the ability to provide the requisite services, data and operational support that meet the following Government requirements: The Contractor shall provide the weather data in a digital stream for direct input into the ETMS AWN.  The Contractor shall transmit the data to ETMS Hub site and its designated Disaster Recovery Hub site via non-Internet, reliabl e, robust, independent and dual-redundant communication links, at least one of which must be a land-based circuit with sufficient bandwidth to carry all weather data required by ETMS. All the data must be compatible with the existing ETMS application programs such as the AWN, Traffic Situation Display (TSD), and the ETMS flight modeling program. The U.S. radar data mosaics shall be of a minimum of 2km spatial resolution from all available National Weather Service radar sites.  The data shall contain 16 levels of radar reflectivity intensity.  The data must be quality controlled prior to delivery to ETMS.  A version shall be available every 5 minutes with automated quality control algorithms.  A product of 15-minute temporal resolution is required with manual quality control check. The Canadian radar mosaic shall be of 2km spatial resolution and 15-minute temporal resolution on the national scale.  The Contractor must receive this data from Environment Canada via a direct, dedicated communications circuit.  Internet access to the Canadian data is not acceptable. Echo tops shall contain the highest detected echoes above a given location.  The data shall be of 4km spatial resolution and is updated every 10 minutes.  The data is on the national scale. ETMS TSD software requires that radar mosaics are run-length encoded. Lightning data shall contain time, location, polarity and amplitude of flashes and shall be from a continuous data feed.  The data shall be accurate to within 10km or less over the contiguous 48 states.  The data shall be on the national scale. The data must be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week and shall be available for redistribution to other ETMS remote sites currently receiving the data from the Volpe ETMS Hub site and other additional sites designated by the Volpe Hub site in the future. The Government will acquire the requisite service, data, and the necessary distribution licenses, for a period of one base year period and four one-year options.   Capability Requirements All responsible sources may respond to this SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE and responses will be fully considered by the Agency.  Interested firms are required to demonstrate that its weather data is compatible with ETMS by supplying a sample data set in a CD ROM at no cost to the Government, of the radar mosaics of base reflectivity for the U .S., Canada and San Juan, an echo tops mosaic for the U.S., 40 km Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) 236, MESO-Eta and global 1-degree AVN and two (2) copies of descriptive documentation in sufficient detail, do not include any pricing information, to allow an evaluation of a bonafide capability to satisfy the Government’s requirements within fifteen (15) calendar days of publication of this notice.

<DESC>The EPA has integrated its air toxics program into four components.  The first component is source specific regulatory programs.  The first component includes the development of MACT standards under section 112(d), MACT or generally available control technology (GACT) standards under 112(k), residual risk standards under 112(f), and other standards to regulate emissions of air toxics from specific sources.  The second component includes national, regional, and community-based initiatives on multi-media and cumulative risks, such as the Great Water Program and EPA?s persistent, Bioaccumulative, and toxic chemicals (PBT) initiative.  The third component, National Air Toxics Assessments (NATA), will provide quantitative estimates of the health risks associated with air toxics on a variety of geographic scales ranging from national-scale assessments to local-scale analyses.  The fourth and final component of EPA?s air toxics program is education and outreach.  As a result of this integration, the Environmental Protection Agency has a requirement to obtain contractor support for the Chemicals, Coatings, and Commerce Sectors.  The resulting contract will provide support for the first component, source specific regulatory programs.  The source specific regulatory component of the EPA's air toxics program includes the development of technology-based standards for both major and area sources, residual risk standards, as well as, other standards development activities.  In addition to supporting the development of standards which regulate the emission of air toxics from stationary sources, this requirement will provide support for developing stationary  source criteria pollutant standards.  These standards may take the form of either a New Source Performance Standard (NSPS), as defined in Section 111 of the CAA, or a standard based on "best available controls" (BAC), as defined in section 183(e) of the CAA or guidance documents, such as Control Techniques Guideline (CTG) documents, in lieu of a standard.  The tasks involved for this requirement will facilitate the process of developing or reviewing any of the types of standards or guidance documents discussed above or any other Federal rule mandated by the CAA or other Federal authority as it relates to support for pollutants in the chemicals, coatings, and commerce sectors. EPA anticipates the award of two cost-plus fixed fee level of effort type contracts (One contract is anticipated to be awarded on the basis of full and open  competition and one contract is anticipated to be awarded as a 100% small business set-aside).  The total duration of each proposed contract is fifty-seven (57) months consisting of a nine (9) month base period and four (4) additional twelve-month option periods.  The base quantity labor hours for each one of the proposed contracts will consist of 7,500 hours for the 9 month base period and 10,000 base quantity labor hours for each one of the option periods.  Each contract will also include additional optional quantity labor hours in the amount of 22,500 optional quantity labor hours for the base period and 30,000 optional quantity labor hours each one of the option periods for a total of 190,000 labor hours for each contract.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541620  with a size standard of 6.5 million.  This is an invitation to participate in a pre-solicitation conference.    The purpose of the conference is to provide background information concerning the Statement of Work (SOW) to potential offerors and to create an open forum for discussions concerning the objectives of the project.  Any and all questions submitted should be directly related to the DRAFT SOW and technical evaluation criteria.  There will be no discussion of budget at the conference or any other subject matter that does not directly pertain to the DRAFT SOW or technical evaluation criteria.  Both the draft statement of work and evaluation factors are available at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd/.  The conference will be held on March 9, 2006 from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM at the EPA-RTP main campus.

<DESC>The Office of Personnel Management has an interest and is requesting information from sources capable of providing fitness center access in accordance with the Statement of Work provided below.  This is a Request for Information only.  

Fitness Center Access Statement of Work
OPM Healthier Worksite Initiative – March 2005

I.	Background and Need

OPM’s work/life program is designed to assist OPM employees in balancing the demands of work and family responsibilities which ultimately results in a healthier and more productive workplace.  On-going OPM initiatives include: Childcare Subsidy program, on-site health unit, Health Fair, Alternate Work Schedule, Telecommuting, on-site Employee Assistance Program, Legal and Financial Services, and periodic and health and wellness programs.  

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in health/wellness at the worksite, especially among younger employees who are motivated to develop healthy lifestyles.  Employees throughout OPM have begun to ask about the availability of health/wellness opportunities, including access to on-site fitness centers.  

One solution to increasing fitness center access for all employees is to provide an ongoing opportunity to join a nearby fitness center through a service that maintains a nationwide fitness center network by negotiating with chain and individual fitness clubs to provide reduced rates and membership flexibility to individual employees.    This strategy for fitness center access is consistent with OPM’s guidance for providing physical fitness programs.   Employees working at OPM sites that lack a nearby joint-use worksite fitness center, such as many non-DC locations, are especially likely to benefit from such a service.  In addition, employees who travel frequently or are detailed to other locations are also likely to use this service, if it offers an option to “freeze” a membership at the person’s primary club and issues free guest passes to network clubs throughout the U.S.  

II.	Project Objectives
The purpose of this project is to increase fitness center access to OPM employees nationwide, thereby reducing a cost barrier to regular physical activity for employees and their families.  Our objective is to provide this access, at no cost to OPM, through an experienced company that has a well-established nationwide fitness center network, to which it offers membership discounts and flexibility to employees of companies/agencies that contract for these services.


III.	Scope of Work
A.	Contractor Responsibilities - The contractor will be responsible for negotiating with and maintaining a nationwide network of at least 1500 chain and individual fitness clubs to provide reduced rates for OPM employees and their families, pursuing additions to their network as needed in locations where there are OPM employees, enrolling OPM employees who submit membership applications, providing an on-line registration and employee information/communication system, providing OPM with all promotional materials, handling all membership, billing and network administrative duties, assisting with program promotion and providing OPM with aggregate membership data.  There will be no charge to OPM for these services.  The contractor is expected to provide written references and contacts from employers who use their services.
B.	OPM Responsibilities - OPM will be responsible for distributing materials provided by the contractor, such as posters, website information and hard-copy directories, to OPM employees after the contractor has shipped them to locations designated by OPM.  OPM will also provide a programmatic contact person for the contractor to communicate with about program implementation, as well as a contract specialist for contract-related issues.

IV.	Technical Requirements
A.  Deliverables:
1.	There is no charge to OPM for the contractor’s services outlined in the following items A. through E.
2.	Provide access for OPM employees, retirees and their families to an established network of at least 1500 individual and chain fitness centers throughout the United States at a larger membership fee discount than what employees could obtain without this service being offered through OPM.
3.	If the contractor’s current network does not include fitness centers in some areas where OPM employees work or reside, the contractor must be willing to negotiate with local fitness clubs to bring them into the network.
4.	Provide flexible memberships that allow employees to use network clubs at no extra charge while on travel and permit freezing or transfer of memberships for employees on longer term assignments away from their local fitness club. 
5.	No minimum employee participation is required by the contractor nationwide or by geographic region.
6.	Establish and maintain a separate URL and customized website for OPM employees to include membership registration, a fitness club locator and program information, and excluding products other than fitness center discounts, such as supplements and diets/counseling, unless OPM provides prior written approval for specific additional items. 
7.	Perform all administrative duties related to employee registration and membership, including accepting payments/billing, record-keeping and customer services.
8.	Provide OPM with aggregate utilization data by geographic area for program evaluation purposes.  (See “V. – Reporting Schedule”). Protect employee confidentiality by not identifying individuals in these data sets.
9.	Provide ongoing promotional programs, materials and incentives to encourage physical activity among OPM employee members.  This includes but is not limited to:
a)	Maintaining a directory of network fitness clubs that lists names and addresses of current network fitness clubs, sorted by zip code and available on-line and in hard copy.
b)	Providing promotional posters, flyers and hard-copy directories and shipping them to OPM locations nationwide as designated by OPM.  The contractor will ship promotional materials to arrive at these locations at least 30 business days prior to onset of the promotion.

B. Standards/Qualifications:
1.	The contractor will have at least 5 years experience and demonstrated success at managing a fitness center discount network.
2.	The contractor must have an already established network of at least 1500 individual and chain fitness centers throughout the United States.
3.	The contractor will supply written references from and contact information for at least four employers or other companies that use the fitness network.
4.	Fitness centers must abide by International Health, Racquet and Sportclub Association (IHRSA) membership standards to be included in the contractor’s network.


C. Personnel
1.	Assign a staff member who is responsible for services provided to OPM employees and who communicates regularly with the OPM contact person.
2.	Provide a staffed system for handling OPM employees’ suggestions and promptly responding to any issues related to their memberships.

D. Schedule 
1.	Data Reporting - refer to section V. below.
2.	Shipping of Promotional Materials - refer to section IV–9b.
3.	Services described in IV-A through E will be provided for the duration of this contract.

E. Location
1.	Administrative services are provided from the contractor’s offices, on-line, by mail, email and telephone. 

V.	Reporting Schedule
The contractor will track and provide data on the number of employees registering for the service, by geographic site.  These data will be provided to OPM on a monthly basis for the first 6 months of the project, and then may be reduced to quarterly if OPM chooses.  To protect employee confidentiality, data provided to OPM will be aggregated by geographic location and will not identify individual employees or their family members.  The contractor must be willing to work with OPM to design and implement ways to measure actual fitness center utilization.

VI.	Special Considerations – none

<DESC>The U. S. Department of the Treasury (Department), Office of Chief Information Officer is issuing a Request for Information (RFI) to identify industry suggestions and best practices regarding Computer Security Incident Response Capability (CSIRC).  The Department is seeking sources for a possible future acquisition to conduct a study of the Treasury Computer Security Incident Response Capability (TCSIRC).  This RFI solicits industry’s interest and capability to meet stated objectives and is for information and planning purposes only.  This does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a promise to issue one in the future.  Furthermore, the Department is not liable for any costs incurred as a result of vendor responses to this RFI.  The Government does not intend to award a contract for any supply or service on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information.  This request is issued for the purpose to 1) receive information and feedback on interest and capabilities of potential sources; 2) inform the Government on the type and scope of work involved in conducting a study of the CSIRC within the Department of Treasury. 

BACKGROUND:

The U.S. Department of the Treasury (Department) operates a Treasury Computer Security Incident Response Capability (TCSIRC), which provides a single organizational point of contact for 1) vulnerability and incident information dissemination and 2) facilitates incident reporting with external reporting entities including US-CERT.  The TRSIRC interacts with the CSIRC’s at the various Treasury bureaus and, in that sense, does not routinely interact with end users, but operates primarily through the CSIRCs.  The TCSIRC’s role and responsibility is primarily associated with unclassified systems; however, TCSIRC may be associated with classified systems in the near future.

SCOPE: 

The Department is seeking information from private entities that currently possess expert and detailed knowledge of the operation of CSIRCs in a substantial and representative sample of government agencies and private sector.  The Department is interested in making a determination as to whether the TCSIRC services currently being provided adequately address the needs of the Department, its constituents and the requirements levied upon the Department by external authorities.  The purpose of this RFI is not to obtain information regarding the performance of the TCSIRC current service provider to the Department but to request information regarding the services that a CSIRC should provide.  To that end, the Department is interested in various CSIRC capabilities within the Federal arena as well as the private sector.  Responders are requested to address the following questions:

1)	Describe your knowledge and expertise regarding CSIRCs in the Federal and private sector.
2)	What is the nature and type of security incidents CSIRCs must address?
3)	What are the services that should be provided by a CSIRC capability?
4)	What are potential problems that arise in managing a CSIRC program?
5)	What are the key cost elements that will drive a vendor’s cost proposal in response to a solicitation for conductng a study of a CSIRC program? 
6)	What are suggested evaluation criteria or factors that the Government should consider in the development of a Request for Proposal to conduct a study of TCSIRC should it choose to issue one?

RESPONSE:

Your response should be no more than seven (7) pages total, 
one-sided pages with print no smaller than 12 point.  Responses must be submitted in Microsoft Word 2000 or later.  Interested parties may submit their responses this RFI to Tammy McLeod, Contracting Officer via e-mail at tammy.mcleod@do.treas.gov.  Responses to the RFI should address how the responder would meet the Government’s requirements, in the form of questions for clarification and suggestions for additional requirements that the Government should consider.  Responses should refer to 
RFI-06-0001.  Responses must be received via e-mail by 
5:00 p.m. EST on Monday, March 6, 2006.

<DESC>The U.S. Forest Service is considering whether or not to set aside an acquisition for HUBZone, Small Business concerns or Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business concerns.  The estimated maximum value of this procurement is between $1,000,000.00 and $2,000,000.00. The NAICS is 237990 with a small business size standard of less than $31.5M  The acquisition is for an Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity Performance Based-Services contract to provide trail maintenance services throughout the Wayne National Forest.  The performance period is for a base period of one-year and 4 one-year option periods.  The scope of the acquisition is to provide maintenance of approximately 110 miles of Off Road Vehicle (ORV) trails, 70 miles of Horse trails and 200 miles of other trails that are a combination of aggregate and native surface.  Most trails are located in forested areas with moderate to heavy vegetation beside and overhead.  Due to the restricted width of the maintained trails, most locations do not allow access for over-road vehicles.  The acquisition is expected to be issued under full and open competition procedures.  However, in accordance with (1)  FAR 19.1305, if your firm is HUBZone certified,  or (2) FAR 19.14:  if your firm is a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, or (3) FAR 19.502-2 (b) (1), if your firm is a Small Business, and intends to submit an offer on this acquisition, please respond by email to mcorse@fs.fed.us or by fax at (812)279-3423.  In your response please include: (a) a positive statement of your intention to submit an offer for this solicitation as a prime contractor; (b) evidence of experience in work similar in type and scope.  Please include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, points of contact and telephone numbers.  At least two and no more than four references are requested.  Your response is required by February 27, 2006. All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on a HUBZone, Small Business or Service-Disabled Veteran-owned set aside.  Contractors are reminded that should this acquisition become a HUBZone set aside, FAR 52.219-3 Notice of Total HUBZone Set-Aside will apply.  Should this acquisition become a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business FAR 52.219-27 – Notice of Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set Aside will apply.  FAR 52.219-3 and FAR 52-219-27 each requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern.  Failure to submit all information requested may result in an unrestricted acquisition.  A decision on whether this will be pursued as a HUBZone set aside, a Small Business set aside, a Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business Set-Aside, or an unrestricted procurement will be posted on FEDBIZOPS.  The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, either before or after the closing date.  For information concerning this acquisition contact the Contracting Official listed above.  Questions may be referred to Mark Corse (812) 276-4729 or email to mcorse@fs.fed.us

<DESC>Washington Savannah River Company (WSRC), managing contractor of the Savannah River Site for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is soliciting expressions of interest from companies wishing to participate in a joint research project under a cost-shared subcontract with the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) to develop critical technology for the Hybrid Sulfur (HyS) thermochemical cycle for the production of hydrogen.  The HyS Process is one of the baseline candidates identified by the U.S. Department of Energy for splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using thermal energy for advanced nuclear reactors or solar central receivers.  It is a two-step hybrid cycle (one thermochemical reaction and one electrochemical reaction) that involves only sulfur, oxygen and hydrogen compounds.  Experimental work has begun on the sulfur dioxide depolarized electrolyzer, the major developmental component in the cycle.  Proof-of-concept tests have established proton-exchange-membrane (PEM) cells as a viable approach for conducting this reaction.  Further development of the HyS Process will require clear definition of the cost-effective electrolyzer performance targets, such as cell size, current density, cell resistance and long-term durability.  Fundamental material science is needed to develop PEM materials and microstructures that can achieve these performance targets.  A major technical requirement for the electrolyzer is the elimination or minimization of elemental sulfur formation caused by the crossover of sulfur dioxide from the anode to the cathode of the cell.  SRNL is seeking industry or academic partners to participate in cooperative research and development that would result in membranes or membrane-electrode-assemblies meeting these requirements.  SRNL would characterize and test the membranes in their existing electrolyzer test facilities.  It is expected that one or more companies will be selected to participate by performing work under a cost-shared subcontract with SRNL.  Initial period of performance is expected to be one year, with extensions for continued work dependent of the degree of success of the research.  Any company interested in participating in this research project must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by email) no later than March 27, 2006, summarizing the company’s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.  Responses should be limited to not more than three pages, including all attachments.  Based on the responses, SRNL may issue one or more solicitations for competitive procurement.  Questions and expressions of interest may be addressed to Jack Simon, Savannah River National Laboratory, Building 999 W Room 348, Aiken, SC, 29808; via telephone at (803) 819-8420; via fax at 803-819-8416; or via email at jack.simon@srnl.doe.gov.  This is not a solicitation for a procurement; it is a request for parties interested in collaborative research opportunities only.

<SUBJECT>A -- ONR Industry Workshop - Interface Ramp Technologies (IRT) for Sea Basing
<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR), Arlington, VA, will conduct a workshop on the mornings of the 14th and 15th of March 2006 to discuss Interface Ramp Technologies (IRT) concepts in preparation for a future solicitation under the Seabasing Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) program.  The goal is to pursue technologies which would enable vehicle transfer, via an advanced ramp system, to a landing platform through the high end of Sea state 4.  The advanced ramp system will consist of a lightweight ramp section (a reduction of 30-50% from today’s ramp systems) with integrated advanced connections and active motion compensation.

The objective of this workshop will be to discuss desired performance metrics and operational goals, the envisioned science and technology focus and to solicit industry input regarding an effective acquisition approach, risk reduction/mitigation, technology insertion, and other related issues.  The goal of the IRT program would be to contract for the design, production and demonstration testing of a full-scale prototype. 

The workshop will start at 8 A.M. Eastern Time on 14 March at Strategic Analysis, Inc located at 3601 Wilson Blvd, One Virginia Square, 6th floor, Arlington, VA 22201.  

The tentative agenda for the meeting includes:

Day 1:  
•An introduction and overview of the program including
expectations and metrics as well as past and ongoing efforts.
•Previous at-sea vehicle transfer test results.  
•An operator’s viewpoint and expected challenges.
•Acquisition program needs and the expected utility of this system.
•Day one will conclude with a Q&A session at the end of the
morning and will adjourn for the day.

Day 2:  
•A wrap up and additional Q&A session.
•The opportunity for each potential offeror to provide a one-on-one ½ hour brief to the government on their capabilities and possible concepts will be provided.

The workshop will conclude after the end of the one-on-one briefs and is expected to complete around noon on the 15th   of  March 2006.   All briefings and any discussions will be unclassified.  

To facilitate meeting planning, each company/entity attending the workshop is required to submit a completed registration form on all planned attendees.

<SUBJECT>B -- Space Threat Assessment Testbed (STAT)
<DESC>1.  SCOPE.
This request for information is directed to potential prime contractors who have demonstrated experience in the design, development, and integration of new satellite test capabilities.  The Government will use the information gathered in response to this RFI to refine potential acquisition strategies for the STAT.  Further, this information will help the Government structure a program that will mitigate cost, schedule and performance risks.

2.   OBJECTIVES.  
The main objectives in this project are as follows:
1. Design the STAT Spiral 1 facility.
2. Develop integrated environmental source and infrastructure control systems. 
3. Procure all necessary hardware that is not provided GFE.
4. Integrate the environmental sources, chamber subsystems, controls and Satellite Operation Center Links into a functional test capability.

3.  REQUIREMENTS.
The Space Threat Assessment Testbed shall have real time capability for emulating the natural and man-made space environment at various orbital conditions.  It shall also incorporate three operationally realistic man-made threat sources, and the ability to connect the System Under Test (SUT) to a satellite operations center (SOC).  The following are operational and system specifications or limitations applicable to the design and development of this System:

3.1	Operational:  The Space Threat Assessment Testbed shall emulate a complex natural and man-made space environment, to include realistic flux levels and/or fluences of the atomic oxygen, low energy protons, electrons, UV, contamination, and spacecraft charging.  It will also include three operationally relevant threat sources, and the ability to connect the payload to the Satellite Operations Center.
  
3.1.1	The system shall emulate the appropriate conditions for orbits ranging from Low Earth Orbit to Geosynchronous and Sun-Synchronous orbits.
  
3.1.2	The System shall have the capability to operate the threat sources and the environmental source in a controlled manner to simulate realistic combined environmental conditions experienced by operational systems.

3.1.3	The system shall allow the connection of the System Under Test (SUT) to be connected to a remote Satellite Operations Center at the Center for Research Support (CERES) at Falcon AFB, Colorado, and shall monitor the data streams being fed over the control networks to ensure they meet all applicable standards and regulations.

3.1.4	The system shall allow real-time control of all sources to allow scripting of environmental and/or induced anomaly situations to be simulated.

3.2	Chamber Infrastructure:  An 8ft by 24ft vacuum chamber located at Arnold Engineering Development Center will be made available as GFE for this effort.  Integration of vacuum pumping and cryogenic systems, as well as an integrated control system shall be accomplished by the contractor.  Electrical Power (up to 440V 3-phase), water, compressed air and dry Nitrogen are all available through the existing building infrastructure.

3.3	Natural Environment Sources:

3.3.1	The system shall include atomic oxygen generation capabilities capable of simulating energy levels and fluxes representative of the levels experienced in Low Earth Orbits.  

3.3.2	The system shall include low energy proton acceleration capabilities capable of simulating fluences seen at solar max.

3.3.3	The system shall include UV lamps capable of simulating the solar spectra at 2 times solar intensity.

3.3.4	The system shall include electron acceleration capabilities capable of simulating trapped electrons.
 
3.4	Spacecraft Self-induced Condition Simulation:

3.4.1	The system shall include the capability to introduce controlled levels of contamination to simulate the outgassing and redeposition of other satellite materials on the System Under Test.

3.4.2	The system shall include ion acceleration sources capable of simulating electric propulsion back-flux of low-energy Xenon ions.

3.4.3	The system shall include the capability to introduce an electric potential on the surface of the System Under Test to simulate the effects of spacecraft self-charging.

3.5	Threat Sources:  The system shall include three operationally relevant threat sources capable of simulating the effects of those threats on the satellite.

3.6	Connectivity to Satellite Operations Center:  The System shall allow the payload to be connected to the Satellite Operations Center in the Center for Research Support (CERES) at Schriever AFB, CO.  This will allow integrated operational test and evaluation, crew training, anomaly resolution utilizing actual hardware, the development of tactics, techniques and procedures, and assessment of system level vulnerabilities to natural and induced environments.  Due to the possibility of early utilization of the CCOSE chamber (see below) in Tactics, Techniques and Procedures development, connectivity must be achieved within the first 3 months of the program.

3.7	Existing Prototype:  The existing CCOSE chamber, located at AEDC was developed under the Test Technology Development and Demonstration program, and represents a subscale prototype and risk reduction effort.  This facility, and the technologies incorporated into it will be made available to the contractor to use in the development of the STAT facility.

<SUBJECT>--MARKET RESEARCH - DOING BUSINESS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES - REGIONAL STUDIES
<DESC>GOVERNMENT POINT OF CONTACT:  Mr. Kenneth Haynes,  kenneth.haynes@us.army.mil, 910-432-9108 x119.  All questions and concerns should be addressed to Mr. Haynes. MARKET RESEARCH:  DOING BUSINESS IN (FOREIGN COUNTRIES). KEYWORDS:  Regional studies; country-specific; cultural; cross-cultural; training; training materials; dos and donts; taboos; rapport building; course development; doing business; business practices; manners; customs. RESEARCH:  The United States Army Security Assistance Training Management Organization at Fort Bragg, NC, seeks information on country-specific training for Army personnel going overseas on training and technical assistance missions with our allies. PROPOSED TASK:   The United States Army Security Assistance Training Management Organization (USASATMO, or SATMO) deploys military and Government training and technical assistance teams to US allied countries.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation, N00173-06-R-DB02, is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 2005-08 and DFARS Change Notice 20051220. The associated small business size standard is 334516 and 500 employees. CLIN 0001, the Naval Research Laboratory has a Requirement for a high repetition rate spectrometer.  This equipment is needed to provide spectroscopic measurements over a large spectral range and at a high repetition rate.  Because the effects to be investigated are inherently nonlinear, and because sources may fluctuate from shot to shot, the system must be able to simultaneously record signal and reference spectra and process the full spectrum at a 1 kHz repetition rate in the visible and at 50 Hz in the NIR. The system requires an imaging dual exit port spectrometer that can accommodate two cameras simultaneously. One camera will cover the ultraviolet and the visible spectral range (200 – 900 nm) with an intensified CCD camera. The second camera will cover the near-infrared spectral range (900-1700 nm) and also be an imaging camera (2D). Switching between cameras must be accomplished via either a motorized turning mirror or stationary dichroic mirror.  The system must have at least 3 automatically accessible gratings, with additional capability to manually switch among different grating triplets. The system operation must be automated and come with LABVIEW drivers. The visible camera (0.2 – 0.9 micrometer) must be able to record two spectra in parallel at 1 kHz repetition rate on a single CCD and allow for division of the two directly on-chip for real time data acquisition.  The camera must be configured to trigger in sync with a 1 kHz laser source.  Furthermore, to accommodate fluorescence decay measurements, it must have a minimum gate width of 5 nanoseconds or less which can be delayed with respect to the laser pulse by up to at least 5 milliseconds with a precision higher than 50 ps. The near-infrared camera (0.8 – 1.7 micrometer) must be able to record two spectra in parallel, and at least allow for post-process binning. The IR camera must record data at a minimum of 50 Hz. Due to the complexity of the technology, it is required that the vendor awarded the bid demonstrate proven capability to deliver a suitable system. Specifications for the imaging spectrometer: Input: Fiber coupling matched to the monochrometer f number using a 2-leg fiber bundle, one bundle for reference and one for signal.; Each bundle must consist of a minimum of 7 fibers to account for beam walk and distortions during measurements.; Fiber transmission range must span 0.2-1.7 micrometers; Two additional 2-leg fiber bundles required.  Spectral Ranges: Two triplet grating turrets with the following gratings: Grating One must be optimized for the mid-range of the visible camera: blazed near 500 nm and with a groove density designed to provide single-scan coverage from 450-750 nm over the width of the visible camera, with a resolution less than 0.8 nm; Grating Two must be optimized for the UV-range of the visible camera: blazed near 250 nm and with a groove density designed to provide single-scan coverage from 200-300 nm over the width of the visible camera, with a resolution less than 0.25 nm; Grating Three must be optimized for high resolution near and just red of 532 nm: blazed near 570 nm and with a groove density designed to provide less than 0.07 nm resolution and a spectral coverage of greater than 1000 wavenumbers over the visible camera.; Grating Four must be optimized for the cross-over point between the camera ranges: blazed at 900 nm and with a groove density designed for the greatest overall diffraction efficiency from 850-1000 nm.; Grating Five must be optimized for the NIR camera: blazed near 1200 nm and with a groove density designed to provide single-scan coverage from 1.06-1.65 micrometers over the width of the NIR camera, with a resolution of less than 2 nm.; Grating Six must be optimized for higher-resolution NIR scans: blazed near 1300 nm and with a groove density designed to provide single-scan coverage from 1.2-1.4 micrometers over the width of the NIR camera, with a resolution of less than 0.5 nm. Motorized automated filter wheel for discrimination against higher order grating effects with the following filters: At least one open position.; 400 nm long pass filter; 600 nm long pass filter; 800 nm long pass filter and; 1000 nm long pass filter. Specifications for 0.2 – 0.9 micrometer Camera: Minimum frames per second: 1000 with full vertical binning. Minimum required quantum efficiency at various wavelengths: 200nm: 15 percent, 400 nm: 15 percent, 600 nm: 35 percent, and 800 nm: 30 percent. Phosphor: Maximum of 5-microsecond decay. Digitization: Minimum of 16 bits. Trigger & Acquisition Requirements: Completely controllable by GUI-software interface, System delay of 30 nanoseconds or less, Delay Range: approximately 5 ns to 20 ms, Timing resolution: 40 ps, Gate width: 5 ns to 10 ms, and Pulse counting mode. Specifications for 0.8 – 1.7 micrometer Camera: Minimum Frames per second: 50, Format: Minimum 320 x 256, Quantum efficiency: Peak efficiency of at least 80 percent, and Digitization: Minimum of 16 bits. Deliverables: Spectrometer system, written operation and maintenance manuals, warranty of two years on all parts and labor, and installation and demonstration that the system meets the specified requirements.

PART 1.  GENERAL

1.1  GENERAL CONTRACT DESCRIPTION
  
General Overview:  This procurement will result in the award of a firm-fixed price design/build contract.  The project can be broken into three main components; historic mitigation, landscape repairs, and restoration of various nature trails.  

The historic mitigation is part of an effort by the Navy to develop a historical interpretative program to increase awareness and appreciation of the historic and archaeological resources within NAS Pensacola and, in particular, the significant developments in Naval warfare represented by the historic properties that are or were located within the Nation Historic Landmark District.  The program shall have a focus on interpreting the history of Naval Aviation and of NAS Pensacola for military personnel and the public, through the use of such means as interpretive displays and signage.  To that end, the project will provide a minimum of three new pedestrian plazas containing wayside exhibits and focal static exhibits, lighted walkways/sidewalks, and other site improvements and incidental related work in the vicinity of and along the existing seawall walkway on NAS Pensacola.  All new improvements shall complement and commemorate the National Historic Landmark District.  Two of the plazas shall be able to seat a minimum of 15 people, while a third larger plaza will be able to seat a minimum of 50 people.  The larger plaza shall also provide space to accommodate at least 200 persons for special events.  Development of the plazas, wayside exhibits and monuments shall require consultation with the Florida State Historic Preservation Officer, coordinated through the Navy.  The contractor shall provide bronze, granite, or other appropriate material for wayside exhibits and placards.  The inscribed or cast text and graphics on the wayside exhibits and placards will be approved by the Navy.  The project, where appropriate, will incorporate historic features such as the Building 47 smoke stack, terracotta rosettes, and other salvaged elements/artifacts from other historic buildings that have been demolished.  All work performed will be in accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA), as amended, and implementing regulations under 36 CFR Part 800; the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties (STANDARDS); and other applicable Federal, state and local laws, regulations and guidance documents

The project will re-establish the landscape and grounds on NAS Pensacola, NAS Whiting Field, NTTC Corry Station and Saufley Field to robust, context appropriate, pre-Hurricane Ivan state, including, but not limited to, the removal of trees that have been damaged to the point that they are no longer viable, the removal of stumps and snags, the removal of vegetative debris, and provision of needed restoration of the vegetative landscaping (including, but not be limited to, trees, shrubs, and groundcovers) that was adversely affected by recent hurricanes throughout the activities.  Areas to be restored will include, but not limited to, roads, more formal areas, and undeveloped areas.  New vegetation shall be maintained and guaranteed for a period of one year after the final acceptance of the project.

Additionally, at NAS Pensacola the project will repair the Trout Point Nature Trail (an ADA compliant boardwalk), repair and/or replace Osprey nesting platforms, repair the Bayou Grande Nature Trail, and repair the Lake Frederic Fishing Area.

It can be used to detect Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs) and CW agents in the form of vapor or aerosols such as:

Nerve agents for  example (GA, GB, GD, GF, GE, VX, VE, VG, VS)
Blister agents for example (HD, HL, L, PD,  ED, MD)
Blood Agents for example (SA,  AC)
