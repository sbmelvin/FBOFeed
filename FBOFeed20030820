<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Frontier Geosciences, Inc., 414 Pontius North, Seattle, WA  98109.  The proposed contract is to determine mercury for various combinations of species and sample matrices as follows:  Total Hg in water, 0.2 ng/L; methylhg in water, 0.02 ng/L; Total Hg in sediment 0.5 ng/g; methy1Hg in sediment, 0.015 ng/g.  Filtration must be by ultraclean methods, so that the same detection limits apply for filtered samples.  Owing to dilutions involved in the six step sequential selective extraction procedure method to determine Hg sprciation in sediments, method detection limits will be approximately 3 x the numbers given above.  Frontier Geoscience has participated in world-wide interlaboratory comparison tests, and met the requirements of world-wide QA/QC standards.  Their level of QA/QC is not excelled by any other laboratory.  Frontier Geoscience provides consultation on analytical, sampling, and contamination issues, and interpretation of results.  Since the sequential extraction procedure is new, this service is particulary important.  THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Information will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Determination to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government; no additional synopsis will be published.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement to repair a Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS). The FTS is a component of a larger system referred to as the National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System Airborne Sounder Testbed-Interferometer (NAST-I)instrument that is based on an ABB Bomem design and uses ABB Bomem components.  The repair work involves replacing Long Wave photoconductive Mercad Teluride (MCT)Infra-Red (IR) detector and integrated cooler.  The detector and cooler are components of the FTS.	 NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from ABB Bomem, Inc.  The authority for using other than full and open competition is FAR 6.302-1. Only repairs made by ABB Bomem to the FTS will ensure compatibility with existing components, which is critical to succesful operation of the NAST-I instrument and ultimately the NAST-I mission. ABB Bomem has previously made some modifications to the equipment and thus no other source is capable of satisfying the requirement without introducing significant risk associated with compatibility requirements. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 2, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for Satellite Up-Link Services for three distance learning series. There are a total of 27 broadcast or uplinks required, including troubleshooting services. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the services from the National Educational and Telecommunications Association (NETA) as the only known responsible source that can meet Agency requirements.  NETA is the only known professional association that serves public television licensees and stations in all 50 states, the US Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico.  They also operate the Public Broadcasting System (PBS) satellite used by the stations to down link the programming. It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to offer similar services that would meet this requirement, and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 5, 2003.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a non-competitive contract to the University of Iowa (UI) to validate a vision test (i.e., contrast sensitivity testing) for use as a surrogate for functional performance (i.e., driving) in 65 normal subjects.  This testing will be performed at the National Advanced Driving Simulator (NADS), which is owned by the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration and operated by UI.  The luminance, contrast, spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and field of view of this driving simulator do not limit the subject’s driving performance under nighttime driving conditions. The NADS will be used to correlate the visual aspects of driving performance with contrast sensitivity in a controlled environment, and has been extensively validated against real-world driving performance on a test track.  The staff at the UI/NADS has the necessary experience with driving studies and clinicians in the UI Department of Ophthalmology are prepared to carry out the ophthalmic evaluations.

<DESC>THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ADVERTISED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS INVITING FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION FOR TWO CONTRACTS, AND POTENTIAL SET-ASIDES FOR ONE 8A AND ONE HUBZONE ELIGIBLE CONCERN FOR THE REMAINING TWO CONTRACTS. This procurement will result in the award of up to four separate Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Design-Build Construction Contracts for general building type projects--new construction and renovations--including but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facilities, training, family housing, dormitory, community support facilities and industrial buildings, mechanical and electrical improvements, and civil construction--grading, drainage, and sewage, potable water-storage and transmission--, for the Department of Defense activities in the State of Louisiana managed by the Resident Officer in Charge of Construction, Southern Division, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, New Orleans, LA. The work will be concentrated at, but not limited to, the following locations:  Naval Support Activity, Naval Air Station, New Orleans, LA; Defense Information Systems Agency, Slidell, LA and other locations within their area of responsibility. Proposers will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build, Request for Proposal--RFP--procedures that result in awards based on Best Value to the Government, cost or price or other factors considered. Each contract is for one year with two option years. The estimated value of all contracts is $30 million. Projects will vary in size from around $100,000 to $3 million with the average project in the $500,000-$2 million range. Proposers will be required to submit a bid bond for the seed project, and for each task order.  This procurement will include potential set-asides for one 8a and one HUBZone eligible contractor. These proposers will be required to be rated as at least Acceptable in Phase I. If the 8a and-or the HUBZone proposers are not able to meet the requirements to make them Acceptable in Phase I, the solicitation will be reverted to unrestricted and awarded as such. The successful offerors will be encouraged to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract. Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders would be responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government. Task orders would require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement. Projects would also require incorporation of sustainable features. Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract. All professional disciplines shall be registered and-or certified in their discipline. In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state. Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase up to a maximum of seven proposers--design-build teams--based on design-build factors that include: Past Performance, Technical Qualifications--including proposed subcontractors--, Management Approach and Small Business Subcontracting Effort. Phase I design-build factors relate to the three year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects described above. Only those proposers selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II. In Phase II, the selected Phase I offerors must submit technical and price proposals. Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals would not be considered for an award. The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution; Small Business Subcontracting Effort; and other factors that define the quality of construction. Cost and Price proposal may include total cost or evaluation of scope-design options with the Government’s published budget for award. The offeror with the best value proposal, for each seed project, if there is more than one, will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts. An offeror may be awarded more than one of the seed projects if it is in the Government's best interest. The other IDIQ contract--s--will be awarded to the design-build offeror--s--who provide the best overall proposal--s--for all seed projects after those offerors who have been awarded a seed project--s--have been removed from further competition. A minimum guarantee of $25,000 will be consideration for the award of the other IDIQ contract--s--where a seed project is not awarded. The minimum guarantee will be payable only if the offeror--s--are awarded no task orders over the three year contract term. Future task orders would be competed among the firms that were awarded an IDIQ contract, with each task order awarded based on best value to the Government. The seed project--s--for this solicitation are unconfirmed at this time. Due to funding constraints, authorization to advertise the seed project--s--is not expected until after the Phase I portion of this solicitation is completed. It is possible that no seed project--s--will be authorized during this fiscal year and Phase II competition would be postponed until at least one suitable seed project is identified. FOR SPECIFICATIONS: The Government intends to issue Phase I on the WEB only. Phase I will be issued on or about 24 September 2003. Phase I proposals will be due around 24 October 2003.  PHASE II WILL BE ISSUED AT A LATER DATE. Both Phase I and Phase II, including plans and specifications, will be available for viewing and downloading at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.

<DESC>The Contractor shall provide all labor, supervision, tools, equipment, and incidental supplies necessary to perform Mechanical Site Preparation with Shredder/Grinder on the London Ranger District of the Daniel Boone National Forest in Laurel and Whitley Counties, Kentucky.  Work will take place in pine plantations (15-30 years old) where the trees have been killed by the Southern Pine Beetle during the past four years.  The pine trees in these stands are 20-70 feet tall.  The stands also contain large numbers of hardwood trees 10-50 feet tall.  The intent of the work is to create areas for the planting of pine seedlings by clearing the vegetation (pines, hardwoods, brush, etc.) from strips of land in the stands.  The cleared vegetation needs to be removed or shredded/chipped down to ground level or below to provide suitable planting sites.  A tracked excavator with a shredder/chipper head is the recommended type of equipment to be used in this work due to safety considerations when pushing down dead pine trees.  A tracked vehicle is also recommended to reduce soil compaction and disturbance.  Other types of equipment may be considered if they will meet the necessary performance and safety requirements.  The Technical Contact for this project is Bill Wais at 606-864-4163.  This project will be solicited using the Request for Quotation format with price and other factors considered.  The contract amount is estimated between $25,000 and $100,000.  This solicitation will be available both electronically and hard copy.  If you do not have the capability or capacity to download all of the documents, you can request a hard copy of the solicitation by sending a fax request to 859-745-4710.  Please specify the solicitation number and title on your request.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   NAICS Code 334516 The US Environmental Protection Agency, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures of FAR Part 13, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Innov-X Systems, Inc. for a Handheld Environmental Metals Analyzer with Light Element Analysis Package required by the National Enforcement Investigations Center (NEIC).  A handheld, portable XRF analyzer is needed for the NEIC laboratory to identify and quantify chemical compounds at sites where hazardous substances have been released.  The portable XRF analyzer is required to enable NEIC to  rapidly analyze toxic elements in samples in the lab or on site in a matter of minutes.  The Innov-X Model 440S is the only known product that meets the six minimum needs for an XRF Analyzer identified by NEIC, which if not met, would adversely impact its ability to fulfill its Homeland Security  mission.  These needs are:  (1) The instrument must use a silver anode X-ray tube so detection of arsenic, lead, chlorine, phosphorus, and mercury is optimized.  NEIC requires an instrument that can automatically perform these steps to ensure the most rapid and reliable analysis possible for  unknown samples. (2) The instrument must use a thin detector window so that detection of chlorine, sulfur, and phosphorus is optimized. (3) The instrument must have the ability to add user-generated calibration coefficients and to apply this calibration data to future testing or recalculate stored  results.  NEIC requires an instrument that has the ability to calibrate to matrices other than soil if necessary. (4) The instrument must allow the user to add additional elements to the analyte list and to generate additional calibration curves using the Compton Normalization Method.  NEIC  requires an instrument that has the flexibility to add analytes in the field as needed. (5) The instrument must have the ability to meet the following detection limits.  These detection limits are for a soil matrix at the 99.7% confidence level with a 120 second count time.  Phosphorus 2.5% mg/kg  soil; Sulfur 2.5%; Chlorine 2.5%; Potassium 1500; Calcium 1000; Titanium 400; Chromium 100; Iron 200; Nickel 100; Copper 50; Zinc 50; Arsenic 20; Selenium 20; Silver 50; Cadmium 50; Mercury 15; Thallium 50; Lead 20; Barium 2000.  NEIC requires a hand-held instrument to have the ability to detect  these contaminants at regulatory or risk-based levels. (6) The instrument must be a single-module, handheld XRF system.  NEIC requires an instrument light enough for one person to carry while wearing protective equipment conducting on-site XRF analysis.  NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTATION IS  AVAILABLE.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the EPA's requirement stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 15 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered.  Responses to this posting MUST BE IN WRITING.  The email address  for the Point of Contact is schermerhorn.tiffany@epa.gov, and the fax number is (202) 565-2554.

<DESC>National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Genetic Epidemiology Branch (GEB) plans to procure pigmented lesion pathology data, reports, slides and paraffin blocks of lesions from participants in the GEB/NCI Familial Melanoma Research Project that the late Dr. Wallace Clark worked on from Pathology Services, Inc., 640 Memorial Drive, Cambridge, MA  02139.  The primary hallmark of patients affected by familial melanoma, prior to the development of melanoma, is the dysplastic nevus.  This unique pigmented lesion was originally described by Dr. Wallace Clark along with members of the Genetic Epidemiology Branch.  Clinical and pathology studies of these dysplastic nevi continue; the pigmented lesion pathology data, reports, slides and any available paraffin blocks from members of melanoma-prone families who are participants in the GEB/NCI Familial Melanoma Research Project that were in Dr. Clark’s possession at the time of his death need to be returned to the GEB for further study.  Pathology Services Inc is in possession of these items and they must therefore be procured directly from them.  These items are commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can supply the above stated items, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on August 27, 2003.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.  NAICS 541990

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Marine Fisheries Service intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis in accordance with FAR 6.302 with the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, College of William and Mary to examine the potential net benefits and net returns to industry of various regulations that might be proposed because of information obtained from experimental fishing operation.  Contractor to support the analysis of technical and allocative efficiency and the estimation of benefits of fishing practices to mitigate sea turtle interactions, several data bases will be created using the logbooks and survey information obtained from the experimental fisheries.  Part of the work is to assess technical efficiency and fishing capacity in a fishery having an undesirable output.  Typically, firms or fishing vessels having high technical efficiency often have high bycatch rates or actual catches of undesirable outputs (e.g., tuna vessels harming dolphins).  As part of the research, the technical and allocative efficiency and capacity be examined in a way that penalizes the measure of technical efficiency of vessels having high rates of incidental bycatch of sea turtles.  Data envelopment analysis or DEA will be used to assess technical efficiency and capacity.  This research will develop two basic types of bioeconomic models.  The first model will focus on estimating the optimum harvest rate of the three primary species - swordfish, tunas, and sharks-given different constraints on allowable take of sea turtles.  The second model to be explored will be bioeconomic model that directly incorporates the underlying biology of the desirable and undesirable species (i.e., sear turtles).  The following products will be delivered as outputs of the research project:  1. A report summarizing the existing regulations governing sea turtles and commercial fisheries; 2.  A listing of potential regulatory strategies to minimize the incidental take or human interaction with sea turtles by commercial longline fishing activities derived from an analysis of the information obtained from the experimental fisheries; 3.  An analysis of longline technical efficiency and capacity recognizing sear turtles as undesirable outputs within a bioeconomic framework; and 4. An assessment of the potential economic value of protecting sea turtles.  The project will require approximately 24 months, during the first year, items (1) and (2) will be completed.  In year 2, items (3) and (4) will be completed.  Interested parties capable of satisfying this requirement are invited to submit a technical capability statement or proposal and past performance references that clearly demonstrate knowledge and expertise.  The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Telephonic responses shall not be accepted.

<DESC>The National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis in accordance with 603.2 with the University of Colorado at Boulder, Colorado Center for Astrodynamics Research for support related to the "Contribution of Title Gauges to Sea Level Changes Studies."  The NOAA/Office of Global Programs requires a survey of the tide gauges that are in reasonably proximity to GPS or DORIS sites, and then develop estimates of the vertical motion of these sites through a combination of GPS data analysis that NOAA performs, GPS results from other centers, and DORIS results French colleagues.  Part of this work will involve a study of how best to combine each of these datasets.  Also, a rigorous error analysis will be performed so that the vertical crustal motion estimate has realistic error bars.  The final report will contain a table of these vertical crustal motions estimates, as well as an assessment of their impact on sea level change estimates from tide gauges, which shall be submitted at the completion of the project.  This report will present estimates of vertical crustal velocities at select tide gauge sites, and estimate of the errors in these velocities, and an assessment of the impact of these velocities/errors on the title gauge estimates of long-terms sea level change from the tide gauges that can be used for comparisons to similar estimates derived from satellite altimetry. Interested parties capable of satisfying this requirement are invited to submit a technical capability statement or proposal and past performance references that clearly demonstrate knowledge and expertise. The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

STATEMENT TO WORK
For
Economic Impact Study and Report


1. Background

In accordance with the Office of Management & Budget Program Assessment Rating tool (PART) and the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), the Office of the Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman (ONO) will hire services to measure the annual outcomes resulting from each of its core activities.  The ONO core activities are:

1.	Rating Federal Agencies
2.	Processing Small Business Comments
3.	Chairing Public Hearings
4.	Coordinating Regional Volunteer Regulatory Fairness Boards

This statement of work is for the sole purpose of one study, one annual report, and substantiating documents and analysis to measure and report the outcomes resulting from the ONO’s core activities.

2. References: SBREFA, P.L. 104-121, Title II; SBPRA, P.L. 107-98; GPRA, P.L. 103-62 


3. Mission 

ONO’s primary mission is to assist small businesses when they experience excessive Federal regulatory enforcement actions, such as repetitive audits or investigations, excessive fines, penalties, threats, retaliation or other unfair enforcement action by a Federal agency.  We receive comments from small business concerns and act as a liaison between them and Federal agencies.  The comments received from small businesses are forwarded to Federal agencies for high-level review and response.

4. Scope

The scope of the work to be done through this contract is to write original text and layout for printing or digital imaging a report containing up to 250 pages and including, but not limited to, an introduction by the SBA Administrator, a message from the National Ombudsman, an executive summary, a table of contents, an index, charts, graphs, footnotes, credits, quotes, sidebars, detailed ratings of Federal agencies, summaries and highlights of 10 regional Small Business Regulatory Fairness Boards, public meetings and main body.

The report will document and substantiate the economic impact of the ONO core activities.  Each core activity will be examined and analyzed to provide substantiated outcomes measured in:

1.	Money saved for small business owners.
2.	Time saved for small business owners.
3.	Improved Federal agency responsiveness to small business owners.
4.	Changes in the Federal regulatory enforcement environment and their impact on small business and the U.S. economy.
5.	Jobs saved and/or created.
6.	Small business growth, expansion.

In addition, at the discretion of the National Ombudsman, the vender may be directed to provide and substantiate additional outcomes.

The report will include a summary and substantiating evidence that support the conclusions of the study and at least one section on each of the core functions of the ONO, including information provided by the National Ombudsman and/or his designate, other Federal agencies, and the volunteer Regulatory Fairness Boards.  The report shall be easy to read and understand.  Text will be written at sixth to eighth-grade level.

5.  Objectives

ONO seeks a contractor who:

a.	Has prior experience in performing economic impact studies and can provide credible and statistically substantiated economic impacts of specific federal government activities.
b.	Understands SBREFA, SBPRA, GPRA and the Office of Management & Budget’s PART.  In addition, the successful bidder must demonstrate knowledge of the ONO mission and its core activities. 
c.	Can compile and summarize reports, from typed or handwritten notes, minutes from conferences, hearings, roundtables etc., into a book format.
d.	Create executive summaries, charts, graphs, etc., from written materials or from personal interviews.
e.	Be able to receive comments and suggestions from top-level agency officials and meet with other federal agencies to clarify statements on first draft of the report, and re-write report on final draft.
f.	Provide a final product that is grammatically correct, free of any errors, and ready for reproduction.
g.	Professionally layout and prepare approved text and graphics for printing or digital duplication.

6.  Requirements

The study and report document will be made available in draft form to the SBA Administrator, key SBA staff, Federal agency heads and the 50 volunteer RegFair Board Members for comments and suggested changes.  The contractor must be willing, if required, to rewrite, edit, and/or make substantial changes in draft text and graphics to the specification of the National Ombudsman or his/her designate.  Text, graphics, and layout are subject to final approval by the SBA National Ombudsman.  

7.  Timeline

The successful contractor will need to spend substantial time working on-site until the final study and report is completed and approved by the National Ombudsman.  Time is of the essence and, unless authorized by the National Ombudsman, the final study and report must be completed and delivered to the ONO no later than January 1, 2004.

8. Deliverables

The contractor will be required to provide the final study, report, and substantiating documents in Microsoft XP Word electronic format, PDF format, and two 8.5 X 11 hard copies.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service intends to issue a non-competitive purchase order to Johnson Controls, Inc; 2065 Nonconnah Blvd.; Memphis, TN for the retrofit of the existing TOA IC 100 Intercom system at the Memphis IRS Center (MIRSC), Memphis, Tennessee with the AI-900 system or its equivalent.   The new system must be compatible with and integrated into the existing security system at the Memphis IRS Center, Memphis, Tennessee.   The Security System in use at MIRSC is the Cardkey Pegasus 1000, a PC based system with a central processing unit, remote data gathering panels, reader interface modules, closed circuit televisions, multiplexers and video recorders, and printers linked together by communications devices.  The Cardkey system is proprietary to Johnson Controls, therefore, the new intercom system must be capable of interfacing with the Cardkey system and installers must be cleared by Johnson Controls to have access to its proprietary information.  Components of the system include a Main Frame, Master Line Cards, Sub Line Cards, Direct Select Master Station Interface, Direct Select I/O card, PU 200 Power Supply, a Master Station, RS 180 substations, Wall Mount brackets, and Master Rack Power Surge Protection. Installation must start no later than September 15, 2003.   This is not a request for quote.  The Government plans to negotiate with only one source in accirdance with FAR Part 6.302.  Award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 13.   If you feel you have the capability to provide and install the system, you must submit evidence to support your capability within 15 days of this announcement.  Evidence must include documentation that you are a regular distributor for the required components and certification from Johnson Controls granting access to its proprietary information to (a) named individual(s) employed by your company.  A determination not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Responses to Clarification Questions for RFQ 118328 – Automated Palmprint Identification System (APIS)

1.  Item 4 in the solicitation (ITS):  Must support unique identifiers for each records and image: Question:  Specifically what identifiers are required for records and images?  Are they to be specified with the NIST Type 2 record?

The RFQ does not include a requirement for how to specify a unique identifier, however, each record has a unique FBI number and the proposal may elect to use that number. Each image within a record will have a means of identifying what the image is of, e.g., left palm, extreme tip of right ring finger, or lower joints of left index finger. Many of the records will reflect a finger number that corresponds to the standard sequence of finger numbers on a fingerprint card, i.e., 1 is the right thumb, 8 is the left middle.  The proposal should include the solution for uniquely identifying each image within a record. The ANSI/NIST fingerprint standard could be used as a basis for a proposal.

2.  Item 5 ITS:  Must provide means to convert from digital data and provide data entry function for record textual data, e.g., name, sex, race, date of birth, crime or crimes, social security number, palm print classification, fingerprint classification.  Note:  While this capability is required, the actual entry of data into these fields is not mandatory; SCAN:  Question:  Specifically what identifiers are required for records an images?  Are they to be specified with the NIST Type 2 record?

This requirement refers to the textual data associated within a record, e.g. name date of birth, etc. Since each record will have a unique identifier it is not required that all textual fields must have an entry. For example, there will be some records that do not have a date of birth or the race may not be stated on the cards, therefore, it is acceptable that these fields would be blank. The ANSI/NIST Type 2 Record is an acceptable format.

Since the records will have FBI Numbers, it is possible that the textual data can be provided on electronic media and converted without any data entry function. Regardless, a capability must exist for textual data entry for records during and after conversion. 

3.  Item 12 ITS:  Must provide capability to scan images of inked prints at sizes other than 8 inches x 8 inches, at a minimum up to 8.5 inches x 14 inches; Question:  Would the Government please provide sample card formats of all cards intended for input on the system?

Yes, examples will be provided. However, the examples are only to be used for the purpose of this solicitation (RFQ 118328) any other use is prohibited.  Vendors who submitted questions will be faxed the examples.  Any other vendors who are planning to response to this solicitation, should contact the Contracting Officer, Deanna D. Davis, at (202) 324-5552 to request the examples which will faxed to them as well.      

4.  Item 25 ITS:  The system must provide three networked workstations:  Question:  Should all three workstations support 3 dimensional entry as detailed in Specification 8?

All workstations should have the same functionality.

5.  Item 27 ITS:  The System must provide search results within 30 minutes; Question:  Would the Government please specify the daily number of latent encoding and searches?  Would you also please specify the daily number of known palm print input (both by electronic means as well as scanning) after initial conversion?

As research is the primary objective, throughput can be controlled. Therefore, proposals may include a range of throughput parameters and associated cost for each. The proposal should indicate the maximum number of searches that can be performed yet still meet the 30 minute specification. While not a stated requirement, the Government does not anticipate exceeding 100 searches per day; the majority occurring Monday thru Friday between 7:00 a.m., to 6:00 p.m., with peak performance needs from 8:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. The system must be operational 24 hours a day 7 days a week.

6.  Item 35 ITS:  Technical, management and operational data and reporting functionality that will support a research effort to enable the FBI to define requirements for an automated palm print system at a national level must be provided.  Question:  Are any additional guidelines available for supplying these functionalities?

The vendors are in a better position to propose answers to this question than the government. Each vendor most likely performed some type of analysis and research that ultimately resulted in the product design, functionality and performance. The proposal should offer the Government similar strategies to assess this technology that can be used to support designing a national palm print system. 

7.  Reference:  Facsimile quotes will be accepted in accordance with FAR Provision 52.214-31, Facsimile Bids.  Question:  The definition of facsimile bids under FAR 52.214-31(a) appears to authorize the submission of scanned documents via electronic mail.  Will electronically mailed proposals submitted by the proposal due date and time be accepted?  

No, please fax your quote to (202) 324-0570 and follow up by mailing the original to the location stated in the solicitation.  Also, the referenced provision should have been FAR 52.215-5 Facsimile Proposals.

8.  Question:  What is the time frame for the installation?

The proposal must include a delivery schedule. The Government will evaluate the proposed schedule and make decisions for selection and or negotiate the schedule.

9.  Question:  Will the proposal response date be extended?  

Yes.  The Response Date is being extended until September 5, 2003 by 4:00 p.m., EDT. .

10. Question:  Please confirm that the only data from the File Conversion CLIN 2 that will be entered into the system described in CLIN 1 will be one two print palm card, and variable number (one to four, but typically two) fully rolled finger cards.

The records are not standard in number of cards or size. Most, but not all records contain 2 separate palm print cards (one for each palm, backs may be blank) and at least two cards containing impressions for each finger that includes all three joints and the extreme tip area. See 3 above.

11. Question:  Certain specifications listed have an “OPTION” associated with them.  Does the request require the system to meet the Specification and have that OPTION, as a selectable option in the system?  

No, you must meet the specification, but you could submit a proposal that offers the option as a selectable additional feature in the system.

Or should we interpret the specifications such that the OPTION is acceptable in place of or addition to the original Specification.

If the RFQ states that an option is available, the wording of that OPTION clearly indicates whether it must be in addition to the specification. If it does not state that it is in addition to, then the option is to be interpreted as to whether you desire to include that option in your proposal.

12. Question:  In regards to the 100,000 records to be entered into the system, will those 100,000 records be entered by the vendor or by the user?

The initial system load of the converted records will be by the vendor. Modifications (adds, deletes, changes) to the data base after initial system load will be performed by the user.

13. Question:  While the 100,000 record data will be ANSI NIST EFTS compliant, on what digital media will the information be transferred from (i.e. CD, tape, etc.)?  As to the images themselves, with what compression will they be stored on the digital media?

The Government is unable to answer the first question until the vendor providing the conversion service is selected. Proposals should include any limitations or cost factors associated with unacceptable media formats. There will be no compression applied to the images from the conversion process. Refer to Specification 2.

14. Question:  Regarding Specification 2, in addition to the conditions listed; will you accept 1000ppi with FBI certified WSQ compression?

No. The image file must support 1000ppi with no compression. The non-compressed images must be available for display in all user interfaces. However, for the purposes of image processing for feature extraction and other internal nonhuman interface system  processes,  lossless compression is acceptable but must be indicated in the proposal as to when, where, how and how much.

15. Is it possible to fax us an example of the style of card templates that will be used in the creation of the database?    

Yes, See #3 above.

16. Question:  Please clarify Specification 35:  Technical, management and operational data and reporting functionality that will support a research effort to enable the FBI to define requirements for an automated palm print system at a national level must be provided. 

See 6 above. 

17. Item 1 ITS:  Must provide a data base size up to 100,000 records.  A record exists for one individual and consists of an image for each palm (at a minimum, from intedigital area at juncture with fingers to base of wrist), and extreme side of each palm (hypothenar area).  Question:  Where do these records currently reside and how will they be provided to the conversion vendor of choice?

The records exist with the FBI Latent Print Unit in Quantico, VA. They are maintained in 5 drawer file cabinets and are sequenced by FBI number. The proposal should indicate how these records will be handled (if applicable- packaged, transported, secured,etc.).

18. Question:  Is there a preexisting unique numbering scheme associated with each record?  If so, please describe.

Yes, FBI Number.

19. OPTION:  In addition to above, includes tip of fingers to base of wrist.  Question:  Is this image to include a second image for each palm this time including from tip of fingers to base of wrist?

Either approach is acceptable but the proposal must clearly indicate which approach. With separate proposals for conversion and the operating system, the Government must insure that the operating system vendor is capable of handling the images from the conversion vendor.

20. OPTION:  In addition to all of above, includes fully rolled impressions of all three joints of the finger, extreme tips of the fingers, and extreme sides of the fingers for all three joints.  Question:  Our company is capable of capturing, storing, searching and displaying the data and images described.  If possible, please describe the envisioned database storage and image display scheme.

This question goes to the purpose of this research initiative. The Government is looking to assess this very question with the intent to better define an operating system for the FBI and a national system. Flexibility in image display schemes will assist the Government in achieving its objective.

21. OPTION:  Provide the means to create separate files within the database.  These files may contain duplicates from the main database.  Question:  Please define in further detail what is meant by, create separate files within the database What is meant by the, main database?

The main database will be the 100,000 records from conversion. The capability to create separate files within the system of selected records, which may or may not be part of the 100,000 records, is intended to support the need to search against only a predesignated file. These files can be logical or physical, but the proposal must state which approach and the functionality of the capability. If the separate files are created, at initial startup, the total number of records for both the main file and any separate file will not exceed 100,000. If the Government elects to expand up to 1 million records, then these separate files may result in varying numbers of records. 

22. NOTE:  The average record contains six cards consisting of two palm prints (one each for left and right), and four cards containing fully rolled fingerprints of all three joints, extreme sides of these three joints and the extreme tip area for each finger.  Some of these records contain images on both sides.  Many records exceed six cards.  Most records are recorded on 8 inches x 8 inches cards; however, some are recorded on 8.5 inches x 11 inches paper.  Question:  Is it possible to obtain sample records?

Yes, See 3 above.

23. Item 4 ITS:  Must support unique identifiers for each record and image.  Question:  Please describe the existing unique identifiers associated with the database of records to be converted (if any).

The proposal may offer a solution, but the current file uses the FBI number. (see 18 above.)

24. Item 7 ITS:  Must provide means to replace images.  Question:  Is our assumption correct that by, replace images you mean subsequent to a search which reveals lower quality images contained within a preexisting record in the database?  Please elaborate.

This could be one scenario, but the specification is more generic in that at any time the user (with controls and safeguards) desires to replace a record, functionality exists to achieve it.

25. Item 11 ITS:  Images must be oriented in an upright position, i.e., interdigital area at top of image, Note:  If palm print images on digital media appear on their sides or upside down (or any degree less than upright), then the system must automatically orient the palm print in an upright position.  Question:  By automatically orient do you mean during the conversion process, candidate image display or match verification?  Please elaborate.

The system must be able to orient a print to an upright position. However, a proposal including functionality that provides additional  benefit for the candidate image display or match verification process is acceptable.
 
26. Item 24 ITS:  Performance analysis tools to assist in assessing accuracy, both hits and misses, must be provided.  Question:  Please provide examples of a performance analysis tool.

The vendors are in a better position to propose answers to this question than the government. Each vendor most likely performed some type of analysis and research that ultimately resulted in the product design, functionality and performance. The proposal should offer the Government similar strategies to assess this technology that can be used to support designing a national palm print system. For example, if a search results in a missed identification when, in fact, the record is contained within the data base, then a tool to assist in determining the cause of the miss and a means to record and track that information could be proposed.

27. Item 25 ITS:  SYSTEM 25.  The system must provide three networked workstations and be net workable to support up to seven additional workstations.  Question:  Please describe the network envisioned.

The system and all workstations will be contained within one building. The proposals must state a network design and any limitations.

28. Item 26 ITS:  The system must support the capability to import export data; as complete records, as images in ANSI NIST EFTS format, as an interface to other APIS systems, as a record to file.  Question:  By complete record, do you mean as defined in Section 1 of the RFQ?  Please elaborate.

Yes.

29. Item 27 ITS:  The system must provide search results within 30 minutes.  Question:  Please define the type of search in question.  Also, please provide pertinent peak load and throughput requirements envisioned for the system.

See 5 above.

30. Item 29 ITS:  The system must be scalable up to 1 million records.  Question:  Is the system to have a database capacity of 1 million records as defined in Section 1 upon delivery or rather have the ability to be expanded to that capacity in the future?  Please elaborate.

To be expandable up to 1million records in the future.

31.  Item 33 ITS:  Training must be provided for up to six individuals.  Question:  Are all of the students to be trained latent examiners or are some system administrators?  Please elaborate.

Students include latent print examiners, researchers and administrators.

<DESC>The purpose of this solicitation modification is to provide answers to questions which are as follows;

Questions and Answers - Part 1
Ref#03-811-7357
Motion Control/Driver etc…

Question 1:  Based on the straightness requirement, we assume an encoder accuracy of 0.2 micrometers is required?

Answer: NIST is not sure how the straightness requirement affects the encoder accuracy.  You can approximate the error in the axis of travel (y axis) if NIST says that the stage goes off 1.5 micrometers in a perpendicular axis (x axis) and travels 80 % of 100 mm in this "wrong" direction.    The true y axis travel would be square root[ (8e4)^2 - (1.5)^2) ], which is about 79.99999999 mm; an error of about 14 nm.  So, the encoder accuracy is not based on straightness.

The requirement is for  "travel resolution, minimum incremental motion <= 100 nm," therefore, the encoder accuracy must be adequate to support that, namely 100 nm.

Question 2: We assume the 1.5 micrometer straightness is required about all three axes?
Answer:  The straightness would be in the two axes orthogonal to the direction of motion.

Question 3:  What is the nominal and max speed required?
Answer:  speed range: 0.01 micrometer/s to 100 mm/s

Question 4:  What is the required acceleration rate?
Answer: acceleration range: 0.001 g to 0.25 g

Question 5:  What is the max load that will be carried by this stage?
Answer:  340 N (nominal)

Question 6:  Can we work with you to assure that our proposal is complete and correctly formatted?
Answer:  NIST does not have a standard format for vendors to follow.  The only advice that can be given is for all potential offerors to provide all the information that is requested in the Request for Quotation (RFQ).

Question 7:  The references we intend to send are non-government.  Is there any penalty for this?
Answer: No

<ARCHDATE>11072003
<CONTACT>Jane Calicari, (732)427-7077
<DESC>NA Request for Information (RFI) For Sense Through the Wall (STTW) Technologies Date: 29 July 2003 Contact:  U.S Army Communications Electronics Research Development & Engineering Center (CERDEC), Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD), Wilbur Chin, ph: (732) 532-8725, email: Wilbur.Chin@us.army.mil, or Kim Black, ph: (732) 427-2728, em ail: Kim.Black@us.army.mil  Synopsis:  Request for Information for Sense Through the Wall White Papers Description:   The I2WD is collecting information on sensor technologies that have the potential to achieve all or many of the objectives of the first phase of a proposed Suite of Sense Through The Wall (STTW) systems Science and Technology Objective (STO) .  The I2WD is currently conducting market research only.  No award is intended as a result of this synopsis nor does the Government intend to pay for information received.  The I2WD is interested in receiving information with regard to existing sense thro ugh the wall technologies that can be leveraged as the basis for a new STO regarding STTW systems.   The Suite of STTW systems will explore candidate technologies to provide mounted/dismounted users with the capability to detect, locate, and 'see' personnel with concealed weapons and explosives who are hidden behind walls, doors and other visible obstruct ions.  This capability has direct application to both US Army and Special Forces requirements for military operations in urban terrain (MOUT), prisoner/checkpoint screening and hostage recovery operations.  A Suite of STTW prototypes will be developed as p art of the STO.  One version will be soldier borne, and modularly designed to facilitate integration into a Future Combat System (FCS) Small Unmanned Ground Vehicle (SUGV).  A second configuration will be mounted on a larger FCS Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UG V) and will have increased standoff distance from the target area.  The Suite of STTW systems will provide: near real time situational awareness information, increased standoff distance without sacrificing probability of detection, geo-location data on mul tiple targets, detection of moving and stationary targets; detection of multiple targets in the presence of clutter, detection of concealed weapons and concealed explosives from a standoff distance, detection of targets through various wall materials (incl uding dense materials with higher attenuation properties),  and be capable of operation while on the move.   Ideally, the STTW sensors should not have any electromagnetic interference impact on any sensors or communications devices presently fielded to DOD  components.   The Suite of STTW systems STO is proposed for an FY04 start and consists of a two-phase approach with prototype deliveries in 3QFY06 (Phase I) and 3QFY08 (Phase II). Phase I Description:  FY04-06 Near real time situational awareness information Achieve Probability of Detection  Improve Standoff capability  Detect multiple targets through multiple wall types in presence of clutter Detect targets in motion and stationary targets Develop user-friendly interface (i.e. audible alerts to cue user to look at display) Improve Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) (i.e. icon displays for detected targets with geo-location information) Improve Geo-location accuracy of targets Operation on the Move capability Deliver Prototypes NLT 3QFY06 -	Soldier borne version (detect personnel through walls) -	SUGV mounted version (detect personnel through walls) -	UGV mounted version (detect personnel through walls, detect concealed weapons and explosives on personnel) Test Prototypes in lab and MOUT facility 4QFY06 (TRL 6) Phase II Description:  FY06-08 Adds the following to Phase I capabilities: Detect concealed weapons and explosives behind walls in urban environment  Increase standoff capability with no decrease in Probability of Detection  Develop integrated STTW system (detect personnel, concealed weapons and explosives through wall s) Develop common GUI Deliver Suite of STTW Prototypes NLT 3QFY08 -	Soldier borne version (detect personnel, concealed weapons and explosives through walls) -	SUGV mounted version (detect personnel, concealed weapons and explosives through walls) -	UGV mounted version (detect personnel, concealed weapons and explosives on personnel through walls) Test Prototypes in lab and MOUT facility 3Q-4QFY08 (TRL 6) Multiple technologies are being considered for this STO such as:  multi-band and multi-mode radar systems, x-ray, millimeter wave sensors, magnetometers, and acoustic techniques.  The I2WD is receptive to new technologies for this application, but they mus t be capable of being developed into Technology Readiness Level 6 (TRL 6) prototypes by the end of  Phase I and Phase II of the STO.  The specific requirements of the Suite of STTW Systems STO are classified SECRET-NOFORN.  Offerors that would like to submit white papers describing their abilities to meet the STO requirements should request the second part of the RFI package, which is cl assified SECRET- NOFORN.  This can be obtained by submitting a letter of interest via email to the Government POCs listed in the first paragraph.  The Letter of Interest should also include the following information:  FACILITY SECURITY OFFICER FACILITY ADDRESS FACILITY CAGE CODE Once we have verified the security clearance of the offerors facility, the classified section of the RFI will be mailed to the offeror. The response should describe the technical approach proposed by the offeror, the STO objectives being addressed by the t echnology/technologies (the offeror may elect to respond to all or a portion of the STO objectives), existing or projected performance capabilities and availability of any prototype hardware suitable for testing in a field environment for Phase I of the ST TW systems STO.  The description of the technical approach should describe the phenomenology being exploited for STTW detection and geo-location.  The description should also include explicitly or by reference each mathematical equation as used by the offe ror to establish the anticipated system performance.  The response to the RFI should also include any test data against various structures (if available) and a rough order of magnitude cost estimate for development and/or fabrication of a single Phase I pr ototype system.   The Government also requests that each offeror provide a mathematical analysis of future performance capabilities of a Phase II STTW system in advance of the start of Phase II of the STTW STO (starting in FY06). The analysis should fully document the proje cted size, weight, power and performance of an STTW system that could be delivered as a TRL 6 prototype in FY08.  The performance parameters for the Phase II system should be accompanied by sufficient rationale for the Government to verify the offerors cla ims.  Responses to this RFI should be no more than 20 single sided pages, excluding any available test data.    The Government is not interested in general company capability information and will not accept such submissions.  Submissions will be accepted via e-mail only and should be sent to both addressees above.  Questions concerning this RFI should be directed to  the above mentioned POCs via email. Definitions for Technology Readiness Level 5 and 6: TRL 5.  Component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment	Fidelity of breadboard technology increases significantly.  The basic technological components are integrated with reasonably realistic supporting elements so that the technology can be  tested in simulated environment.  Examples include 'high fidelity' laboratory integration of components. TRL 6.  System/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment. Representative model or prototype system, which is well beyond the breadboard tested for level 5, is tested in a relevant environment.  Represents a major step up in a tec hnol ogies demonstrated readiness.  Examples include testing a prototype in a high fidelity laboratory environment or in a simulated operational environment.

<DESC>This Notice is intended to Notify the Public and any Interested Parties of the Intension of Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), to Issue a Request For Proposals (RFP) in October or November 2003, for a Sole Source Contract for DYNASMART-P technical support, to be provided by the software developer, University of Maryland.  DYNASMART-P represents a new generation of tools in support of traffic operations and planning decisions in the ITS and non-ITS environments.  The model algorithms are new and complex to the user community.  Therefore, providing adequate technical support becomes essential.  Currently, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is planning to release DYNASMART-P through McTrans and to provide technical support, through UMD.  The main objectives of this project are (1) to provide training courses on DYNASMART-P, (2) to provide technical support to the FHWA and DYNASMART-P users and (3) to refine DYNASMART-P.  This will be a three-year project with one base year and two option years.  The FHWA will assess the needs for providing technical support for each option year on a yearly basis. The approximate performance period of this project will be from April  2004 through March  2007.  

The FHWA R&D initiated a Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) research project to meet these data needs and to address complex traffic control and management issues in the information-based, dynamic ITS environment. Under this project, two prototypes of Traffic Estimation and Prediction System for Operations Planning (TrEPS-P) have been developed. These two prototypes (DynaMIT-P and DYNASMART-P) were developed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the University of Maryland (UMD), respectively.  Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), the DTA project manager designated by the FHWA, completed a laboratory evaluation of both prototypes in June 2000. DYNASMART-P was recommended for further field test and public release.  Based on the recommendation, UMD completed the field test of DYNASMART-P using the planning datasets provided by the Knoxville Metropolitan Transportation Commission in August 2002.  Currently the FHWA and UMD are conducting a beta test of DYNASMART-P.  Upon completion of the beta test, DYNASMART-P will be refined and packaged for release in early 2004.  

Telephoned, E-Mailed, Faxed, Or Letter Requests for the RFP (Request for Proposals) Will Not Be Accepted.   Instead, when released, all prospective offerors are to obtain the RFP from FedBizOpps at http://www.eps.gov.  Any subsequent Amendments to the RFP will Likewise be published in FedBizOpps at the Internet address cited above, and the FHWA does Not plan to mail out any Hard copies of any such Amendments. Therefore, it shall be the responsibility of each offeror to closely and frequently Monitor FedBizOpps for any Amendments to the RFP which, will be absolutely Essential for all prospective offerors, since Amendments usually contain crucial information.

<DESC>JANITORIAL SERVICES
The US Postal Service is requesting information from experienced suppliers of building services to determine the feasibility of establishing national and/or regional contracts for Janitorial Services to the Postal Service at up to 2500 small to mid-sized Postal facilities (up to approximately 20,000 square feet) across the continental U.S.  

This is not a Request for Proposals.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only, and does not constitute a contracted commitment.  The Postal Service will assume no liability for costs incurred by suppliers in providing information for this request. 

The Postal Service is looking for information on how you think your business would provide cleaning services to meet our needs.

Interested parties are asked to respond, in writing, to this Request for Information (RFI).  Response packages must include specific details to sufficiently address the firm's proposed process of providing janitorial services to the Postal Service, considering the information provided in this RFI.

At a future time, a solicitation may be issued, with subsequent award to one or more vendors, and may be on a statewide, regional, or other large geographical area basis, depending on vendor capabilities.  (If a solicitation is issued for this type of requirement, we will be seeking companies that have the necessary organization, experience, capacity, controls, acceptable past performance, finances, and accounting and operations controls to handle the size of any specific contract.)  

The following information is provided to help you in your response.

Contracts are awarded for a base period of two years, with four 2-year renewal options. 

Contracts are currently based on Frequency of Performance and Facility Inventory forms that are tailored specifically for each site.  There may also be a Statement of Work varying from a simple single page to a more complex multiple page process. (See Item 11 below about these forms.)  This could include any combination of hours and days per week.  (i.e. 3 hours a day M-F, or 5 hours a day M-Saturday, or 2 hours a day MWF, etc.) 

Annual spend for the 2500 locations where the dollar commitment is over $10,000 a year is approximately $37,000,000 at the current time.  The current contracted national average work week is 24 hours, and the national average price per hour is approximately $12.

Contracts under $10,000 a year are generally handled as Local Agreements, with vendor selection and award made at the local site.  This local process covers janitorial services at about 12,000 smaller Postal sites.  All other sites are handled by Postal Service employees.

Cleaning does not include any repair, alteration, or improvement work at the facilities, and cleaners are not directed to perform any duties outside the scope of the contract. 

The following is information to consider in your submittal. 

1.	Capability/Capacity.  The supplier must have the ability to provide janitors over a substantial part of a state, region, or of the nation.  Suppliers must include information outlining their current specific capability and capacity, but must also sufficiently describe their proposal to either replace the existing Postal Service process of  direct contracting for janitorial services, or what will be required by a company to use the existing cleaners in place, or any other proposed process.
2.	Program Management and Service Capability.  Suppliers must include information outlining the proposed contract management structure.  Provide a narrative description of the proposed approach to assure quality control of the services provided and the timeliness of the service including the network used to provide janitors at various locations
3.	Service Capabilities.  Suppliers must provide adequate information outlining their network, including an explanation of the contractual relationships between the supplier and its distribution network.  Suppliers must provide a narrative description detailing how service support will be managed, including quality control, monitoring performance levels, providing no-show replacements, and appropriate problem response management. 
4.	Supplier Diversity Program.  The Postal Service is committed to seeking out and providing opportunities for small, minority, and women-owned businesses through direct contract awards and subcontracting opportunities.  Supplier Diversity plays an importance role in promoting economic development in communities, while helping the Postal Service get the top quality products and services we need to serve the American public.  Each prospective supplier will have to provide information regarding their firm's supplier diversity and subcontracting opportunity programs.  
5.	The Postal Service will provide most supplies and equipment for the janitors to use.  (One exception is gas and lawn mower, if mowing is included as a minor part of the contract.)
6.	All workers on Postal property must have a background check and be drug tested.
7.	Work must be performed while Postal personnel are present.
8.	The Postal Service uses an EDI system called e-Buy and expects a company to be able to access this to receive orders and handle the accounting and payment process.
9.	Payments will be by EFT.
10.	Department of Labor Wage Rates will apply and will need to be obtained and monitored bi-annually, by the supplier, for each site where work is performed.
11.	Samples of Blank Frequency of Cleaning and Inventory of Cleaning forms may be requested from the address below, or by phoning or e-mailing the Team Leader at the number provided below.  E-mail is the preferred method, since we can send the attachments by return e-mail.  (We do want your mailing address, though.) 


THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND NO AWARD WILL BE ISSUED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: 	Response packages must be submitted to:

<DESC>Westinghouse Savannah River Company (WSRC), managing contractor of the Savannah River Site near Aiken, South Carolina, for the Department of Energy, is soliciting expressions of interest from companies wishing to obtain license rights to market and distribute the following technology to commercial customers.  License rights may be granted on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  WSRC also may be available to assist in further research and development of the technology under a cooperative research and development agreement and/or may provide technical assistance during commercialization of the technology under a license agreement.  The technology is the Directed Spray Mast, a remotely operated tank cleaning device for use in limited areas.  This technology was originally conceived to eliminate the inherent dangers involved with sending workers into storage or process tanks during cleaning operations.  The directed spray mast was designed to provide more precise cleaning of problem buildup areas within a tank versus the more global cleaning approach of existing technologies.  This device should be useful for cleaning applications such as, slurry tanks for food processing, fermentation tanks for beverage manufacturing, paint and textile processing vessels, batch process tanks for chemical manufacturing, and hazardous waste storage tank uses.  Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by email) no later than September 19, 2003, summarizing the company’s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.  Qualified companies will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed nondisclosure agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a license will be required to submit a business plan prior to licensee selection and negotiations.  Company qualifications should include, but not be limited to, compatible product lines, sufficient manufacturing capacity, sound product develop plan, reasonable schedule for product launch, established distribution networks, evidence of sufficient financial resources for product development and launch.  Questions and expressions of interest may be addressed to the Point of Contact identified in this Notice:  Dale K. Haas, telephone (803) 725-4185; fax: (803) 725-4988; email: dale.haas@srs.gov; or address: Westinghouse Savannah River Company, Building 773-41A, Room #238, Aiken, SC  29808.  This is not a procurement; it is a request for parties interested in licensing opportunities only.

<DESC>17(i).  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, and
FAR 13.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   17(ii).  USZA92-03-T-0053 is the solicitation number and it is issued as a Request for quotation (RFQ).  17(iii).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-15.  17(iv)  This procurement is unrestricted.  All responses from responsible sources will be fully considered.  17(v).  This action (CLIN 0001) is for one contract SIGNET/EW systems trainer for a 12 month period to begin during the month of September 2003.  17(vi)  PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT FOR United States Army Special Operations Command Signals Intelligence (SIGINT)/Electronic Warfare (EW) Trainer.  1.0 SCOPE. General. a. The United States Army Special Operations Command (USASOC) is responsible for the training, equipping and readiness of Army special operations forces.  As part of an equipment procurement strategy to ensure that the Special Operations Teams – Alpha (SOT-A) remain a valuable and viable component of the special forces groups, USASOC has purchased a variety of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) Signals Intelligence (SIGINT)/Electronic Warfare (EW) equipment for use by the SOT-As.  Most of this non-standard equipment has been issued in small quantities to various units based on mission requirements.  The resultant mix of low density equipment provides the SOT-As with an enhanced capability but poses serious training challenges.  There is no institutional training solution within USASOC or the Army.  The requirement is for one contract SIGINT/EW systems trainer.  b. The contractor shall develop a program of instruction (POI) for training SOT-A members the tactics, techniques and procedures for collecting and exploiting sophisticated signals using specified non-TO&E equipment issued to the SIGINT/EW collection teams assigned to the Special Forces Groups.  The POI will be a deliverable that will become and remain the property of USASOC.  	c. The contractor shall travel to various special operations forces’ unit locations to conduct training to SIGINT/EW collection team members (Army and Navy) on the tactics, techniques and procedures for collecting and exploiting sophisticated signals using specified non-TO&E equipment issued to the Special Forces Groups.  	d. The contractor shall assist in the development of SIGINT/EW-specific proficiency standards that may be used as a component of a certification program for the SOT-A members.  2.0 PERSONNEL.  	a.

The contractor shall not employ any person who is an employee of the United States Government if the employment of that person would create a conflict of interest.  	f. The contractor is cautioned that off duty active military personnel hired under this contract may be subject to permanent change of station (PCS), change in duty hours or deployment. Military Reservists and National Guard members may be subject to recall to active duty. Their absence at any time shall not constitute an excuse for nonperformance under this contract.  3.0 QUALITY CONTROL.  a.

The written minutes of these meetings shall be signed by the contractor's manager, contracting officer and COR. Should the contractor not concur with the minutes, the contractor shall so state any areas of non-concurrence in writing to the Contracting Officer within 10 calendar days of receipt of the signed minutes.  4.0 QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.  	a.
