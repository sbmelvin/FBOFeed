<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK
	
	
A.  BACKGROUND AND NEED

The Business Responds to AIDS/Labor Responds to AIDS (BRTA/LRTA) Programs are a worldwide public/private partnership, which serves as a resource to business and labor on a full range of HIV/AIDS issues through the provision of technical assistance and implementation of comprehensive HIV/AIDS prevention workplace programs that combat complacency and stigma and support community activism, volunteerism and corporate philanthropy.

By the end of 2001, 40 million people were living with HIV globally, of whom 37.2 million are adults in their most productive years.  There were 5 million new HIV infections in 2001.  In the United States, close to 1 million people are currently infected and some 40,000 new infections occur each year.  The potential impact of this global epidemic could equal 1.4% of the world gross domestic product annually.  Due to today’s global markets, the costs of the epidemic overseas will be felt domestically as well.  Every workplace will experience the consequences of this pandemic.  
                                                                  Education is our best method of preventing HIV infection, and the workplace offers an excellent forum for teaching prevention messages.  Employers are a highly credible source of information for employees. Surveys have shown that employees think more highly of those employers that offer workplace education programs.  Today's workplace offers access to people of every race and ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, and age since all segments of the population are found in the workplace. More than half (55%) of American workers are between 25 and 44 years of age. Three-quarters (75%) of the people reported with AIDS are in that same age group. The workplace offers unique access to this concentration of the age-appropriate population as well as their families and the communities in which they reside.  

Changes in the HIV/AIDS epidemic, such as steady infection rates coupled with more people living and working longer, are intensifying the workplace challenge to combat and address HIV/AIDS.  With medical treatment, HIV positive employees can manage the infection as a chronic long-term condition.  This will result in more HIV-positive employees on the job in the future.  This inevitably focuses more attention on HIV as a workplace issue.  In addition, HIV/AIDS is having a devastating impact on the global economy, affecting the workplace both domestically and internationally.  Coupled with survey data that indicate employers can be viewed as an extremely credible source of HIV/AIDS information when worksite training is presented with the full endorsement of management and that employees want their employers to offer HIV workplace education (73%) and are willing to participate in programs that could help their children (54%), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to provide the Business Responds to AIDS (BRTA) and the Labor Responds to AIDS (LRTA) Programs.

CDC launched the BRTA Program in 1992 with a nationally broadcasted teleconference down linked and viewed at more than 1,200 sites, reaching businesses, labor organizations, universities and American Red Cross offices.  The Labor Responds to AIDS Program was launched in conjunction with the union movement in 1994.  Although these programs were initially established for domestic use, there is now an increasing demand by multi-national corporations for their implementation globally.
									
B.  CONTRACT PURPOSE

To assist CDC in engaging business and labor sectors in a comprehensive and collaborative effort with other key partners to enhance the health, productivity, and well being of workers and their families living with, affected by, or at risk for HIV/AIDS through implementation of workplace and related programs.
	
C.	SCOPE OF WORK

The contractor shall provide the supplies, services, skills, contacts, knowledge, and experience to assist CDC in engaging U.S and multi-national business and labor leaders in comprehensive workplace programs designed to educate employees, their families, and their communities about HIV prevention.  Specific goals are as follows:

1.	 To increase public understanding of, involvement in, and support for HIV/AIDS prevention in the workplace.
2.	To increase business and labor’s understanding of, involvement in, and support for HIV/prevention in the workplace.
3.	To prevent or reduce behaviors or practices that place persons at risk for HIV infection, or if already infected, place others at risk.
4.	To increase individual knowledge of HIV serostatus and improve referral and resource systems to appropriate prevention services.
5.	To build and maintain the necessary State, local, and community support infrastructure and technical capacity to carry out the necessary workplace prevention programs.
6.	To increase technical assistance and capacity building efforts in business and labor union workplaces provided through consultation, training, written materials, and large and small group meetings.
7.	To increase health education and risk reduction through the BRTA/LRTA Manager’s and Labor Leader’s Kits.  These kits direct business managers and supervisors and labor leaders to provide resources in the workplace for persons or their families/friends whose behaviors or personal circumstances place them at high risk.
8.	To evaluate and conduct research activities as necessary to conduct formative, process, outcome, and impact evaluation of HIV workplace prevention education.
9.	To train and assure high quality of activities which focus on capacity building within businesses and unions, as well as grantees.  Grantees routinely assess the performance and training needs of staff that provide HIV prevention services.  Comprehensive quality assurance procedures and standards produce feedback, including review of relevant program data and client satisfaction services.
10.	To market and communicate to national, multi-national, community, business, and labor groups delivering activities designed to deliver messages that promote HIV prevention as well as improve the effectiveness of specific intervention efforts.  Prevention marketing and health communication activities frequently involve the integration of behavioral science, target population involvement, community participation, and social marketing principles in the design.  The focus in most of these efforts is on using social marketing and health communications to support social norms that foster HIV/AIDS workplace education prevention programs to encourage the adoption of behaviors that reduce the likelihood of HIV transmission.
11. 	 To disseminate information encompassing information on HIV/AIDS prevention in the workplace to both consumers and gatekeepers.  This is done through various mechanisms, including the operation of the Business and Labor Resource Service (BLRS).  The BLRS is a clearinghouse and contains the databases for all workplace materials programs, etc.   These services provide a variety of information and materials including CDC publications, brochures, posters, videos, access to scientific information published in various scientific journals, daily news summaries, access to information about national regional, state and local HIV/AIDS prevention service providers.

<SUBJECT>A -- REAL-WORLD REASONING (REAL)
<SOLNBR>BAA03-34
<RESPDATE>070704
<ARCHDATE>07222004
<CONTACT>Sri Kumar, DARPA Program Manager, Phone 000-000-0000, Fax 703-741-7804, Email none
<DESC>The DARPA Information Processing Technology Office (IPTO) solicits innovative proposals for a new program on Real-World Reasoning.  A principal mission of IPTO, launched at DARPA in 2002, is to create the technologies critical to building practical cognitive information processing systems. Developing innovative machine reasoning technology that can effectively deal with the real world is central to this mission.

The objective of the REAL-WORLD REASONING (REAL) program is to explore and develop foundations, technology, and tools to enable effective, practical automated reasoning of the scale and complexity required for computers to perform complex tasks in the real world requiring intelligence.  Effective, “real-world” machine reasoning requires inference in environments that are far more complex in scale and scope than those tackled by current machine reasoning methods.  Enduring real-world systems need to deal with vast amounts of knowledge and information, often concerning dynamic and intentional phenomena. In addition, beliefs about the environment are often uncertain and involve plausible but not provable assumptions. The REAL program solicits innovative research efforts that can make fundamental and breakthrough advances in real-world reasoning to deal with these and related problems. Research efforts must implement the algorithms and technology in specific testbeds, and demonstrate novel capabilities for real-world reasoning.

Specifically, the program intends to:
 
1. Develop and demonstrate innovative techniques that push the envelope of performance of reasoning engines, in terms of the scale of the problems that can be dealt with, and the speed and correctness of reasoning.

2. Explore, develop, and demonstrate novel methods that extend the breadth of reasoning to deal with
a. Uncertain and dynamic environments where the knowledge base is characterized by uncertain and temporally changing information; and,b.Strategic environments characterized by goals and intentions of many interacting agents and actors, in both cooperative and non-cooperative contexts.

3.Build and demonstrate embedded reasoners for active knowledge bases that recognize the commonalities and similarities among multiple ontologies, and combine and merge them, so as to enable well-informed reasoning through the exploitation of all information in the knowledge base.

The program duration is anticipated to be five years. The research plan for this BAA is structured in three phases. The Phase I effort is planned for an 18-month period; Phase II, for 18 months thereafter; and Phase III, for the final 24 months of the program. For each phase, proposals should clearly identify and describe the project’s goals, approaches, milestones, testbeds, demonstrations, and cost. Proposers must structure their proposals to fit into one, two, or all of the three phases.

Proposers MUST obtain a copy of the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP), and respond to ALL items in the PIP when preparing the proposal. A copy of the PIP may be obtained from:

http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/Solicitations/index.html

Research is sought in the following three topics:

Topic 1: High-performance reasoning techniques 
Topic 2: Expanding the breadth of reasoning and hybrid methods
Topic 3: Embedded reasoners for active knowledge bases
 
Proposals may address one or more of the above topics, but must clearly identify the topics addressed and describe the proposed research for each separately.  In the following, the topics are described in detail.

Topic 1: High-performance reasoning techniques

We seek innovative research efforts that explore and develop methods that push the envelope of performance of reasoning engines. Metrics to measure performance should be clearly specified in the proposal, including the scale of the underlying knowledge bases for the reasoning environment (such as number of entities, variables, rules, etc.), the speed of answering queries (for example, query response time using a 1-GHz processor), and the correctness in answering queries (such as fraction of queries answered correctly in a specified time interval).

It is desired that the Phase I research emphasize new high-performance inference methods for propositional knowledge bases. It is suggested that later phases build on the successes of core research in Phase I, and this includes extending the research to further performance improvements in propositional knowledge bases, as well as to high-performance reasoning in other systems such as first-order and higher-order logic, or fragments of such systems.

Proposals should clearly specify the performance targets, outline the technical approaches, and clearly present arguments and evidence to establish how the proposed approaches have the potential of reaching the specified target performance. 

Methods for high performance may be based on any technical approach, but generic applicability to any knowledge base is important, and in particular for any propositional system in Phase I. Of particular interest are approaches based on models of computational complexity that characterize the computational hardness profile, or regimes of different complexities, of a given reasoning situation. Such an approach may exploit the hardness profile of a problem, and the knowledge base structure, to design new reasoning architectures and computationally tractable inference methods to deal with intrinsically high-complexity regimes, via systematic and well-characterized approximations or modifications of the reasoning environment, while minimally compromising other desirable dimensions of performance. Generic learning methods that enable scaling and speed-up of inference in any context are also of interest, as are methods that exploit combinations and interactions of different knowledge representations, and parallel reasoning, to obtain performance gains.   

Proposals should quantify the performance targets for reasoning methods, in each phase. For example, a target for Phase I may be the ability to perform reasoning in propositional knowledge bases in excess of 10K variables and 40K rules, with 85 percent or higher rate of questions answered correctly, and a query response time of  seconds on a 2.5-GHz processor.  In Phases II and III, proposals may address methods for further performance scaling of propositional reasoning (for example, Phase II might address methods for improving query response time in a knowledge base ten times the size of knowledge bases considered in Phase I, with a Phase III scaling target of an additional ten times or more), and improved rate of correct answers (for example, in excess of 90%). Extensions to other knowledge bases such as first-order logic and fragments of such systems are also of interest in later phases. While this example is suggestive of the specification of performance targets, bidders are encouraged to propose all key relevant performance targets and methods that push the performance envelope maximally. 

Proposed new reasoning methods should be demonstrated in a testbed. While performers may adopt their own testbed for developing their ideas for generic high-performance reasoning (which should be described in the proposal), DARPA is interested in testing and evaluating the reasoning methods to be developed in each phase of this topic in a common testbed. Performers will be required to demonstrate their new methods in such a common testbed, which will be made available to the performers. Such a common testbed may be drawn, for example, from the domain of chess, where the reasoning challenge problems may involve answering queries such as whether or not there exists a checkmate in a specified number of moves, starting from a mid-game position with a specified number and types of pieces for each player, within a specified response time window (for example, five seconds on a 2.5-GHz processor), and with associated explanations. Proposers are strongly encouraged to translate their proposed milestones to specific capabilities to be accomplished in the above mid-game chess problem (for example, Phase I target may translate as follows: finding the existence of a checkmate in ten moves with five pieces for each player placed in arbitrary positions on the board). While this common testbed may be drawn from the domain of chess, it should be noted that the program emphasizes generic reasoning methods and not techniques specific to the testbed domain.

Topic 2: Expanding the breadth of reasoning and hybrid methods.

The goal of research in this topic is to develop foundations and methods that significantly expand the breadth of reasoning critical to practical cognitive information processing systems. This includes developing efficient techniques for reasoning in uncertain, dynamic, and intentional environments, as well as hybrid reasoning methods. Strategic reasoning methods and tools that support reasoning in multi-player contexts are also of interest. 

This topic comprises three sub-topics:

Reasoning in uncertain and dynamic environments: Research is sought in the development of efficient and scalable methods for temporal reasoning under uncertainty for large knowledge bases. Of interest are methods for effectively representing uncertain information and relations among temporally evolving entities, as well as algorithms that support rich query-processing and predictive reasoning. Methods for assessing the states of unobserved entities in partially observed systems are of interest. Fast inference methods that can scale to large knowledge bases are important. Proposals should specify the target knowledge base size, and target query response time (say, on a 1-GHz processor). Approaches may include dynamic Bayesian networks that exploit the inference problem structure, and the use of systematic approximations. Non-monotonic reasoning methods that can effectively deal with dynamic changes to identities of items in the knowledge base, and deontic reasoning to deal with changes to the rules are also of interest. Proposals should clearly identify the metrics and milestones, and describe the testbed and demonstrations for program phases, and how the proposed approaches can potentially meet the milestones. For example, a Phase I target may be to develop and demonstrate the foundations and methods for temporal reasoning under uncertainty in a knowledge base of a certain size (e.g., 10K state variables), target response time on a specified processor (e.g., order of seconds on a 1-GHz processor), and error in state estimation (e.g., less than 10 per cent). Further scaling (e.g., 10X, 100X knowledge base size) and improvements in metrics may be addressed in additional phases. Proposals that address non-monotonic and deontic reasoning should specify the metrics and milestones, capturing the underlying implementation tradeoffs. 

Hybrid reasoning: The goal in this topic is to develop innovative methods for hybrid reasoning that effectively combine multiple methods of reasoning to exploit advantages provided by different approaches. Example approaches include deductive inference, probabilistic reasoning, temporal reasoning, reasoning by analogy, etc. Methods that combine mental models with logic reasoners to exploit potential advantages of human-like reasoning, as well as methods for combining multiple theories, are also of interest. Hybrid reasoners that act on different partitions of the knowledge base (for example, partitioning by domain, time, and space), and methods for efficient dynamic composition of reasoners, are also solicited. Also of interest are hybrid methods that combine probabilistic and relational reasoning.  Proposals must clearly identify approaches to addressing the technical challenges, and describe the metrics, milestones, and testbed for demonstrations, in each phase.  An example milestone may be to develop and demonstrate, in Phase I, a hybrid reasoning system with specified types of interacting reasoners in a knowledge base of certain size (e.g., 100K variables), with order of seconds query response time on a 1-GHz processor, and demonstrate performance benefits and new functionality not possible otherwise. It is suggested that research in Phases II and III address combining methods that are successfully developed in Phase I. 


Strategic Reasoning: The goal of this topic is to develop methods for reasoning in strategic multi-player or multi-agent contexts where agents may be cooperative or non-cooperative. This includes tools for strategic reasoning that a) enhance reasoning ability to support intelligent individual decision-making in multi-player contexts, and b) that support composition of multi-player games to enable simulation-based analysis and reasoning. Interdisciplinary research that exploits and extends game theory for reasoning in dynamic strategic interactions involving many players in a hierarchy is of interest. Interactions may range from coalition-formation to bargaining to bidding and auction games. Strategic reasoning methods, applicable to a broad spectrum of strategic contexts, must address techniques to represent game models compactly, to ascertain best responses, and to predict game outcomes and dynamics. Developing tools for composing dynamic hierarchical games, including the development of a language for the specification and composition of games, is of interest. Proposals must be structured to address novel basic and core research in Phase I, with substantial extensions undertaken in later phases. Proposals should clearly specify the metrics and milestones for each phase. It is desired that in Phase I, proposals emphasize development of methods for compact representation of games, efficient algorithms for computing stable and predictable outcomes in games with large state spaces (target processing time and state space should be specified), and a framework and testbed for composing games for simulation and analysis. The emphases in Phases II and III will be on scaling strategic reasoning tools to game contexts of several hundred agents; incorporating probabilistic, temporal, and hybrid reasoners into individual or agent decision processes; developing rapid game composition capability and distributed play; and demonstrating the value of strategic reasoning in DOD contexts such as logistics and war-gaming.
 
Topic 3: Embedded reasoners for active knowledge bases

Research is sought in innovative methods for reasoners that can be embedded in knowledge bases with multiple ontologies to support efficient and well-informed reasoning. Functionally, embedded reasoners should enable the maximal exploitation of information present in the knowledge base for efficient query response. Of interest are methods that reason across multiple large ontologies, and dynamically recognize similarities, overlap, and divergence in the relations and structure of the different ontologies. Methods that rapidly and effectively join, combine, and merge large ontologies are of interest. The technical approaches to developing embedded reasoners should be clearly explained, and these may include, but are not limited to, graph matching and isomorphism algorithms.  Proposals should clearly specify the metrics and milestones, and testbed and demonstration plans, for each phase, capturing key dimensions of performance such as time to combine and merge ontologies of given sizes at a given processing speed. For example, a Phase I milestone may be to combine and merge two arbitrary ontologies, each having tens of thousands of entries, within seconds on a 1-GHz processor; and Phases II and III may focus on further scaling, as well combining ontologies with temporal, probabilistic, and other types of information. 

PROGRAM SCOPE  
  
Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art.  Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies listed above, and alternative visions will be considered.  However, proposals should be for research that substantially contributes towards the goals stated.  Research should result in prototype software and/or hardware demonstrating integrated concepts and approaches. In Phase II, DARPA may specify one or more common testbeds for the whole program, and performers are required to integrate and demonstrate their technology in such testbeds. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in minor evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice or focuses on special-purpose systems or narrow applications. Integrated solution sets embodying significant technological advances are strongly encouraged over narrowly defined research endeavors. Proposals may involve multiple research groups or industrial cooperation and cost sharing.

<ARCHDATE>11142003
<CONTACT>Paula Parker, 256-955-4344
<DESC>NA The U. S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) plans to solicit proposals for a competitively awarded follow-on contract to continue development and testing of Miniature Kill Vehicle (MKV) technology.  This technology is needed for future appli cation within the critically important Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  The government proposes to conduct this acquisition as a limited competition pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) & (iii). The proposed competition will be limit ed to the three contractor teams who are currently performing preliminary MKV concept development contracts.  These preliminary MKV development contracts were awarded through a full and open competition in Feb 2002 to teams headed by Science Applications I nternational Corporation (SAIC), Schafer Corporation, and Lockheed Martin Corporation.  The government believes that award to any other source than one of the three contractor teams currently performing the preliminary MKV development contracts would likel y result in substantial duplication of prior costs and lengthy delays in the development, testing and ultimate deployment of this critically important ballistic missile defense technology.  An Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract will be awarded to provide for the design, development, fabrication, and testing of prototype MKV systems.  In order to facilitate the earliest possible insertion of this technology into the Balli stic Missile Defense System, manufacturability, maintainability, producibility, affordability, and supportability considerations will be fully incorporated into designs generated under this effort.  The contractor selected is expected to deliver kill vehic les for hover testing before the end of 3rd quarter FY-05 that are of the same design and configuration as future flight test articles.  Redesign of the MKV after hover testing is not anticipated.  This procurement encompasses efforts required to define, d esign, develop, fabricate, integrate, test, and document kill vehicle and carrier vehicle components and to conduct integrated MKV system flight testing in the Pacific Test Bed.  Development activities will address components, subsystems, a fully integrate d MKV system, ground support equipment, interfaces with mission and launch control equipment, and interfaces with range support equipment as well as BMDS components.  The system level objectives are to demonstrate intercepts of multiple midcourse targets f rom one boost vehicle and successful integration with the BMDS.   Although the government intends to conduct a limited competition for this requirement as described herein, any contractors who believe they possess capabilities to perform the MKV system development may express their interest by submitting information that  details their capability to perform this requirement.  All responses, which are received within 15 days of this notification, will be considered.  The final determination as to whether this competition will be limited as described herein is within the sol e discretion of the Government.  Responses to this notification will be considered solely for the purpose of making a final determination on limited competition.  This acquisition is not open to Allied Participation.  This notification is not a Request for  Proposal and does not represent a commitment on the part of the Government to ultimately issue a Request for Proposal or award a contract.  The Government will not pay for any information provided in response to this announcement.

STATEMENT OF WORK ** International Mass Transportation Tenders List ** BACKGROUND:  While at anytime there are a vast number of transit projects being undertaken worldwide, U.S. companies that provide mass transportation related goods and services are often unaware of these opportunities.

An Internet accessible list of current mass transportation tenders would help inform U.S. companies about these opportunities. OBJECTIVES:  To inform U.S. producers of transit goods and services of export opportunities available abroad.  This helps support the international competitiveness of U.S. companies and supports the Department's and FTA's Strategic Goals of Economic Growth and Mobility.

WORK TASKS TO BE PERFORMED: Task 1.  Draft taxonomy:  The contractor shall produce a taxonomy for the structure of the final tenders list.  The taxonomy shall list the intended structure of how the tenders list will be organized in terms of types of goods and services.  The COTR will have one week to provide comments. Task 2.  Final taxonomy:  The contractor shall incorporate the COTR's comments on the draft taxonomy to develop the final taxonomy. Task 3.  Initial Research:  The contractor shall gather research on current and upcoming international tenders for public transportation related goods and services.  Information shall include the location, description of the tender, contact information for the tender, weblink for tender if available, and due date of tender. Task 4.  Draft tenders list:  The contractor shall develop a web-ready (HTML format or other format as approved by the COTR) tenders list of current international mass transportation tenders using the final taxonomy approved by the COTR and the research undertaken in Task 3.  The COTR will have two weeks to provide comments. Task 5.  Final tenders list:  The contract shall revise the draft tenders list incorporating comments by the COTR. Task 6.  Updating tenders list:  The contract shall update and submit a revised final tenders list on a biweekly-basis for one year. DELIVERABLES: This section describes each deliverables.

The CMc shall review all construction document submissions for contractibility and conform to the project budget.  The CMc shall review A-E cost estimates, shall provide independent cost estimates and recommend adjustments to the estimates or the design to assure that the project stays within budget.  The CMc shall provide GSA with sound management advice regarding the approach to the project, how to achieve the best value in the work being accomplished, necessary actions, schedule control, alternative ideas, problem/claim prevention, and budgeting.  The CMc shall have a full understanding of the project, its contract documents, the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration.  *******The range of this project is between $18,000,000.00 and $21,000,000.00.  Funds are currently NOT AVAILABLE for this project. ******* The objective of the Federal agencies would be to have the facility functioning and available to occupants at the time of the renovation and expansion project considering budgetary and time constrains. The CMc will be selected using Source Selection Procedures.  The contract will be a Fixed Price plus Incentive Award Contract.  The Advisory Multi-step and Source Selection procedures under FAR Part 15 will be employed as the method of selection.  Stage I Submissions: Firms having the capabilities to perform the services described in the RFP are invited to respond by submitting the required technical information as specified in the Stage I RFP. Stage II:  Firms determined to be viable competitors shall be asked to submit a Stage II proposal consisting of previously submitted information from Stage I, a detailed Project Management Plan, a price proposal, and participation in an Oral Presentation. Contract Award: Award of firm-fixed price contract will be based on the “best value trade-off” process (FAR 15). The “Best Value Trade-off Process” is a method of evaluation price and factors other than cost of price. This method of evaluation has the objective of making trade-offs among cost or price and non-cost or non-price factors, permitting award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror. The Government will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of both technical factors and price, as specified in the RFP. ******* Small Business. This solicitation is open to both large and small business concerns in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. Although this procurement is open to large business, small, small women-owned and minority businesses are strongly encouraged to participate. The Government recognizes the talent existing in smaller businesses and encourages their participation in the construction of Federal facilities. In accordance with Public Law 95-507, the offeror will be required to provide the maximum practicable opportunities for small business concerns, women-owned small business concerns and small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals to participate as subcontractors in the performance of the contract. In the event a large business (small businesses are not subject to this requirement) is the awardee, an acceptable subcontracting plan must be approved and accepted prior to contract award. Large businesses shall be required to demonstrate a proactive effort to have participation from small, small disadvantaged, small woman-owned, small HUBZone and small veteran-owned businesses. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 236220 for this project.

<DESC>THE GOOD NEWS:
For the first time in six years, the Smithsonian National Museum of American History has money to put toward redesigning its site (http://americanhistory.si.edu)

THE BAD NEWS:
We only have $50,000 of federal funds available at the moment (although there may be potential for more on a deferred payment basis).

THE FACTS:
We will issue the solicitation by password-protected URL access JULY 23, 2003 to all those who request this information. (Those vendors who responded to our earlier WishList posting on this site for project #501 will be receiving this access information and need not contact us again.)  Full capabilities statements/formal intent to bid will be due JULY 30, 2003 and we will hold a due diligence Q&A conference in Washington, DC on AUGUST 6, 2003.  (As stated above, proposals are due AUGUST 22, 2003 at NOON EST.)

We are looking for a capable vendor who will give us best value for a maximum initial commitment of $50K.  This could subsume the entirety of the redesign work (an effort for which we estimate a fair market value of $100-125,000, excluding CMS... see below) or some portion of it (presumably not less than $50,000 of fair market value, but possibly more), with Smithsonian options to conclude the work as additional funding becomes available.  NMAH doesn't get many opportunities to redesign its site and will not likely change things in the near future, so it is essential that we get this right the first time.

Smithsonian has acquired the Interwoven Teamsite content management system (CMS) and functionality within this CMS is an integral component of the redesign project.  HOWEVER! Please note that we plan to issue a separate, supplementary solicitation for the NMAH CMS development when SEPARATE funding for this work has been identified.  Offerors will therefore be invited to either propose Teamsite implementation of the redesign as an option or else express a willingness and methodology of working with a vendor who specializes in this CMS.

The development schedule for this project is somewhat flexible.  Requests for solicitations should be sent to FalkB@si.edu.

<DESC>USDA, ARS, SAA intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Telechem International, Inc/Arrayit  to do gene expression profiling using known pig genes as probes in order to produce 450 70-mer oligonucleotides printed on optically flat superaldehyde microarrays substrates. 150 microarrays will be printed immediately from oligos in storage at their facility with at least 300 printed at a later date as needed.  Specifications of this process are: USDA provides pig EST’s and tentative consensus sequences from a pig gene library, 450  70-mer oligos are to be designed from these sequences and must be specific for each gene. This directive ensures that the oligos are mapped to within 1000 nucleotides of the 3' end of the selected genes to eliminate poor hydridization due to inefficiencies in cDNA probe synthesis; designed oligos are selected to avoid sequence repeats and long stretches of polyA,G,C and T, also the melting temperatures of the oligos are matched within a selected range; and each oligo is checked against gene sequence databases to avoid cross-reactivity with transcript species of <70% sequence identity.  Oligos must be synthesized and printed in triplicate on optically flat glass. A control set of E.coli genes (10) will be included on the arrays to be used as negative or positive controls. Aliquots of poly A RNA corresponding to these genes must be provided. The company must have the facilities and capability to store for a period of up to 2 years and facilitate microarray manufacturing as needed.  Interested parties should submit written responses including prices and technical data sufficient to determine capability to meet the entire requirement and must be received in this office within 15 calendar days after publication of this notice. No telephone inquiries will be accepted. It should be noted that no contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a comparable source more advantageous to the Government is available.  If no affirmative written responses are received, negotiations will be held with TeleChem Internation, Inc/Arrayit without further notice.  This acquisition is being conducted under the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The anticipated award date is July 14, 2003.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA The Army Contracting Agency, Dugway Proving Ground, Utah is requesting proposals for Field Range Testing & Laboratory Support Services to be performed at the West Desert Test Center (WDTC). The WDTC plans, conducts, evaluates, and reports on developmental,  operational tests, and operational training scenarios, to assess the military value of chemical and biological (CB) defense systems, incendiary and smoke/obscuration munitions systems, and related operational concepts. The WDTC also plans, conducts, evalu ates, and reports on non-CB testing for the Department of Defense (DoD) and other federal agencies (e.g., environmental assessment/impact evaluations, weapons and munitions demilitarization, hazard assessments, and technical / logistical support of Air For ce operations at DPG). DPG participates in development of technology and methodology to support assigned testing. Test programs include evaluation of munitions, CB detection and protection devices, testing to determine nuclear / biological / chemical (NBC)  contamination / decontamination survivability of various DoD materiel and equipment, and a wide range of developmental testing and applied research related to tactics, techniques, and procedures. Test procedures involve artillery and mortar fire, aerial s pray trials, physical and environmental stress testing, human factors engineering, virtual reality methodology/implementation, accelerated climatic storage, contamination / decontamination evaluations, and performance and reliability testing of items in th e field or within enclosed chambers. Chemical and biological laboratory support is required to conduct these tests. Such activities include growth and purification of simulants and organisms (including Biolab Safety level 3 operation). Simulant agent mater ials are frequently disseminated to challenge detection and protection equipment and to evaluate concepts of deployment of detection and protection equipment. Chemical analytical activities are performed to support test and compliance programs to satisfy A rmy, State, and Federal Government regulations on safety, surety, hazardous waste, and the environment. The WDTC is currently certified under the ISO 9000 international standard. Management has adopted the policy of providing equipment and services that ha ve requisite quality to guarantee customer satisfaction throughout the test cycle. The ISO 9000 certif ication is essential in adding creditability to the policy. To achieve this objective, it is the policy of WDTC to establish and maintain an ef ficient a nd effective quality system, planned and developed in conjunction with all management functions.

The Contractor shall be required to set up samplers, test fixtures, photo instrumentation, radio communica tion, software support, and range control for various field and chamber test sites in support of other types of tests. All generated waste shall be handled in accordance with (IAW) applicable regulations and local procedures. Specific task assignments shal l be issued by the Government to implement the general requirements of this contract. Each task assignment will define the specific type of field, chamber, virtual reality methodology/implementation, laboratory, test support, analytical, compliance , and p rotocol functions to be performed. Each specific task assignment will contain sufficient background information (e.g., specifications, drawings, work breakdown structures, milestone schedules, earned value management (EVM) requirements IAW DoD Manu al 5000 .2 (refer to Attachment D of DoD Manual 5000.2 for EVM requirements), quality assurance and inspection standards, and other appropriate descriptive material) for the Contractor to determine the scope of work and the performance criteria used for completing  the work satisfactorily.

<DESC>Description:  Questions Received and Answers provided concerning this procurement.
1.	Is there an incumbent? There is no incumbent.

2.	The NAICS size standard is $6.0M, does it mean that the bidder is under $6.0M size standard only?  Is this a full and open competition?  Would any consideration be given to making this a Small Business Set-Aside?  Perhaps a couple of small companies teaming together?  This procurement is unrestricted and the NAICS was included for informational purposes.

3.	What is the Government estimate?   What budget has been in place in the past for these services?   There has been no specific budget for these services.  The original estimate was well under $100,000.  As a result of revising the requirement to add an additional performance period of 30 days the estimate is still under $100,000.  A new Optional CLIN 0004 for an implementation process plan and assistance, is being added by Amendment, however, funds are not now available for this effort and exercise of Option CLIN 0004 is subject to funds becoming available.  If Option CLIN 0004 is exercised, performance would be after the initial 90 day performance period for CLINS 0001 through 0003.  Option CLIN 0004 is not included in the Government Estimate.  Travel will become CLIN 0005 with a not to exceed price ceiling of $10,000.  Two trips to DCMA HQ are anticipated and all travel during performance will be approved in advance and reimbursed in accordance with the Joint Travel Regulation.

4.	Given that the CLIN 0002 deliverable’s depth and breadth is dependent upon CLIN 0001 results, is there an alternative timeframe for submitting the CLIN 0002 deliverable?  If so, what is the timeframe?  Why is the period of performance limited to 60 days, we estimate it would take at least six months to complete with a high level of quality and thoroughness.   DCMA will revise the performance period to make CLIN 0001 deliverable and mid performance review due 45 calendar days after contract award and CLIN 0002 and 0003 to be due 90 calendar days after contract award.  Option CLIN 0004 performance period will be determined by the successful offeror’s proposal and whether funds become available for its exercise.

5.	Is a more detailed solicitation available? Is there an official RFP?  Is there a full Statement of Work available for Solicitation Number: DCMA01-03-Q-0003, Customer Relations Management Overview?  Or is the solicitation posted on FedBizzOpps the complete Statement of Work?  The combined synopsis solicitation is the official RFP.  The combined synopsis and solicitation as well as any amendments posted on www.eps.gov constitute the complete solicitation.  The combined synopsis solicitation is the only document available.  

6.	When will a list of interested vendors be available?  There is no plan to publish such a list.  

7.	May we submit a proposal for a portion of the SOW? Is DCMA willing to split the RFQ and award individual CLINS?  Offers are requested for the full requirement as it is anticipated that only one purchase order or delivery order will be issued for the entire requirement.

8.	Does DCMA anticipate using a contractor to expand on the results of this initial work and support the implementation of CRM?  Option CLIN 0004 has been added for implementation support should funds become available.  No other procurements are anticipated.

9.	Does DCMA anticipate developing a software solution for CRM?  Unknown at this time as industry proposals may or may not recommend use of a software tool.  Cost of any software tool referred to in offerors proposals should be  priced in the offer with supporting cost documentation. 

10.	Travel:  Customer Base Paragraph IV represents DCMA customers worldwide, but no mention is made regarding travel to customer sites.  Should travel plans be included as part of a response, and if not, what arrangements will DCMA make to provide information on the customer base?  The solicitation, Paragraph IX, indicates that the services will be performed at the contractor’s facility with visits to DCMA HQ.  However, directions for preparing the price proposal asks for all anticipated travel, destinations, purpose of travel and associated costs.  Could you clarify the extent to which you anticipate travel requirements outside the D.C. Metropolitan area?  If you can, specify the key field offices locally and overseas to price travel more or less correctly.  How many sites does the contractor need to visit?   Travel is CLIN 0005 with a not to exceed price ceiling of $10,000.  Two trips to DCMA HQ are anticipated and all travel during performance will be approved in advance and reimbursed in accordance with the Joint Travel Regulation.  No overseas travel is anticipated.  Proposals may indicate any other travel the offeror feels would be germane to this effort. The Customer Base was described in Paragraph VI. 

11.	How do I send my proposal by email, fax, or mail, Fedex?  Proposals should not be submitted by email.  Use regular mail or Fedex or any other means in order to deliver an original signature by paper as required by clause FAR 52.212-1.  In addition to the paper submission, provide the MS PowerPoint technical presentation by CD or diskette in your proposal submission.  Proposals must be received by the specified time, currently May 2 at 4:00 p.m. local time.

12.	Based on our prior experience in conducting similar initiatives, 60 days represents an extremely aggressive schedule for completion of the stipulated level of assessment and analysis tasks. Are there other constraints or requirements that impact the stated performance period? In that regard, can you confirm that the period of performance is 60 calendar days rather than 60 working days?  The revised period of performance for CLINS 0001 through 0003 is 90 calendar days.  Known constraints are funding levels available for this effort and internal milestones for completing the project. 

13.	Proposal preparation instructions indicate that proposed prices and Key Personnel resumes may be provided as separate documents. Also, the proposal preparation instructions call for the inclusion of Corporate Past Performance information. Can you confirm that the Key Personnel resumes are not included in the 25 slide limitation?  Secondly, can you confirm that the Corporate Past Performance information should be included as a separate document and is not to be included in the 25 slide limitation? Are all associated representations and certifications considered to be separate and excluded from the 25 slide limitation?   Key Personnel resumes, pricing information, Corporate Past Performance and contractor certifications and representations are requested to be provided separately from the 25 page slide presentation.  The 25 page limit includes the cover page.   Offerors may, however, include any information they wish in the 25 page slide presentation.  Refer to the original synopsis solicitation for evaluation criteria for the 25 page slide presentation as well as the other parts of the offer.

14.	The solicitation requires that one outcome include a "fully integrated DCMA marketing program spanning the customer base". The term "marketing program" could be interpreted in several ways. Can you provide an explanation of what a "marketing program" might be considered to include? Is there an existing plan and would this document be available? What is the definition and expectation for the integrated marketing plan?  There is too little direction in the RFQ to feel we know what the focus is and as stated, it pretty much covers the waterfront.   DCMA wants to be able to convey to its customers our capabilities and have the customers understand who we are and what we offer.  The intended outcome is to improve customer relations and customer satisfaction.  There is no existing marketing plan.

15.	Does the scope of this work include the International District and from DCMA's perspective are there any unique considerations that should be applied to an international scope?  DCMA seeks industry expertise on the full scope of DCMA effort including International.

16.	Would performance create an Organizational Conflict of Interest for the successful offeror for future CRM work beyond this contract?  We are mitigating any organizational conflict of interest by adding Optional CLIN 0004.  DCMA expects offers from industry leaders who should be able to submit and price a proposed implementation process plan.  DCMA does not anticipate any future procurement for this requirement beyond the current RFQ.

17.	Do we need to get on a bidders list or can we just submit a proposal by the due date?  If there are any amendments to the RFQ, can you please send them to me? There is no bidders list as all notices including amendments will be posted on www.eps.gov

18.	Evaluation factors in Power Point format as well as two paper copies will be limited to 25 pages?  Please clarify.  Evaluation factors are the criteria that will be used to evaluate offers.  Your technical proposal should be limited to 25 MS PowerPoint slide presentation.

19.	Is the contract term only 60 days?  If so, what follow up plans are in place to ensure success of the installation?  Would there be an opportunity for follow on activity?  The performance period is revised as discussed above.  Optional CLIN 0004 has been added to provide an opportunity to propose an implementation plan and assistance.  Funds are not currently available and CLIN 0004 will only be exercised should funding be made available. There are no plans for any follow on procurement.

20.	Will the transformation of the DCMA's management and operating procedures, policies and processes be complete by the time that the Customer Relations Management Overview (CRMO) is initiated?  Unknown but expected to be ongoing through out the period of performance.

21.	How will the CRMO be managed afterwards?  Agency CRM efforts will be ongoing.

22.	We understand all of the following 5 deliverable are to be provided within 60 days of contract award. Is that correct?  (1)  An assessment of the adequacy of DCMA's customer outreach and customer satisfaction measurement practices (2) A comparison of DCMA's current customer relationship practices with best practices (3) The process(es) for collecting, storing and using customer information at 3 DCMA org levels  (4) The process for measuring and managing DCMA's performance against known customer expectations (5) A fully integrated marketing program.  If yes, is the expectation, then, that DCMA would receive an off-the shelf (canned) response for deliverable #5?  The required performance outcomes are stated in Paragraph VI, however, the performance period has been extended to 90 calendar days discussed above.  Offerors should propose their best solution.  See discussion above for Optional CLIN 0004.

29.	Most of the deliverables requested are primarily concerned with the capture of customer expectations and measurement of satisfaction. The integrated marketing program should properly be developed only upon completion of the first deliverables unless it is DCMA's desire to develop a marketing program independent of known customer priorities. Does DCMA want the marketing program to capitalize on customer insights gained through creation of the first deliverables?  If the answer is "yes", then we assume a solution that is customized to the specific business, mission and organizational structure of DCMA is desired. Will DCMA allow for the timetable to be extended to enable that to occur?   DCMA requests proposals to meet stated requirements at the offerors discretion.   DCMA has extended the performance period to 45 calendar days for CLINS 0001 and mid performance review and extended the performance period for CLINS 0002 and 0003 to 90 calendar days from date of award and has added optional CLIN 0004.  

30.	Is the deliverable for processes for collecting, storing and using customer information at 3 DCMA org levels to include a CRM system design or is this merely an option we may, but are not required to, propose?  DCMA is looking for an effective CRM process to be developed for the Agency.  Offerors should propose accordingly.

31.	Has DCMA created any documentation (e.g., As-Is process maps, narrative descriptions of processes, etc.) to define its existing customer outreach and satisfaction measurement-related processes?  If so, will the supporting offeror have access to such documentation?  DCMA has process materials which will be made available at contract award.

32.	Has DCMA performed any benchmarking on the above-referenced processes?  If so, will the supporting offeror have access to such documentation?  DCMA has done no benchmarking.

33.	The DCMA RFQ notes that key personnel resumes and proposed prices can be provided as separate documents.  Can these documents be prepared in MS Word, or should they be prepared in PowerPoint?  MS Word is acceptable in addition to two paper copies of the offer.

34.	The RFQ refers to “near and longer term.”  How does DCMA define near term?  Longer term?  For example, is near term 1 year or less?  Is longer term over 1 year?  Near term is under 12 months and longer term is greater than 12 months. 

35.	For the required benchmarking, DCMA wants “…progressive public and private sector,    service-based organizations.”  Has DCMA identified how many organizations, by type (e.g., public sector), should be benchmarked?  No, DCMA expects offerors to make recommendations in this regard.

36.	Given the nature of the project, will the potential offeror have access to customers (e.g., Program Managers) to conduct interviews or data gathering workshops?  It is anticipated that DCMA will make available after contract award, results of prior customer surveys.

37.	The RFQ provides information on the proposal due date, number of copies for submission and the location for submission.  Upon arriving at the location, should proposal packages be left at the front desk or a designated individual?  There is a guard at the entry to the building who will call the Contract Specialist or Contracting Officer to pickup the package.  Please allow sufficient time for mailing or delivery of your proposal.

38.	44. We are very interested in submitting a proposal in regards to this solicitation.  In preparation for this proposal, would it be possible for directors from our company to visit one of the Contract Management Offices (CMOs) during the next week? Is there a CMO near Boston, London and/or Paris?  If a visit is possible, what steps are  required ahead of time?   Pre-proposal site visits are not being made available to offerors.

39.	This solicitation does not make any reference to "training".   Shall we assume that this key piece should be included in the proposal for this solicitation, or will there be another solicitation specifically focusing on the training aspect?  No other procurements in conjunction with this requirement are anticipated.  Any required or proposed training should be included and priced in your proposal perhaps in Optional CLIN 0004 Implementation Process Plan and Assistance.

The main organization currently  housed in this facility is the military personnel office.   Since this office will remain in operation during  construction, minimizing the impact to this mission will be  a critical concern.  The extremely high level of visibility  of this project will result in an unusually high level of  scrutiny by all levels of WPAFB leadership.  The building  currently occupied by the civilian personnel office is  scheduled for demolition.  This major renovation will  involve the complex management of numerous disciplines  (inlcuding the installation of sytems furniture), working  simultaneously, and critical phasing and scheduling  requirements.  The contractor must have extensive  experience in the management of large multi-disciplined  projects in order to successfully complete this effort.   Failure to supervise and coordinate the different trades  required to provide a quality and timely product will not  be acceptable as it would result in the disruption of the  long range plans for the using organization.  This would  trigger a "domino effect" which will negatively impact the  long range plans of several other organizations.

<ARCHDATE>09192003
<CONTACT>Gregory Davies, 410-278-6809
<DESC>NA The Army Research Laboratory, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD is plans to buy a 100 Ton Vacuum Hot Press System (quantity of one (1) each plus supporting accessories). The contract will be firm-fixed price. The anticipated award date is August 2003.  This acti on is a 100% Small Business Set Aside. The NAICS code for this action is 333994 and the SIC code is 3559, both have a Small Business size standard of 500 employees. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with t he format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This action is issued as a reques t for proposal (RFP).  The solicitation number is DAAD17-03-R-0031. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2001-14. This purchase will be made under the test procedur es for the procurement of commercial items under the authority of FAR 13.5. ARLs statement of requirements/objectives for the hot press system are as follows: Boron carbide research at the Army Research Laboratory is focused on improving solid plates used as ballistic protection in personnel armor systems such as Interceptor.  The research involves introducing additives, such as sintering aids or carbon nanotube s, to boron carbide powder, consolidating the mixture, and evaluating the effect of the additives on the microstructure and properties of the part.  Property evaluation can include ballistic evaluation of solid tiles in a depth-of-penetration test.  Evalua tion of the results of depth-of-penetration requires comparison to tiles of similar size.  Available depth-of-penetration data for boron carbide includes results from tests on round tiles of 4 inch diameter, and square tiles with a 6 inch side. Boron carbi de is consolidated in a hot press, a device that allows simultaneous application of high temperature and pressure to the powder compact.  Temperatures used in the successful consolidation of boron carbide are typically greater than 2000 degrees C, and some times as high as 2500 degrees C.  This has required the use of graphite tooling for the hydraulic press and, consequently, the establishment of an argon atmosphere.  Establishment of an argon atmosphere requires that the furnace be evacuated. The vacuum hot press system should have the following capabilities: Consolidation of a 6 inch diameter (and 6 inch square) x 1 inch thick compact of boron carbide at 2300 degrees C. Operating temperature shall be 2300 degrees C, with a maximum temperature of 2500 degrees C.  Hot Pressing Capability shall be 100 tons total force, with +/-550 pounds control resolution from 200,000 to 20,000 pounds total force. Usable work zone shall be 12 in. wide x 12 in. high x 12 in. deep. Working Vacuum level shall be 10-2 Torr. Process Gases shall be argon or nitrogen, up to 2 psig max. Controls shall include a programmable process controller for the furnace and the hydraulic system. The technical POC for this requirement is: Dr. Robert H. Woodman, AMSRL-WM-MD, B-4600, APG, MD, Tel: 410-306-0013, Fax: 410-306-0806, Email: rwoodman@arl.army.mil The acceptance and FOB point is Destination.  Delivery shall be made to U.S. Army Research Laboratory, ATTN: AMSRL-WMBD, Bldg. 434, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005-5001.  Final acceptance of this system will be made only after unit is assembled, tested, and found compliant by the Government end user.  The contracting officer supports payment under resultant contract to be by milestone (or performance-based) payment plan.  Offerors are encouraged to forward their proposed milestone payment plan with their submittal.  Evaluation Criteria:  Timely proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation Commercial Items.  The Government will award a  contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Contracting Officer shall make a best value award decision bas ed on the following evaluation factors: Technical approach of the item offered to meet the Governments requirements; Price; Past Performance, and Delivery Schedule, in descending order of importance. Technical approach and past performance, when combined, are more important, when compared to pri ce. Delivery schedules are important to the Government and will be evaluated separately, but will be given a lower importance than price. The Government will award a contract to the offeror whose offer conforms to the statement of objectives outlined herei n and will result in a contract most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The contracting officer may make award to other than the lowest priced offeror.  The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions . The technical evaluation will be a determination of the offerors ability to deliver a complete Hot Press system that meets the stated specifications and shall be based on information furnished by the offeror. The government is not responsible for locatin g or securing any information that is not identified in the proposal. To ensure sufficient information is available, vendors must furnish as part of their proposal all descriptive material necessary for the Government to determine whether the product(s) me ets technical requirements. Past performance will be evaluated based on information provided by the offeror as to actual sales of the similar products to industry or government agencies (contractor format for past performance data is desired). Past perform ance will consider the reviews/ratings of other users who presently use or used offerors products and ability of the offeror to meet delivery schedules. Offerors must include records of at least three recent sales, within the last 5 years, and identify a p oint of contact for each by providing a name and telephone number.  Failure to submit past performance information (or to address past performance) with your proposal will result in your proposal being non-responsive.   The clause at FAR 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside (JUL 1996) applies to this acquisition.  Offerors shall include a completed and signed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items  (APR 2001) and FAR 52.219-1, Alt I, Small Business Program Representations, with its offer.

The CMOs and subordinate offices are located in, or close by, defense contractors performing work for the Department of Defense and multiple civilian agencies.

	Background:  At present, DCMA is transforming its management and operating policies, processes and procedures to better align Agency performance with the needs and priorities of customer organizations in support of the warfighter.  DCMA’s success in a performance-based operating mode will be driven not by multiple, internally developed performance metrics, but by the success of the Agency and its primary operating elements, the CMOs, in both understanding individual customer needs and priorities, and delivering services and products that are keyed to those needs and priorities.  The CMOs, as direct service providers, will require a means of managing or gauging their performance against customer stated priorities.  The HQ and District organizations will also require a less discrete, more global means of gauging the quality and effectiveness of customer support activities at the CMO level.

	Existing DCMA/customer relationship building, outreach (marketing) and customer satisfaction assessment vehicles and activities can be grouped into five different categories:  

1)	Senior level customer visits by HQ and District personnel (OSD Senior Executives, Service Acquisition Executives (SAEs), Program Executive Officers (PEOs), Buying Activity Senior Leaders
2)	Monthly telephone surveys of key customer personnel such as Program Managers (PMs), Procuring Contracting Officers (PCOs), and Inventory Managers conducted by District personnel
3)	A Web-Based customer satisfaction and feedback tool
4)	Customer Liaison Representatives (CLRs) co-located with major DCMA customers 
5)	Visits to senior customer representatives by CMO Commanders and senior staff members.  

Each of these five categories of customer relationship building and customer outreach activities provides customer information and insights, but the shift to performance-based management operating principles will require a more sophisticated, integrated, informative and real-time feedback methodology to help all levels of the organization both understand customer expectations, and gauge the adequacy of DCMA performance in response to expressed customer expectations.  A new and enhanced customer relationship management system is needed that will provide a clear understanding of near term, as well as emerging, customer priorities and expectations.

Required Performance Outcomes:

(1)	Review and assess the adequacy of DCMA’s existing customer outreach and customer satisfaction measurement activities and processes.  This includes:  

1)	The processes and procedures designed to assist DCMA in understanding and responding to customer needs, both near and longer term
2)	The process, tools and metrics used to assess customer satisfaction
3)	Processes that encompass marketing the variety of DCMA products and services to ensure sufficient customer knowledge of DCMA capabilities

(2)	Contrast DCMA’s customer relationship management practices and procedures previously described with progressive public and private sector, service-based organizations.  Identify gaps between the DCMA activities and processes, and those employed by progressive public and private sector organizations.

(3)	Based upon the two foregoing reviews, and a review of existing literature on customer relationship management policies and practices, develop an integrated customer relations process that will provide DCMA:  

1)	A more useful and integrated customer knowledge base, and the necessary processes and procedures for accumulating, storing and utilizing customer information at each of the three DCMA organizational levels
2)	A process for managing and gauging the level of DCMA performance against expressed customer expectations and desired outcomes within a performance-based organization.  (The process and customer satisfaction gauge must be useful and appropriate at each of the three DCMA organizational levels, CMO level with buying activity Program Managers, PCOs, Inventory Managers, et al, and District and HQ organizational elements with successively higher level customer organizations and senior personnel (OSD Senior Executives, Service Acquisition Executives, PEOs, and Buying Activity Senior Leaders, et al.)
3)	A fully integrated DCMA marketing program spanning the customer base
