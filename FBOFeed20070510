<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue a sole source contract to VT Halter Marine, 900 Bayou Casotte Parkway, Pascagoula, MS, 39581, to procure a T-AGS Oceanographic Survey Ship (T-AGS 66).  T-AGS 66 is planned to be a modified repeat design of the current T-AGS 65 ship.  VT Halter Marine retains the proprietary rights to the design data and possesses the technical skills, logistic expertise, and production facilities to design and construct this ship and is therefore the only source capable of meeting this requirement.  Prior to the ship construction award, NAVSEA intends to negotiate with VT Halter Marine to conduct limited functional design studies.  VT Halter Marine will investigate modifying their existing design to accommodate a center well, new handling systems for ROV and additional accommodations.  The T-AGS 66 will become the eighth ship in the Navy’s oceanographic ship fleet.  See Numbered Note 22.*****

<CONTACT>Lonnie Oswalt 850-234-4239 or Contracting Officer Mark Ross at 850-235-5624.
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a Request for Quotation (RFQ); the solicitation number is N61331-07-. The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to award on a Sole Source basis a firm-fixed price contract to SWE-DISH Satellite Systems, Inc., 12343 Sunrise Valley Drive, Suite D, Reston, VA 20191-3417.  This procurement will be issued using the Authority of the Test Program for Commercial Items, Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996.  The Deployable Joint Command and Control (DJC2) program has the need to procure satellite communications capability for incorporation into the Rapid Response Kit (RRK) of the DJC2 systems.  SWE-Dish Satellite Systems, !  Inc. is the sole provider of the AN/USC-68 satellite terminal currently used in the DJC2 system.  The IPT-i MIL Suitcase satellite system is nearly identical to the AN/USC-68, the only difference is the internal modem.  Training, operation, and replacement parts are nearly identical for the two systems.  This commonality and compatibility with existing DJC2 equipment will decrease the training requirements for RRK and will eliminate the need for a completely separate logistics tail for the RRK.  Source control drawings, training materials and other support products have already been developed at the government’s expense for the AN/USC-68 and the majority of these products will be able to be re-used for the IPT-i MIL satellite system.  Operators who have been trained on the AN/USC-68 will not need to be re-trained in order to operate the IPT-i MIL satellite system.  The DJC2 program has already made a considerable investment in the AN/USC-68.  Each DJC2 system is delivered w!  ith two AN/USC-68 systems.  Procurement of any system other than the I PT-i MIL for the RRK (which is a subset of DJC2) will result in significant additional cost to the government because training material will have to be written and validated, unique set-up and operations procedures will need to be written, validated and incorporated in DJC2 technical manuals and the DJC2 System Support team would require additional military manning if another unique communications system  is added to the DJC2 system. The following is being procured: CLIN 0001:  Eight(8) each SWE-DISH IPT-i MIL Satellite Systems CLIN 0002:  Eight(8) each SWE-DISH IPT-i MIL Satellite Systems CLIN 0003:  Eight(8) each SWE-DISH IPT-i MIL Satellite Systems CLIN 0004:  One(1)   each SWE-DISH IPT-MIL Suitcase, p/n AN-USC-68 NAICS CODE IS 334220.  Small Business Size Standard is 750 employees.  FSC is 5820.  The items will be delivered to the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Ave, Panama City Beach, FL 32407-7018.  This solicitation document and incorporated clauses and provisions are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-08, effective 5 January 2006.  INSTRUCTIONS:  The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items applies to this acquisition.

The original contract award, contract N68936-07-D-0004, was made on 9 November 2006 in the amount of $1,170,885.00.  For the current modification, the government requires updated configuration BDAC cards to support the F/A-18-EA-18G Advanced Weapons lab and the F/A-18 Fleet. These cards are part of the on-board video recording system of the F/A-18 and are used to store configuration files that the recorder uses for set up and system operation. The Naval Air Systems Command, Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAVAIR WD) requires these BDAC cards to be used to rapidly change configurations of the on-board video recording systems.  The older version cards that were originally delivered to support the recorders are obsolete.  Updated configuration cards are needed to support expanded testing and to support the F/A-18-EA-18G fleet assets. These additional BDAC cards and embedded software will use the existing data processing and handling infrastructure already in place at China Lake. This software is only available through TEAC Aerospace Technologies, Inc. Monterey Park, CA.  The minimum number of BDAC Cards is 130; the maximum is 300.  Delivery of this contract line item number (CLIN) will be FOB destination to the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division China Lake, CA 60 days after receipt of order.  Any firms believing that they can provide the above listed card, clearly showing their ability to do so without compromising the quality, accuracy, and reliability of the data, while achieving the compatibility issues stated above, may submit a written response to be received at the contracting office no later than 20 May 07. Award will be issued under the authority of the test program for commercial items (FAR 13.5). All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. Award of this contract modification is expected to be on or about 25 May 07. All requests must reference Contract Number N68936-07-D-0004. Please submit responses in writing to Gary Trimble by email at gary.trimble@navy.mil or by mail to Commander Code 210000D, NAVAIR WD, 429 E. Bowen Rd Stop 4015, China Lake CA 93555-6108.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Executive Office for United States of Attorney?s (EOUSA) District of Arizona invites contractors to submit a proposal for services described in the attached statement of work, under the authority of Part 12 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

Enclosed you will find a Statement of Work for Nurse Consultation Services in the office of Phoenix and Tucson.  Please submit your price and technical proposal by 4:30 pm (EST) on March 12, 2007.

The selection process will consist of a Best Value source selection based on key personnel, organizational past performance, organizational experience, and price.  Under a Best Value source selection, non-price evaluation factors, when combined are significantly more important than price.  However, EOUSA will not select an offeror for award on the basis of a superior capability without consideration of the amount of its price. Contractors may submit proposals for both locations (Phoenix and Tucson) or for one of the locations.  EOUSA intends to award up to two contracts under this solicitation. The Contractor must provide the following information:

(1) Provide resumes of prospective personnel. The personnel will be the person expected to perform the tasks identified in the Scope of Work. The resume should reflect the personnel?s security clearance level, training and certifications, if any.

(2) Provide up to three (3) references for commensurate projects that are in progress or were completed within the last three (3) years.  If a Contractor will be using a subcontractor, up to three (3) references must be provided for the subcontractor as well.  References may be from commercial and federal/state Government contracts; however, similar support services performed for Federal Government customers generally will be considered more relevant than those done for commercial or state government customers.  The Government reserves the right to check other references not provided by the Contractor.  The following information is required for each reference:
		
		(A)  Customer name and address
		(B)  Point of contact (name, telephone number) for contractual/administrative matters and technical performance.
		(C)  Period of contract performance
		(D)  Description of work performed

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate intends to award a sole source contract to Noninvasive Medical Technologies Inc., 6412 S. Arville St., Las Vegas NV, 89118, for the development and testing of an electronic, net-centric casualty tag system for use by Special Operations Forces (SOF).  These tags and their associated devices must be able to assist the on-scene care giver or rescue personnel in conducting basic triage of multiple casualties in a combat situation.  The system is envisioned as multiple smart tags that when activated by a casualty or an aid giver, can measure, store and communicate in real-time basic measures of casualty status to other (one or more) devices carried by medical or recovery personnel.  This status information must include, as a minimum, measurements of heart rate, respiratory rate, and cardiac output, which must be ascertained real-time, and employ an automated casualty severity status prioritization methodology for situations when multiple tags have been activated, so that the system supports decision-making by personnel with a range of medical experience, from basic to advanced.  The tags must be able to generate their health status information in an entirely non-invasive manner and must not require direct skin contact with the monitored individual by any component of the system and must still be able to perform all functions through typical battlefield clothing.  The part of the system carried by medical or recovery personnel must also be able to provide location cues that, combined with the casualty status information, can help them prioritize and find casualties on the battlefield even when obscured by terrain, vegetation or other visual barriers.  This system component must be able to store received information and be compatible with communications systems carried by the SOF over which it can relay the stored information.  In particular, the device must be compatible with the Special Operations Forces Tactical Network (SOFTNet).  Since medical information will be transmitted over communications channels, the Air Force also requires that the system comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  The Air force also requires that the tags be usable as a status reporting system for non-wounded team members.  In this capacity, the tags need the ability to adapt to individual?s physiological base lines and based on these baselines, transmit the wearer?s current status information to the collection system to support improved team tactical resource management.  

The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Interested parties may submit statements of capability (SOC).  Submit SOCs within 45 days of publication to Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/MNK), Attn: Donna Moran, 101 W. Eglin Blvd, Suite 337, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6810.     Please refer technical questions to Eric Werkowitz at (850) 882-8541 and contractual questions to Donna Moran at (850) 883-2676.     An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the contracting points of contact identified above.  The Ombudsman is Sue Hunter; her phone number is (937) 904-9700.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT

     Under the authority of 41 U.S.C 253(c)(1), it is the Government's intent to award a sole-source, firm fixed-price contract to Nimblegen Systems, Inc.  Nimblegen, a small business for NAICS 541710, is located at 1 Science Ct., Madison, WI  53711-1055, USA.  The contract will include a one year base period and two one year option periods.
     Nimblegen will produce 67 customized bovine microarrays with 340000 features of 60mer oligos and provide continual changing of the oligo sequence and 80 CGH Custom Full Service Bovine CGH's.  Samples will be shipped once every two months.  Nimblegen will provide expression data values, along with raw data, design files and supplementary data files 30 days after the samples are submitted.  This work is building on previous collaborations and an award to a source other than Nimblegen will likely result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government which is not expected to be recovered through competition.
     This notice of intent to award a sole source contract is not a request for competitive proposals.  Firms wishing to challenge the sole-source decision must submit a letter of interest, referencing REQ07-103795, to the named point of contact demonstrating the firm's ability to provide the service as described above.  Firms shall also indicate whether or not they are a small business, small women-owned business, small disadvantaged business and/or an 8(a) small business concern.  Send detailed capabilities to the following email address no later than 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, 25 May 2007.  EMAIL:  andrew.sullivan@ars.usda.gov.

DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>JECP Family of Systems are intended to collectively protect Joint expeditionary forces against chemical, biological, radiological (CBR) / toxic industrial material (TIM) contaminated environments. JECP tent kits and structure kits are intended to pro vide a versatile, transportable capability to convert common structures and tentage into a collective protection (ColPro) system.  JECP standalone shelter systems are intended to be self-contained (i.e., shall not require other supporting systems or compon ents such as tentage, building, structure or vehicle, etc.) and available in multiple sizes/configurations to meet various mission requirements.   JECP systems will be adapted in remote locations and harsh environments where sustainment/support is challeng ing, and fixed-site ColPro is limited or non-existent.  JECP systems will allow personnel to continue to perform command and control, medical, and rest and relief missions at near normal operations tempo without being encumbered by individual CBR protectiv e equipment.  JECP systems will integrate with existing electrical power and heating-cooling where available and support common functions associated with operational missions, such as sanitation, eating-drinking, floor-space, entry/exit, contamination cont rol, etc.  JECP systems will provide flexibility by reducing the need to deploy, move, and maintain large, heavy and complex ColPro systems.

<DESC>The agency is voluntarily taking corrective action to rectify a situation that has impacted a single proposal from Microtech, LLC of Vienna, VA in a single functional area, FA2, during evaluations for the VETS GWAC.  Making this award is the appropriate step to ensure and promote acquisition integrity.  This corrective action was identified during a recent systematic overall review of the evaluation by the agency, and the correction is unique/does not apply to other proposals since it wasn't found in any other instance. The resulting impact is that Microtech's FA2 offer has been deemed to be in the award pool of the most highly qualified offerors, above the natural break that differentiated awardees from non-awardees.  As a result, this decision does not alter the known evaluation decision results or relationships that distinguished between awardees and non-awardees, it simply places one additional firm in the ranks of the awardees. GSA is pleased to welcome Microtech to the VETS GWAC in FA 2.   Contract number is GS-06F-0551Z.

<DESC>FA8620-07-C-4020 Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP) 1C/2C:  This is a pre-solicitation synopsis. The Aeronautical Systems Center , 659  Aeronautical Systems Squadron intends to award a contract on a sole source  basis to Northrop Grumman Space and Mission Systems Corp. for the rapid  development, integration and testing of a fieldable, scaled, communication  intelligence system based on the ASIP architecture for the MQ-1, MQ-1X,  MQ-9 and RQ-4B (Block 30 I) Unmanned Aerial Systems.  The sensor portion  of the system will collect and process selected signals that are  classified up to and including Top Secret/SCI.  Specific requirements are  listed in Section 3 of the ASIP 1C/2C Systems Requirement Document that is  classified Secret/SI (available for review at Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio).  The Air Force Distributed Common Ground System will command and control  the ASIP 1C/2C sensors using interface standards established on the  baseline ASIP program. Northrop Grumman Space and Mission Systems Corp. is the sole designer,  developer, and manufacturer of the ASIP family of sensors and is the only  firm that possesses the necessary knowledge, experience and technical data  required to build these sensors in a timely and cost effective manner.  The anticipated design is a scaled version of the existing ASIP sensor and  requires minimal dollars and time to develop.  Planned spiral upgrade and  logistical support funding is insufficient to upgrade/maintain unique  solutions for these platforms and the existing ASIP systems so a single  architecture is required.  Developing a unique solution for these  platforms would result in duplication of efforts. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however,  interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond  to the requirement to the POC’s listed.  Information received will be used  to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The  determination to compete this proposed effort based upon responses to this  notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Numbered note  22 applies. In accordance with recent Air Force Materiel Command Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement, the position of the ASC Ombudsman has been  terminated.  If any potential source has questions, comments or concerns  about this particular acquisition please direct all routine non-technical  issues to Mr. Brad Penn, Phone (937) 904-7149, e-mail:  bradley.penn@wpafb.af.mil and for technical issues contact Mr. John Frey,  Phone (937) 656-5999, e-mail: john.frey@wpafb.af.mil For more information on "Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP)  1C/2C SIGINT Sensor Development", please refer to:  https://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/pixs_solicitation.asp?id=5215

<SUBJECT>12--SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT FOR MINIATURE DAY/NIGHT SIGHT DEVELOPMENT FOR CREW-SERVED WEAPONS (MDNS-CSW)
<SOLNBR>N0016406R4810
<RESPDATE>060407
<CONTACT>MS. STACY MCATEE, 812-854-1988
<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the NSWC Division Crane. Amendment 0003: PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND:  The government previously held two industry pre-solicitation conferences for N00164-06-R-4810 FOR MINIATURE DAY/NIGHT SIGHT DEVELOPMENT FOR CREW-SERVED WEAPONS (MDNS-CSW).  This is to formalize and detail the planning announced to industry at those conferences.  The MDNS-CSW Development Project will be conducted in two major phases, immediate and long-term.  The immediate phase, Phase 1, will occur over the upcoming months and will establish a simple, partially-integrated baseline ensemble for MDNS-CSW.  The long-term phase, Phase 2, which will be conducted on a full and open competition basis, will be a fully integrated ensemble, which may require several years of developmental, test, and integration efforts.   SCOPE:  This announcement is expressly for Phase 1.  The immediate MDNS-CSW ensemble will consist of Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) subsystems, possibly supplemented by Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) or commercial and government Non-Developmental Item (NDI) subsystems.  No COTS/NDI items that have remaining developmental issues will be considered for Phase 1.  Any and all COTS/NDI submissions should already be in production or in production-ready status.  Any subsystems not in this status should not be submitted in Phase 1, being more appropriate for Phase 2. ACTIVITY:  The SOPMOD MDNS-CSW Project will utilize an independent Operational Test Agency (OTA) to conduct an Early User Assessment (EUA) of GOTS/COTS/NDI subsystems on or about 9-20 July, 2007.  The government participants in the EUA will mount, fire, and assess the various subsystems to establish which ensemble most closely meets the current MDNS-CSW Performance Specification and the operational tasks and missions outlined in applicable weapons field manuals and operators manuals.   OBJECTIVE:  The EUA results and other information may be used to develop a Market Survey Report.   There is no intent to procure anything other than existing GOTS items at this time, however, if any COTS/NDI items are found to be operationally superior to existing GOTS items, the Government may choose to procure these COTS/NDI items in relatively small quantities to support continued exploratory testing, or to meet urgent combat needs, until the long-term Phase 2 MDNS-CSW solution is achieved.  To be eligible for award, contractors must be properly registered in the Government's Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Offerors may obtain information on CCR registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet @ www.ccr.gov. WEAPONS OF INTEREST:  While the EUA may conduct exploratory testing of subsystems using any and all SOF Weapons in the inventory, the only weapons of interest currently planned for the EUA include: (1) the M2 HB .50 Caliber Machinegun, (2) the M240 7.62mm Machinegun, (3) the Mk19 40mm Machinegun, (4) the Mk13 .300 WinMag Sniper Rifle, and (5) the M3 84mm MAAWS.  These weapons are listed by priority of government effort to be given at the EUA.   GOVERNMENT SUBSYSTEMS:  The GOTS subsystems currently selected are to consist of SOPMOD Blocks 1 and 2, as well as various lasers and aiming items from other government programs. INVITATION TO VENDORS:  For vendors wishing to participate, the COTS/NDI items of interest correspond to those found in the N00164-06-R-4810 specification. Generically, these are: 1.  Crew Served Heavy Weapon Aiming Laser (CSHWAL) 2.  Visible Bright Light - Heavy (VBL-H) NOTE:  This also includes VBL-Medium for medium machineguns 3.  Remote Control Subsystem (RCS) NOTE: For Phase 1 these include remote controls of all kinds, to include switches, cables, video monitors, heads-up displays, helmet-mounted visual aids, etc. 4.  Rail Interface System - Heavy (RIS-H), NOTE: For Phase 1, these include any and all mounting solutions needed to mount COTS/GOTS items. 5.  Enhanced Combat Optical Sight - Heavy (ECOS-H)  6.  Laser Range Finder (LRF) 7.  Clip-On Night Vision Device - Heavy (CNVD-H) Vendors interested in participating in this immediate Phase 1 activity will: Submit, not later than 4 June 2007, 3:00PM Central Time:   1.  Two production or production-ready samples 2.  A signed letter statement of intent to participate, to include a corporate certification that the devices intended for submission are certified safe for intended use.  For items containing lasers, submit evidence of technical tests proving that the lasers are emitting within the ranges specified by their respective laser classes.  Also include any other vendor-supplied technical test data, such as shock, environmental etc.  The letter of intent should clearly explain how the submitted samples improve the operational capabilities of the weapons of interest. 3.  Pricing utilizing the attached table(s)  4.  Completed/signed Bailment Agreement(s)  5.  Standardized data sheet(s) (Documents referenced in 3, 4 and 5 above may be obtained at: http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/synopcom.htm 6.  Any other relevant manufacturer's information, such as Quick Reference Cards, Operators Manuals, and training materials.   Vendors will be notified by 15 June of the subjective opinion of the government as to whether or not the submitted items are within the scope of the EUA.  The government is not obligated to test items it determines are outside the scope of the EUA.  Items that will be considered outside the scope of the EUA include: 1.  Samples that have no clearly explained or apparent value to the increased operational capabilities of the weapons of interest; 2.  Samples that cannot be mounted to or otherwise applied to the weapons of interest; 3.  Samples not safe for intended use; or 4.  Passive day/night aiming systems for Sniper Rifles, a capability which is managed by a separate USSOCOM Program, namely the Integrated Night/Day Observation Device (INOD).  This program is independent of the SOPMOD Program and the MDNS-CSW Development Project.  Other sniper capabilities, such as active aiming, illumination, and ranging, are of interest to the EUA. If participants have questions regarding the applicability of their proposed samples, please send the questions by email to the Contract Specialist listed below. INVITATION TO CONDUCT NEW EQUIPMNENT TRAINING:  Industrial participants whose submissions are accepted in June will be invited to send factory representatives/instructors to deliver New Equipment Training (NET) on or about the second week of July 2007.  The exact times and location of the NET will be provided by later separate correspondence.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP):  Currently, the government desires to experiment and test GOTS, COTS/NDI, or militarized versions of COTS products, and has no interest in the acquisition of vendor intellectual property.  The government, however, wishes to maintain open system architectures, and will have very limited interest in items that restrict future spiral development by using proprietary interfaces.  The SOPMOD Program does not have technical data packages for the weapons and sighting systems listed above.  Please do not request drawings or descriptions.  PARTICIPATION:  This announcement is a public invitation.  Failure to participate in this Market Survey will not preclude abstaining vendors from bidding on possible future solicitations.  This announcement is part of the full-free-and-open competition process, which encourages industry and academia to help shape Government specifications to match what is possible, affordable, and timely.  Failure to participate in this open Market Survey process may result in a future Government performance specification over which the abstaining vendors have limited influence in the acquisition process, and may deprive abstaining vendors of potentially valuable direct early interaction with end-users, contracting officials, and acquisition planners.  Participating vendors will be provided access to redacted excerpts of the Market Survey Report, covering selected portions of the report limited to only the individual vendor's samples. Vendors who already have GOTS-qualified products may cons!  ider participating with the bailment loan of newly-manufactured items, since many GOTS items are in short supply and cannot be assured of being available for testing from government stockages.  Those available from government stockages may be in used or other unfavorable condition due to wartime demand. OTHER NOTES:  The government will provide common batteries at the EUA, such as BA5590, DL123, 3N, AA, and AAA series.  Vendors participating with samples requiring non-standard batteries should provide sufficient non-standard batteries for 96 hours of test operations.  All loaned items will be returned to vendors after the Market Survey Report is complete, on or about December, 2007.  It should be noted that during the course of this acquisition program, the Government plans to utilize employees from Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), Wexford Group International (WGI), Weapons System Technology Integration Center (WSTIAC), Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) and other direct Government contractors as advisors to the Government participants.  This sources sought announcement does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  The U.S. Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement or incurred for participation in this activity will NOT be reimbursed.  Any information provided that is marked as proprietary inf!  ormation will be safeguarded to prevent disclosures to non-government personnel and entities.  Your interest in this program is appreciated.  Questions should be directed to Ms. Stacy McAtee, Contracting Officer, Code 0562NS, telephone 812-854-1988, fax 812-854-5095, e-mail stacy.mcatee@navy.mil.

<RESPDATE>052207
<CONTACT>Annette deSercey at 850-235-5483 or Contracting Officer Tammy L. Bair at 850-636-6115.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City intends to issue a sole source contract to Sea-Bird Electronics Incorporated (SBE), 1808 136th Place NE, Bellevue, Washington for the acquisition of five (5) SBE 19-plus Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth (CTD) Optics-Ready Profilers (NAVOCEANO configuration).  The CTD systems being acquired are urgently needed to support mission essential operations aboard Navy military helicopters and ships supporting Mine Warfare (MIW) operations.  Because optical mine hunting systems are migrating to the fleet, the U. S. Navy has an immediate need to increase their optics/CTD sensor package deployments on military platforms.  These sensors provide data in support of other sensors used for oceanography, hydrography, ASW, home land security, MIW, Naval Special Warfare, and many other mission related tasks.  There are no other contractors other than Sea Bird that can provide a CTD that meets all of the U.S. Navy requirements.  Any changes!   to these requirements would adversely impact the mission of NAVOCEANO and our support to the MIW community.  Additionally, the U.S. Navy already has an enormous inventory of the same/similar Sea Bird sensors being purchased in this contract.    Changing vendors or instrumentation would call for a significant increase in funding to re-engineer current CTD/optics systems.  This would also require additional maintenance dollars and training programs to ensure data collection and database population.  Sea Bird has the required expertise to provide necessary calibrations and repairs to these COTS units.  Staying with COTS available instrumentation provides the greatest financial benefit for the government.

<DESC>This procurement consists of one solicitation with the intent to award one VTE Maintenance & Repair combination Firm Fixed Price/Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity to be performed at various Naval and Marine Corps installations located in Southern California.  This solicitation is full and open competition, and is to be procured as a commercial items acquisition in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 12.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code is 811310 and the size standard is $6.5 million dollars.  See explanation of size standards at the following website: http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/indexguide/index.html.  This procurement includes Option periods.  The performance period will include a 12-month base period, and nine 12-month option periods,  for a total maximum duration not to exceed 120 months.  THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO EVALUATE OFFERS AND AWARD A CONTRACT WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS WITH OFFERORS (EXCEPT CLARIFICATIONS AS DESCRIBED IN FAR 15.306(A)).  THEREFORE, THE OFFERORS INITIAL OFFER SHOULD CONTAIN THE OFFERORS BEST TERMS FROM A PRICE AND TECHNICAL STANDPOINT.  THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT DISCUSSIONS IF THE CONTRACTING OFFICER LATER DETERMINES THEM TO BE NECESSARY.  IF THE CONTRACTING OFFICER DETERMINES THAT THE NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE IN THE COMPETITIVE RANGE EXCEEDS THE NUMBER AT WHICH AN EFFICIENT COMPETITION CAN BE CONDUCTED, THE CONTRACTING OFFICER MAY LIMIT THE NUMBER OF PROPOSALS IN THE COMPETITIVE RANGE TO THE GREATEST NUMBER THAT WILL PERMIT AN EFFICIENT COMPETITION AMONG THE MOST HIGHLY RATED PROPOSALS.  The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Relative Importance of Evaluation Factors: The evaluation factors are divided into two categories; non-price evaluation factors (Factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) and price (Factor 7).  Factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are of equal importance.  When the proposal is evaluated as a whole, the non-priced Factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are approximately equal to price, Factor 7.  The importance of price will increase if offerors non-price proposals are considered essentially equal in terms of technical quality, or if price is so high as to significantly diminish the value of a proposal?s technical superiority to the Government.  Award will be made to the offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and represents the best value to the Government, price and non-price factors considered.  The evaluation factors are set forth below:
Factor 1: Experience
Factor 2: Past Performance
Factor 3: Key Personnel
Factor 4: Equipment & Inventory
Factor 5: Safety
Factor 6: Commitment to Socio-Economic Programs
Factor 7: Price
Offeror shall submit its proposal in two (2) separate parts as follows:

1) Technical Proposal: (original & 3 copies).  Address each of the following evaluation factors shown in FAR Clause 52.212-2 of the solicitation: Factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6.

2) Price Proposal: (original & 3 copies).  Include all other Price Proposal submission requirements shown in FAR Clause 52.212-2 of the solicitation.  Price proposal shall be submitted in a separate binder from the technical proposal, and clearly marked ?Price Proposal?.  Offerors shall complete Exhibits A through K.  Option Period 1 through 9.  OFFERORS SHALL COMPLETE ALL EXHIBIT LINE ITEM NUMBERS (ELINS) UNIT PRICES AND TOTAL AMOUNTS IN THE BASE YEAR AND FOR EACH OPTION PERIOD.    

While all proposed pricing will be fully evaluated in accordance with RFP Factor 7, the Government will consider only the sum total of the prices proposed for the following Exhibit Line Item Numbers (ELINs) to determine reasonableness, realism, and completeness for the purpose of performing any requiical trade-off analysis to determine the offeror proposing the best value to the Government: 

Base Year: 
FFP (ELINs A001 through A027)
IDIQ (ELINs A050 through A065)
Option 1:
FFP  (ELINs B001 through B027)
IDIQ (ELINs B050 through B065)
Option 2:

Option 9:
FFP  (ELINs K001 through K027)
IDIQ (ELINs K050 through K065)

In the event there is a difference between a unit price and the extended total amount, the unit price will be held to be the intended price and the total of the ELINs will be recomputed accordingly.  If the offeror provides a total amount for an ELIN but fails to enter the unit price, the total amount divided by the ELIN will be held to be the intended price.

<DESC>This synopsis provides notice of the Government's intent to solicit a proposal on a sole source basis with DNE Technologies, Inc., 50 Barnes Industrial Park, Wallingford, CT  06492-5920.  The contract type is anticipated to be a Firm Fixed Price commercial type contract.  In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, DNE Technologies, Inc. is the only known source capable of satisfying the Government's minimum requirement.  The Contract Line Item Numbers and descriptions are:  CLIN 0001 P/N 97681005 - Modules, NRZ MUX Modules, or Combo CDI MUX Modules, Front Panel Management Interface and Power Supply Module w/ Serial Management Interface (14 each); CLIN 0002 P/N 97680011 - Universal, NRZ-CDI-FIBER, Supports 62.5/50/9UM FIBER, JTC3A-9109C (70 each); CLIN 0003 Additional Two Year Warranty for a Total of 3 Years on the Above Equipment (1 Lot); CLIN 0004 Shipping (1 Lot).  This equipment will be used for communications and must be compatible/interoperable with the 2270 Modem from Canoga Perkins (Stand Alone Modem - 1310nm, SM, 10dB, LP Laser, ST; Interface Options -  R30-RS530/DB25; and Crystal Options - 08), and the CV-2048, CV-8448, and CV-MU CV-HTU-16 from DNE.  The MCU2 Converter is required to convert serial data from the Promina 800 multiplexer into a format suitable for sending over long distance fiber optic and copper cables.  The MCU2 also provides more capacity in a smaller form factor than earlier modems.  The MCU2 provides five modems in one RU space which meets the sponsor's interface requirements (four modems and one sparing requirement) and the requirement to reduce rack space.  The MCU2 Converter and Multiplexer is the only product that presently can convert multiple signals into a single fiber optic output reducing the amount of fiber optic required in the system.  The equipment must also be able to accept global power - nominally 120VAC 60HZ and 240VAC 50HZ.  The requested DNE Technologies equipment is the only equipment that meets the requirements listed.    THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.   However, responsible interested parties may submit a proposal in which they identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider all information received by 15 May 2007, 1530 EST.  A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government will not pay for any information received.  Facsimile proposals are acceptable.  Award is expected to be on or about 31 May 2007.   For information contact Cindy Wilson, Code 2.5.1.2.2.2, Telephone (301) 995-8672, FAX (301) 995-8670 or via e-mail: cindy.wilson@navy.mil.

<CONTACT>Erin Orthmeyer, Contract Specialist, Phone 310-653-9777, Fax null, Email erin.orthmeyer@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC>The Department of the Air Force, Space and Missile System Center (SMC) intends to issue a sole source contract to analyze the data and operational utility of RADARSAT-2 which is scheduled to launch in August 2007.    The proposed contract will be a study of RADARSAT-2 data for addressing warfighter and intelligence needs for Terrain Elevation and SAR Imagery data. This contract is valued at approximately $10,000,000.00.  This task requires access to and use of the RADARSAT-2 satellite which is scheduled to launch soon and replace the existing RADARSAT-1 which the United States Government has relied on for the past 12 years. 

 

MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd. (MDA) is the developer and owner of the RADARSAT-2 satellite.



The reason for conducting this study is to gather and extrapolate data from RADARSAT-2 and study user requirements in order to assess the benefit provided if MDA launches a clone satellite in close formation with RADARSAT-2 to include a topographic mission.   This type of tandem mission which has neither been built nor funded, could potentially provide an end-to-end solution for rapidly and securely developing an extremely high resolution topographic map of the earth's surface.   This study will support analysis of the uses and applications of such data to meet the US Government and warfighter needs.



The United States Government is the largest customer of RADRARSAT-1, the predecessor to RADARSAT-2, which has been in orbit for twelve years.  Once RADARSAT-2 is launched RADARSAT-1 will be retired.  This study will provide the US Government the opportunity to leverage and access data from the fully funded RADARSAT-2 satellite.  



Any persons or companies interested in this notice are to respond to the requirements and submit their capabilities and qualifications statement to the Technical Focal Point (LtCol Lawrence Halbach, SMC, (310) 426-8759, Lawrence.Halbach@losangeles.af.mil, or Erin Orthmeyer, SMC/XR, (310) 653-9777, Erin.Orthmeyer@losangeles.af.mil ).  The capabilities statement should explain why the person or company believes a sole source is invalid.  Responses from small business and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged.  Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, 8(a) firms, historically black colleges or universities, and minority institutions.  The capability and qualifications statement will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  A determination not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<CONTACT>DIANA ROMERO PURCHASING AGENT  3032369327     ;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey is conducting a two year study of water quality and biological habitat in several bayous in southeast Texas. Standard benthic macroinvertebrate samples will be collected from snags in 4 non-tidal streams and from bed sediment in 5 sites on Highland and Marchand Bayous which are tidally influenced. At these sites the USGS will use the Texas Commission of Environmental quality's tidal stream benthic macroinvertebrate assessment protocols, which require multiple samples at each site. Requirements for the tidal aspects include: 1) total sort on each sample, 2) identification to the lowest taxonomic level (i.e., genus/species) of all organisms where possible, including midges and worms, 3) sorting QA on all samples to ensure 90% sorting effectiveness, 4) synoptic reference collection checked by second taxonomist, data, including taxa lists, counts, and 5) summary metrics provided electronically. Requirement for the non-tidal aspect include: 1) 200 count sub-sample, 2) identification to the lowest taxonomic level (i.e., genus/species) of all organisms where possible, including midges and worms, 3) sorting QA on all samples to ensure 90% sorting effectiveness, 4) synoptic reference collection checked by second taxonomist, data, including taxa lists, counts, and 5) summary metrics provided electronically. This study mimics previous bayou studies that the USGS has completed in cooperation with the Houston-Galveston Area Council (H-GAC) and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, which previous studies have used EcoAnalyst Inc. Therefore, continuity of analytical source is critical for the historical comparison and interpretations of the data collected during previous studies and the current studies. This contract shall be for a base year of twelve months, plus one twelve month option. Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the services specified as a sole source from: EcoAnalyst Inc. and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis. However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required item or its functional equivalent (based upon the criteria specified herein) are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.

<DESC>The Innovative Partnerships Program (IPP) provides technology for Mission Directorates, Programs and Projects through investments and technology partnerships with industry, academia, government agencies and national laboratories.  As one of NASA’s Mission Support Offices, IPP supports all four Mission Directorates and has program offices at each of the ten NASA Centers. The IPP Partnership Seed Fund has been established as a new initiative to enhance NASA’s ability to meet mission technology goals by providing seed funding to address barriers and initiate cost-shared, joint-development partnerships.  The IPP Seed Fund is used to provide “seed” funding to enable larger partnerships and development efforts to occur and will encourage, to the maximum extent possible, the leveraging of funding, resources and expertise from non-NASA partners, NASA Programs and Projects and NASA Centers.  This internal Call to NASA Centers is soliciting proposals for cost-shared partnerships with industry, academia, research institutions, national laboratories and other government agencies for joint development of technology that is of Mission interest to NASA. This Call is being distributed through the Center IPP Offices (IPPO). In order to solicit external interest for partnerships through this Call, this Announcement is posted to www.Fedbizops.gov and http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/  website. Responses to this Announcement must be from NASA personnel participating as a Partnership Manager (PM) in the Center IPP Office; with proposals including both an internal NASA Co-Principal Investigator (Co-PI) and an External Co-PI.  As such, proposals submitted directly from parties external to NASA will not be accepted. Proposed projects must include one or more non-NASA partners who are willing to provide cost-sharing at a level equal to or greater than the IPP funding provided to the project.  However, special situations may arise in which IPP will allow a partner’s contribution to be less than the IPP Seed Fund contribution.  Acceptable cost-sharing from the partner includes actual dollars applied directly to the project, in-kind considerations such as workforce labor and the use of unique and dedicated facilities and testbeds.  Monetary valuation of partner in-kind facility and/or testbed access should be based solely on actual costs incurred by the partner in the performance of the proposed project, and should not reflect the partner’s already-incurred cost for developing the technology including the original capital expenditure for construction of the subject facilities and/or testbeds.  As an illustrative example of cost-sharing, the FY06 Seed Fund Call resulted in the following contributions:  IPP Contribution:	$6.6 M Other NASA Project/Program Contributions:	$7.5 M External (Non-NASA) Partner Contribution:	$14.2 M Grand Total:	$28.3 M For further information and questions regarding this announcement, kindly contact the IPP Points of Contact at any of the ten NASA Centers listed below.

<DESC>1.0	SUBJECT

Request for Information (RFI) for a Swipe Card type Entry system designed to provide entry and accountability services for Air Force Dormitory environments. Please submit responses via e-mail in Microsoft Office format by 3:00 (CST) PM on May 24, 2007.

2.0	DESCRIPTION

The Air Education and Training Command is seeking information from industry that will assist in the development and deployment of a Personnel Accountability (also referred to as Swipe Card Entry) system.  
	
Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information:

Conceptual technical architecture and alternatives 
a) Technical feasibility and alternatives assessments
b) Approximate cost information (i.e., order of magnitude, ballpark estimates, etc.) for alternatives
c) Information about commercially available solutions to minimize the need for special construction and associated costs and time delays
d) Schedule estimates
e) Ideas and suggestions that provide alternative approaches to designing, developing, acquiring, operating, and managing a Swipe Card Entry system.

3.0	REQUIREMENTS

This section enumerates the high-level functional requirements for Swipe Card Entry system. For purposes of responding to the RFI, requirements in the form of hypothetical locations to be served and associated traffic requirements for initial operational capability (IOC) will be made available to interested respondents at an information exchange meeting (see Section 6.0, below). 

a) There will be no interconnections or gateways to the Internet or other public or private networks.  This applies to any network management, control, and maintenance functions for this system as well.  Specific access using DoD CAC vehicle for delivery maybe considered.  

b) The potential for adding video surveillance may also exist as a secondary requirement at this time.  Video services to be supported will include, but not be limited to, video with time/date stamp, with or without motion sensing technologies. Multiple option responses will be accepted by the government.

c) Swipe Card Entry system will be a turnkey solution offered and priced as a service to the government, assuming a single invoice with supporting detail presented monthly will be acceptable.

SWIPE CARD REQUIREMENTS TABLE
See attachment 0001

Other requirements not directly related to physical network and services isolation will be addressed at a later date.  Examples of such requirements include security policies and security management requirements, required active defense measures, security of network management and control technologies, network capacities, service level agreements, and other important considerations.  

The purpose of this RFI is to gather information about those requirements enumerated above.  To the extent simplifying assumptions are needed, respondents are encouraged to make and document such assumptions in their responses.

4.0	POSSIBLE NETWORK SOLUTION

Swipe Card Entry system must meet the functional requirements specified above.  The Government is open to alternative concepts for solutions that meet these requirements.  The Government encourages creativity and outside the box thinking in responses to this RFI.  

This RFI seeks information about a fully dedicated non-shared network as well as other approaches that could meet the functional requirements with additional levels of sharing of personnel, equipment, and connectivity paths.  In doing so, the Government seeks to understand the tradeoffs among risks, costs (initial and ongoing) and alternative technical architectures that incorporate increasing degrees of sharing.  

Accordingly, respondents are encouraged to provide information about any alternatives that can be demonstrated to be immune from the kinds of disruptions described in section 3.0, above.

5.0	SAMPLE RESPONSE OUTLINE 

Following is a suggested outline and suggested page counts for a response to this RFI.  This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government.  Nevertheless, respondents are free to develop their response as they see fit. 

Section 1 Conceptual Architecture/Alternatives 

Briefly describe two or more alternative architecture concepts for Swipe Card Entry system, including the reliability and availability characteristics of the alternatives.  Discuss the capability for the architecture and advantages to described alternatives.  (3-5 pages per alternative with one diagram per alternative identifying the brand/type of equipment that would typically be deployed)

Section 2 Feasibility Assessment

Briefly describe the feasibility of each alternative and the design tradeoffs involved as matched against the functional requirements and risks of penetration.  (1 page per alternative)

Section 3 Cost and Schedule Estimates

Provide cost estimates for each alternative for 5 and 10-year contract terms for non-recurring and annual recurring costs using the locations provided at the public information exchange meeting (one page table).  Also, discuss cost drivers, cost tradeoffs, and schedule considerations (2-3 pages)

Section 4 Corporate Expertise

Briefly describe your company, your products and services, history, ownership, financial information, and other information you deem relevant.  (no suggested page count)

In particular, please describe any projects you have been involved in that are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI, including management and operations approach, security requirements, security assurance processes, and any relevant lessons learned (1-2 pages per project).  

Include any comments on the structure of the requirements for a formal RFP response.

Section 5 Additional Materials

Please provide any other materials, suggestions, and discussion you deem appropriate.

<DESC>A.	 General Information

     The Heartland Region, TRBO Region 5, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 5 Army, Navy, and Air Force, medical treatment facilities in Ohio, Illinois, and Kentucky announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Surgical Masks. The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. 
  The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Wright Patterson Air Force Base Ohio, Scott Air Force Base Illinois, Naval Health Clinics of Great Lakes Illinois, Blanchfield Army Community Hospital Ft Campbell Kentucky, and Ireland Army Community Hospital Ft Knox Kentucky.

     This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP?s Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The TRBO will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is July 2007. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The award will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade off criteria.    
   
Point of Contact Phyllis Targett 937-257-9075 phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil

B.	Products & Performance Required

The Heartland Region is seeking product line items in the category of Surgical Masks. The estimated total volume for this region for this product line is $24,791. This is based on historical prime vendor sales for a 12-month period. 

At the request of the Heartland Region Military Treatment Facilities vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.

C.	Instructions to Offerors

DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil (937) 257-9075 before 4:00 P.M. EST on the date listed for closing on the FBO announcement in order to remain competitive.
This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Heartland Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.
Phase I. Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation. All technical/company criteria are equally weighted.
Phase II. The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be non- clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs. A three-week period will be allotted to vendors for shipment. Samples must be received by COB at 4PM local time, 21 calendar days after request. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.
The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert-like one to five rating scale where one is equal to not acceptable and five is equal to highly acceptable. All criteria are weighted equally. The TPRB has set a 3.75 acceptability threshold for all product groups. Clinical/performance results lower than 3.75 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. 

Phase III. After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the 3.75 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Heartland Region. Vendors who fail to offer discounted prices will be disqualified from RIA award consideration.
Clinical/performance factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year base period with the option to extend for one or two-years (not to exceed 5 years). Vendors that fail to offer an incentive discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  
  

1. Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation

The TPRB will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability. Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally responses to all questions in this section demonstrate that: 1) the business concern offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; 2) based on the quoter?s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services offered meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 3) the quoter has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items; 4) the quoter has, or is obtaining, a distribution agreement covering the items with the Prime Vendor for the region; and 5) the quoter intends to offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to offer a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and 6) the quoter?s information provided is factually correct (any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.)

<SUBJECT>99 -- THE COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE BLIND OR SEVERELY DISABLED - NOTICE
<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.

This notice concerns an action which may affect your company's continued business with the Federal Government and should not be disregarded.  It is in your best interest to respond to this notice.

The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (P/L).  You can view the P/L on our website at www.jwod.gov.  Once a product is added to the P/L to be performed by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.

The Committee has been asked to consider adding the following product to the P/L:
Dry Erase Starter Kit, NSN: 7520-00-NIB-1158.  The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration, Region 2, New York, NY.    

Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Dry Erase Starter Kits to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are the Marks-A-Lot Desk Style Markers, Eraser and Cleaner Set (AVE-23503) and Expo Dry Erase Starter Set (SAN-83153).

In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:  

1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period

2) Revenues accrued by providing dry erase starter kits to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period 

3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.  

The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than May 23, 2007 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed product be added to the P/L.

It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to
(703) 603-0030.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.

When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.

General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.jwod.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the P/L, please contact Ms. Connie Mehr at (703) 603-2116.

PROTECTION/SAFEGUARDING OF THE BAILED PROPERTY 6.1  The Bailee must provide a covered, climate controlled, secure facility within 20 miles of NSWC PC.  Potential Bailees with facilities outside the 20-mile radius are invited to submit proposals, however they are cautioned that proximity is a discriminating  factor when choosing the successful Bailee.  The facility must be of ample size to support all equipment charged to the Bailee’s care.  The Bailee may be provided up to 15 days from the award of this Agreement to secure a suitable facility. 6.2  The title to all Bailor’s equipment shall remain with the Government.  The Bailee shall maintain adequate property control records in accordance with sound industrial practices and will make such records available for Government inspection at all times. 6.3  The Bailee must have ISO 9001 compliant procedures within 180 days of receipt of the equipment.  Official registry of the said procedures is preferred. 6.4  The Bailee must be cleared / authorized to work with, possess, provide testing on and store Government materials up to and including SECRET classification.  The Bailee’s facility must have all appropriate security features installed to ensure materials provided remain secure.   6.5  Testing conducted and reports written by the Bailee will be independent of the Navy, NAVSEA, and NSWC PC and will require a PE (professional engineer) signature to validate the report. 6.6  Bailee will be required to maintain, certify for use, and safely operate equipment provided to applicable Government and/or industry standards. 6.7  The Bailee will be responsible for the procurement of any ancillary equipment required to operate test equipment provided.  Bailee will have 180 days to set up equipment for operation.   7.  U.S. NAVY USE OF BAILED EQUIPMENT 7.1 General:  The Government anticipates that from time to time it will have the need for the test services of a facility of this expected type and capability.  If and when such a requirement exists, the parties agree as follows; a.  The Government will be considered a priority customer.  As such, its requirements will be accorded priority over any non-Government requirements.  b.  Any Government requirements for environmental test services by the Bailee will be handle by separate purchase arrangement and are not considered part of this Agreement. c.  The Bailee will be considered a potential source for environmental test services, but this agreement does not commit the Government to purchase any services nor provide the Bailee any preferred status in the selection and awarded of any specific purchase actions for environmental test services.  d.  Fair compensation will be paid to the Bailee for any services provided with the Bailor’s equipment.  The amount paid to the Bailee for services utilizing the Government property specified herein will be as specified in individual purchase agreements.  However, as part of this agreement, the parties hereto agree that any equipment use rates (or similar charging structure) that involves the use of any of the above Government-owned property in the performance of a U.S. Navy awarded procurement  will be discounted by a minimum of  20 percent from those rates charged non-Federal customers.  e.  The Bailee shall be free to provide services to any and all others for profit with the Bailed equipment.  This Agreement will in no way prohibit the Bailee from making a profit with the Bailed equipment except occasions of emergency or scheduled work for NSWC PC defined in this Agreement.  7.2   Scheduled work The Bailor agrees act in good faith and provide the Bailee with as much advanced notice as possible to allow the Bailee to schedule all work.  The Bailee agrees to provide NSWC PC personnel with priority access to testing services.  Upon official notification to the Bailee from the contracting officer or representative, the Bailee will have 7 days to reschedule or complete work and make services ready for NSWC PC. 7.3	Emergency work Upon official notification from the contracting officer or representative of an emergency need for testing services, the Bailee must make every effort to provide testing services within 24 hours. 7.4	Modification of Equipment  The Bailee may modify equipment from its current configuration to accommodate testing needs.  All modifications shall be temporary unless mutually agreed upon in writing by the Bailee and Bailor’s  contracting officer.  8.  TRANSPORTATION OF BAILED EQUIPMENT The Bailee will take possession of equipment onboard Naval Support Activity-Panama City (NSA PC) at building 490.  The Bailee shall disconnect and tear down equipment from its existing location in building 490 aboard NSA PC, transport to their location and set-up for operation.  The Bailee assumes all cost and liability upon the receipt of equipment until such time as the Agreement is expired, or mutually cancelled. The Bailee assumes all cost associated to bring the equipment up to applicable industry and Government standards.  The Bailor stipulates that equipment may be deemed antiquated by mutual agreement of the Bailor’s representative and the Bailee.  A final decision on that equipment will be made by the contracting officer or his/her designated representative.  9.  COST OF BAILMENT It is agreed by the Parties that the Bailed Property shall be provided under the Agreement at no cost to the Bailee or to any employees, officers, or instrumentalities of the United States of America. 10.  DAMAGE TO OR LOSS OF BAILED PROPERTY Bailee shall be liable for the loss of or damage to the Bailed Property while in the possession of the Bailee solely to the extent provided in accordance with the Federal Torts Claims Act (FTCA).  Bailee shall not be responsible for wear and tear to the Bailed Property that is occasioned by normal and ordinary usage.  In the event of loss or irreparable damage to the bailed property, the Bailee’s maximum liability shall not exceed the Agreed Value of the Bailed Property. 11.  GOVERNING LAW This Agreement shall be governed by the Federal laws and regulations of the United States of America. 12.  LIABILITY The Bailor shall not be responsible for damages to the property of Bailee or the property of others, or for personal injuries to the Bailee’s officers, agents, servants, or employees, or to other persons, arising from or incident to the use of the property herein bailed.  In addition, the Bailee shall indemnify and hold the Government harmless from any and all such claims; provided that nothing contained in this clause shall be deemed to affect any liability the Government has to its own employees. (end of agreement) DISCRIMINATING FACTORS for selection of Bailee This proposed Bailment Agreement is being publicized as a Special Notice in the Government Point of Entry (GPE).  In order to be considered for assignment of this Agreement, prospective Bailees shall respond to this notice with the following information: 	Factor 1:  Does the proposed bailee have the expertise to safely and effectively operate the environmental test equipment to be bailed?

<SUBJECT>Q-- Draft TRICARE Active Duty Dental Program RFP
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS; IT IS STRICTLY A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION AND COMMENTS ON A DRAFT SOLICITATION FROM POTENTIAL OFFERORS WHO ALREADY HAVE A FULLY DEVELOPED NATIONAL DENTAL PROVIDER NETWORK.

The Department of Defense is interested in obtaining a contract for a complete dental health care delivery system known as the Active Duty Dental Program (ADDP) which will provide the complete range of dental care for all active duty service members (ADSMs) located within the United States and designated territories who are authorized to seek dental health care services within the civilian community to ensure world-wide deployability and maintainability. The contractor shall provide an extensive dental provider network covering the United States, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands, for authorized dental care. The contractor shall also provide associated administrative services, such as customer service, provider reimbursement, education, etc. that are determined by the contractor as necessary to support a complete dental health care delivery system, or as specifically required by the Government. While the contractor will provide a dental network, the ADDP is not an indemnity program as there are no monthly premiums. 

The ADDP has two components: dental coverage for ADSMs referred from military Dental Treatment Facilities (DTF) for civilian care and dental coverage for ADSMs under the Remote Active Duty Dental Program (RADDP). The RADDP is to provide dental care to ADSMs on continuous active duty orders for more than 30 days and who have a duty location and residence greater than 50 miles from a DTF. In addition, Reservists and National Guard members on active duty may be covered when injured while serving on orders. Extensive DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process and Physical and Personnel Security requirements will have to be met by the contractor.

The draft solicitation will be made available electronically on the TMA industry forum website on or about May 14, 2007. To obtain a copy of the Draft ADDP Request for Proposal (RFP), go to the TMA industry forum website at http://www.tricare.mil/contracting/healthcare/industryforum/ and scroll down to Dental Services and click on RFI- ADDP. Paper copies of the draft solicitation will not be provided by the Government. To access the draft solicitation, go to the above website on or after May 14, 2007. 

NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED. ALL QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED USING THE *E-MAIL QUESTIONS TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER* OPTION ON THE TRICARE WEBSITE.

<SUBJECT>B -- Partner to Demonstrate Advanced Wind Turbines at U.S. EPA, Research Triangle Park, NC
<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency located in Research Triangle Park (EPA-RTP), NC, is interested in demonstrating advancements in small scale wind turbine technologies.  Located near the geographic center of North Carolina, EPA-RTP is situated in a Class 1 wind field.  This wind classification is traditionally considered unsuitable for wind power.  However, an in-house literature review indicates that recent advances in small scale wind turbines (WT) may enable RTP to take advantage of micro environmental factors that would enable operation in low wind regimes.  

The EPA-RTP campus consists of 8 buildings, one of which is EPA's newest and largest research facility totaling more than 1.1 million sq. ft.  The buildings range in height from approximately 30 to 40 meters with parapets above the local tree line. They are grouped in a shallow ?V? with an open plaza at the bottom of the ?V.?  Given the local terrain, the physical layout of the buildings and their elevations, EPA-RTP believes that it might have a micro-environment that could accommodate advanced vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT) and horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWT) designs.

Therefore, EPA-RTP invites one or more Partners to demonstrate their respective technologies on the RTP site on a no cost, non-reimbursable basis.  The demonstration shall consist of at least one or more VAWTs and HAWTs.  As a minimum, the Partner shall help EPA-RTP size an appropriate WT, provide the technology, train EPA staff in its operation, advise EPA on it operation, and assist EPA in optimizing its location.  EPA-RTP will provide necessary equipment to monitor each technology?s performance (e.g. data logger, computers, etc) and provide essential maintenance.  

These WTs shall not be hooked into any of the building?s electrical systems or onto the local electrical grid.  However, pertinent data such as wind direction, wind speed, kWh generation, etc shall be continuously recorded for analysis.  The demonstration shall last a minimum of 1 year at which time at which time, based on the results of the analysis, EPA-RTP will determine how to proceed.  Each Partner shall have access to all data generated by their respective technology during the demonstration, and the technologies will be returned to the respective Partners.

Entities seeking to join EPA-RTP in this demonstration are asked to provide pertinent technical information, including photos, on the performance of their technology under low wind conditions.  The selection of a Partner(s) will be based on the potential for success of the proposed technology, the contribution of the individual WT to EPA-RTP?s goal of demonstrating a variety of technologies, and its impact on or contribution to site aesthetics.  Interested Partners are invited to tour the site at their own expense.  Or a virtual tour is available at htttp://www.epa.gov/rtp/facilities/maincampus.htm.  

The EPA-RTP campus was designed and built with the goal of demonstrating EPA's commitment to environmental stewardship.  It is recognized both nationally and internationally as a leading example of green building.  Currently, 100% of its electrical consumption is offset through the purchase of renewable energy certificates.  In addition, EPA-RTP is the home of North Carolina's largest solar powered generator and our access roads are lit by solar powered street lights.  To further strengthen its role as an environmental steward, EPA-RTP is committed to the advancement and use of alternative energy resources.  This WT demonstration is intended to be highly visible symbol of that commitment.

Interested parties requiring additional information or desiring to set up a site visit should contact:  James B. White at white.james@epa.gov.  Notification of interest in participating in this demonstration and supporting technical information should be mailed to James B. White, 109 T.W. Alexander Drive, Mail Code C604-05, Research Triangle Park, NC, 27711.

<SUBJECT>A -- Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Contract for the Continuation of FORESTER/A160 Hummingbird Integration and Ground/Flight Test Research Activities
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Information Exploitation Office (IXO), intends to award a Sole Source contract to the Boeing Company - Advanced Systems, Huntington Beach, CA for flight test support for flying the FORESTER radar onboard A160 Hummingbird unmanned helicopter.  Under DARPA Agreement No. MDA972-03-9-0004 Boeing is developing, maturing and demonstrating the A160 unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) helicopter.  In addition under Phase 2 and 3A (also performed on DARPA Agreement No. MDA972-03-9-0004) the Boeing Company developed plans for integration of the DARPA Foliage Penetration (FOPEN) Reconnaissance, Surveillance, Tracking and Engagement Radar (FORESTER).  The Phase 2 and 3A activities included aerodynamic and mechanical analyses to ensure the FORESTER antenna will not degrade the A160 performance and handling, development of hardware and software interface control documents and integration plans for installing the FORESTER payload onto the A160 air vehicle and FORESTER ground components into the A160 ground control station, and development of A160 control laws that will enable the A160 to station-keep to the accuracy required for FORESTER operation.  Under the Phase 3B effort a sole source contract HR0011-07-C-0048 was issued to the Boeing Company in March 2007 to install the FORESTER payload onto the A160, conduct ground vibration tests and electromagnetic compatibility tests, and perform a limited set of flights of the A160 with the FORESTER onboard to verify radar operation.

The subject Phase 3C sole source contract will require the Boeing Company to fly the FORESTER on the A160 a series of demonstration campaigns at sites within the United States to quantify the FORESTER?s ability to detect targets under foliage and to demonstrate military utility under a variety of conditions.  The Boeing Company will be responsible for operating the A160 air vehicle and ground station for these flights.  The Phase 3C efforts will take place over a six to nine month period. The Phase 3C effort is a logical follow-on to the on-going research effort being conducted by the Boeing Company under Phase 3A (Agreement No. MDA976-03-9-0004) and Phase 3B (contract HR0011-07-C-0048).  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1 ?Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.?  As the developer of the A160 Hummingbird, the Boeing Company possesses unique knowledge, capabilities and proprietary intellectual property/data required to carry out the required research effort.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is currently available.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  Responses/proposals received within forty-five (45) days after date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open basis is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to meet the requirements by submitting a white paper and past performance data by no later than 25 June 2007 to Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Attn: Mr. Michael D. Blackstone, Contracts Management Office (CMO), 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 or via email to michael.blackstone@darpa.mil.

<SUBJECT>--Process Capability, Control & Improvement Requirements
<DESC>A Joint Munitions & Lethality Life Cycle Management Command (JM&L LCMC) joint services team is proposing under an effort to implement a higher level system for Supplier Quality (SQ) to replace local / non standard clauses used in the procurement of c ommon munitions with a single, integrated clause to be used by all JM&L LCMC. The local / non standard clauses to be replaced are referenced in standard contractual language used by Joint Munitions Command (JMC), Rock Island Arsenal and Armaments Research Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC), Picatinny Arsenal. For the effort outlined here-in the JMC clause to be replaced is currently referenced as (ES7034) STATISTICAL PROCESS CONTROL (SPC) (MAR 2006) 52.246-4506 and the ARDEC clause to be replaced is  currently referenced as ARDEC 32 - Alternatives to Lot Acceptance Sampling (Including Statistical Process Control (SPC)). There are other tailored, program unique variations of these two clauses that are intended to be replaced as well. The new clause is commonly referred to as the Process Capability, Control and Improvement Clause, or simply PCCI clause. The proposed clause will support realization of the intent of MIL-STD-1916, DOD Preferred Method for Acceptance of Product. The PCCI cl ause is adaptable to item complexity, intended use, quantity being procured, cost and industrial base capability by the selection of key characteristics, processes or operations, allowing measured improvement over time and shifting the focus of quality req uirements from detection to prevention. A significant change from prior quality requirements is that objective evidence of process control of key characteristics, processes or operations from the production of a product is a deliverable as part of that pro ducts Lot Acceptance Data Package and a requirement for acceptance of that product. PCCI also requires an in-depth review and analysis of the manufacturing process, manufacturing process risks and identification of methods to monitor and control key chara cteristics, processes and operations. This in-depth effort is to be documented in the form of a Process Control Plan (PCP) and submitted as a contract deliverable and be approved by the Government prior to First Article Acceptance Testing (FAAT) or product ion when an FAAT is not required. PCCI requirements are intended to improve product quality by increasing manufacturing process knowledge and capability and assist in supplier preparation and submission of requests for acceptance by contractor proposed pro visions. The PCCI clause is currently implemented on one (1) pilot program and it is anticipated that it will be implemented on selected additional pilot programs before replacing the previously mentioned local / non standard clauses.  Suppliers are encouraged to b ecome familiar with the clause and email questions, comments and  feedback on the PCCI requirement to the government POC listed below.   Point of Contact Mike Berry (973) 724-2833 Email your questions to: michael.james.berry@us.army.mil Additional Information Link to PCCI Clause and Supplier Presentation online

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Firms lacking a record of relevant past performance history, or for whom information on past performance is not available, shall receive a neutral evaluation.  Marine shipyard experience is required.  Proposals not meeting this requirement may be determined unacceptable.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.

This amendment is to post questions and answers regarding this solicitation.  Please note that Amendment #2 extended the due date for proposals to May 30, 2007 12:00PM (EST).  

Question 47:  In section 7.1.6 the RFP outlines a requirement for small learning teams to be assigned a facilitator for each of the one week-long modules.  Are we correct in assuming the contractor is providing these facilitators?  
Answer 47:  Yes

Question 48:  The RFP states that a facilitator is to be assigned to each learning team.  If learning team activities are built into the program through out each week long session is it the government?s expectation that there will be three facilitators/instructors on site for each week long session?  
Answer 48:  Yes three facilitators can move between cohorts if this does not affect quality, efficiency and reduces costs to the Government.  Any time that small groups are working independent from the cohort a facilitator is required.

Question 49:  Will the contractor be responsible for assigning learning team activities? 
Answer 49:  Yes

 Question 50:  Section 7.1.9 outlines a requirement for the 360 assessment results to be available at the first classroom session, scheduled per the RFP for June 3, 2007.  Is the government?s expectation that the 360 will be administered and assessments completed by all subjects and raters by the June 3 session?  Assuming contract award is made within five days of the solicitation due date, May 15, 2007, this only allows for eight business days for responses to be collected from all subjects and raters.
Answer 50:  The first cohort is scheduled for June 24, , 2007 and the proposals are due May 30, 2007.   The 360 will be administered and assessments completed by all subjects and raters prior to the June 24, 2007 cohort. 
 
 
Question 51:  In section 7.1.12 the RFP mentions a cohort graduation.  Is the contractor responsible for planning and leading the cohort graduation activities and will this take place at the end of the third cohort session? 
Answer 51:  The contractor is not responsible for planning or leading the graduation activities but is expected to participate in the activity which will take place at the end of cohort 3.
 
Question 52:  Section 9.4 states a requirement for a post-program assessment to determine roi.  Is this assessment targeted towards the mentor and participant supervisor?  Can the government provide any additional requirements for the assessment and analysis expected from the contractor? 
Answer 52:  The mentor and participant should be included in any final assessment and the proposal may include other complementary information sources that will be incorporated into the analysis.

 
Question 53:  Have job task analysis been performed for the various positions that the participants would be considered for?   If so, would they be available for the awarded proposer?
Answer 53:  Some have and some have not.  For the analysis that MSHA does have we can make those available after contract award.

Question 54:  Have the prospective candidates undergone a preliminary assessment in leadership proficiencies in a formal selection process? 
Answer 54:  YES

Answer 59:  MSHA requires a program as specified in the statement of work.

Question 60:  It?s implicit to us that is not what MHSA expects;  please clarify that MHSA expects a Leadership Development Program that is designed and developed specifically for the ?pool of employees.?  
Answer 60:   MSHA requires a Leadership Development Program that complies with the solicitation.

Question 61:  Assuming a program specifically developed for MHSA, then what time frame would MHSA schedule for ?design and development? for he first module?  
Answer 61:  The design and development would be provided in your proposal.  

Question 62:  Is the June 3rd start date still the target date, or is a later start date being considered:

Answer 63:  This sentence is referring to the methodologies.   

Question 64:  Are the number of hours per full day (Monday ? Thursday) limited?  That is, can activities be planned into the evenings on those days, such that some days could extend to 10 ? 12 hours?  
Answer 64:  See 7.1.8 of the statement of work.

Answer 65:  BOTH

Question 66:  Item 7.1.9 calls for a 360?a feedback and MBTI.      Are all participants in a leadership position or be in one prior to attending?   
Answer 66:  NO   

Question:  67:  Will other developmental assessments be considered by MHSA?    Assessments  such as the Hogan Suite focus directly on leadership development, coaching and mentoring.  Please advise.  
Answer 67:  The question is not fully understood.  The proposal is expected to comply with all the solicitation requirements.  

Question 68:  Item 7.1.10  . . . . . . the RFP stated: ?The contractor shall provide a ? day mentoring development session?  . . . we assume the ??? is a ?1? . . . correct?  ? Day.                                                                   
Answer 68:  The contractor shall provide a one half day mentoring development session for the mentors that MSHA will identify and match to each participant. MSHA will schedule the mentors to receive their one half training and work with their mentees the remaining one half day toward the later part of each participant?s first week of training.  (i.e. interact with trainers/facilitators, work with mentee in the development of ILDP, develop a mentor/mentee agreement)  

Question 69:  7.1.11  What is MSHA?s ?knowledge transfer assignment? to be provided to each participant?  
Answer 69:  MSHA will provide assignments i.e. interviewing MSHA Leaders that are preparing to retire, preparing a paper and presenting back at classroom session.  

Question 70:  The underpinning of MHSA is safety . . . . . . . does MHSA expect a safety tie-in to the leadership development program?    Please advise. 
Answer 70:   MSHA is only interested in a leadership program that addresses the program content described in the solicitation.

Question 71:  Does MHSA expect a meeting or a comprehensive conference call with the awardee  prior to commencing with Cohort 1?   
Answer 71:  YES

Question 72:  This solicitation is a total small business set aside. Has it been determined that this must be 100% set aside for small businesses, or would a large business be considered? 
Answer 72:  No

Question 73:  If this solicitation must go to a small business, who would MSHA recommend a large business contact to discuss teaming arrangements?
Answer 73:  No

Question: 74:  When is the anticipated award date of this solicitation? 
Answer 74:  It is anticipated that an award will be made within the first two weeks of June but this is not guaranteed.

Question 75:  Section 2.0 of the RFP states: ??designed for preparing journeyman level technical personnel?? What types of backgrounds can we expect of the ?journeyman? personnel coming into this program? 
Answer 75:  Primarily technical mine inspectors, safety and health specialist and engineers.  (See background information in the RFP) 

Question 76:  Section 7.1.4 of the RFP states: ??Necessary changes and adjustment will be made to the program based on this feedback.?  What is the anticipated level of changes required from the first cohort to subsequent cohorts? How will these changes affect and be incorporated into MSHA?s proposed schedule? 
Answer 76:  It amount of adjustments depend on the feedback received from the Pilot Group in Module 1, who are existing supervisors. A schedule change is not anticipated.

Question 77:  Section 7.1.5 of the RFP states: ?Provide a 3 week residential program that will be delivered in one week increments over approximately an 8 month period at the MSHA training facility at Beaver, West Virginia.?  Our understanding is that MSHA wants to implement a 3 week residential program mapping the OPM Executive Core Qualifications. Given these core qualifications cover many topics, can we assume MSHA would accept a proposed curriculum of 5 to 6 courses if they could be offered within the 3 week constraints, covering the topic areas of the OPM requirements?  
Answer 77:  The question is not clear.  The proposal is expected to comply with the solicitation. 

Question 78:  Is there any chance the MSHA would extend each cohort to 4 weeks if it meant a more comprehensive and robust delivery of content? We ask this especially given the time constraints that some of the additional program requirements put on this program (i.e. keynote speakers, mentorship programs, individual coaching).
Answer 78:  no

Question 79:  Section 7.1.6 of the RFP states: ?Each cohort shall be comprised of small learning teams; with a maximum of eight participants per team, with an assigned facilitator for each team for each of the 3 one week-long modules.?
We interpret this to mean that each cohort will have three instructors (one for each of the three teams). Given our experience and instructional expertise, we feel that assigning three instructors per 20-25 students is an unnecessary expense for MSHA to incur. Answer 79:  It is acceptable to propose three facilitators that can move between cohorts if this does not affect quality, efficiency and reduces costs to the Government.  Any time that small groups are working independent from the cohort a facilitator is required.

Question 80:  Section 7.1.7 and 7.1.8 of the RFP refers to the need for ?combined activities? between cohorts. It also described the need for evening activities.  Please elaborate on the specifics of these ?combined activities.? Given the residential nature of this program, we assume that these combined activities can be planned as evening activities outside of the classroom. This would prevent these combined activities from cutting in on the instructor?s time.   
Answer 80:  Yes?.Combined activities are meant to be team building and knowledge sharing.  How you propose to schedule the available time is up to you.


Question 81:  Section 7.1.9 of the RFP states: ?The contractor shall provide the results of both the 360 and MBTI to the participant during their first classroom session. The contractor shall provide each participant with a minimum of one hour individualized coaching session on their assessment results.?  This requirement literally translates to 24 hours of individual coaching time for the instructor. Given the other time constraints of the requirements for this program, when should these coaching sessions take place?
Answer 81:  Please include this information in the proposal

Question 82:  Section 7.1.9 of the RFP describes the 360 and MBTI administration. Does MSHA want the MBTI integrated into the training?  Do all instructors need to be MBTI certified?  What kind of 360 does MSHA desire? 
Answer 82:  Yes, MSHA wants the MBTI integrated into the training. You should choose one that supports the training program you propose.

Question 83:  Section 7.1.10 of the RFP describes mentoring development sessions for the program.  Can you please clarify the specifics of this requirement? As we understand it, MSHA will identify outside mentors and match them to cohort participants.  Does the vendor provide the half day mentorship training? 
Answer 83:  Yes the vendor provides the one half day mentorship training.  

Question 84:  Is the vendor to work in a half day of mentor/mentee interaction during class time of the first week? 
Answer 84:  Yes

Question 85:  Section 7.1.1 of the RFP mentions ?application of leadership theory as it pertains to MSHA.? What are MSHA?s expectations regarding ?application of leadership?? Does MSHA want the vendor to tailor delivery from the podium or expect customized course materials ahead of time?
Answer 85:  Course material shall be provided in proposal.

Question 86:   Sections 8.6 and 8.7 of the RFP describe the meal arrangements for the instructors and participants. Are we to assume that dinner will be provided as well for the instructor by MSHA?  
Answer 86:  MSHA will provide meals as described in 8.7 of the solicitation.  MSHA will provide Breakfast and Lunch and Refreshments.  

Question 87:  Section 13 of the RFP states: ?The contractor shall describe fully its company capabilities and present a design for the LDP, including a detailed agenda, learning objectives, topics, activities/practical exercises, and proposed assessment tools and participant evaluations??
What level of detail is expected in answering this section, i.e. are you looking for a full design of the program or a more general discussion of the design elements?
Answer 87:  The proposal calls for a design, as described in the statement of work.

Question 88:  Section 2 mentions that Developmental Assignments will be a part of the MSHA leadership program but no specific requirements for developmental assignments are outlined in the solicitation.  Does the government intend to include this in the program?  
Answer 88:  Please see 7.1.11:  The contractor shall develop a list of potential assignments and readings that support or enhance the classroom learnings and/or the participants individual needs as identified by the assessment process.   The list shall be a part of the proposal and MSHA will approve the list within 5 days of a contract award.   These assignments shall be completed by the participants during the time between the classroom sessions. Additionally, MSHA will provide a knowledge transfer assignment for each participant.   Participants will include assignments with milestones and completion dates in their ILDP.  The participants individual assignments will be reviewed and approved by the participants mentor and the COTR before being finalized in their ILDP.     The participants progress on assignments in the ILDP shall be tracked and recorded.     The participants must complete all items in the ILDP before the end of the cohort.     Subsequent changes to the participants ILDP must be approved by both the mentor and the COTR.     (see deliverable)

STATEMENT OF WORK
1. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES. The contractor shall provide all management, tools, supplies, equipment, and labor necessary to ensure the tilling of petroleum-contaminated soils and general grounds maintenance are performed at Grand Forks Air Force Base?s Land Treatment Facility (LTF).  The LTF is located northwest of the Alert Ramp on the west side of the base.

1.1.1.  Tilling.  The Contractor shall provide tilling of petroleum-contaminated soils (PCSs) during the growing season IAW NDAC 33-20-09-02.4.d.  Tilling, in the conventional sense of actually using a garden tiller, can be used to accomplish this task.  However, a disc, chisel plow, or some other method approved by 319 CES/CEV would also be acceptable.  The existing PCSs, consisting of approximately twenty (20) acres, shall be tilled four (4) times during the 2007 growing season.  The first tilling shall take place within 15 days of notice to proceed, weather permitting, with the fourth tilling taking place approximately 1 Oct 07.  PCSs introduced during the growing season shall be tilled as many times that remain in the growing season; evenly spaced between the first and fourth tilling, weather permitting.
1.1.2.  Remove Debris/Police Grounds.  The Contractor shall remove material such as concrete, rebar, wood, or other inert construction debris that may be present in some of the PCSs requiring tilling.  The Contractor shall remove these materials as they become evident from tilling and properly dispose of them at an offbase location in accordance with existing local, state, and federal regulations.
1.1.3.  Grounds Maintenance:
The boundaries of the LTF (Exhibit A) are the berms along the west (A-B), north (A-D), and east (C-D).  The south boundary is defined by the southern edge of the road (B-C).
1.1.3.1 Mowing/Trimming.  Grounds maintenance tasks at the LTF shall include all grasses, birch, and tree saplings.  The following areas shall be mowed, trimmed, and maintained two (2) times during 2006 as directed by 319 CES/CEVC. 
?	All berms, including the boundary berms and all interior berms;
?	Areas not utilized for soil remediation or tilled within the boundaries;
?	An additional twelve (12) feet beyond the berms and LTF road;
?	A five-foot radius around each of nine monitoring wells (MW); and,

2.  GENERAL:

2.2. GOVERNMENT REMEDIES.  The contracting officer shall follow the requirements of FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions for Commercial Items (May 1999), for contractor?s failure to correct nonconforming services.
2.3. CORRECTIVE ACTION.  The contractor shall, upon receipt of a notice in writing of any noncompliance with the foregoing provisions, take immediate corrective action.  If the contractor fails or refuses to comply promptly, the contracting officer may issue an order stopping all or part of the work until satisfactory corrective action has been taken.  No part of the time lost due to any such stop orders shall be made the subject of a claim for extension of time or for excess costs of damages by the contractor unless it was later determined that the contractor was in compliance.
2.4.  EQUIPMENT.  Equipment brought on site shall be in good working order and not be leaking any fluids.  All subcontractors shall be licensed, if applicable.  Material safety data sheets (MSDSs) must accompany all chemicals brought onto GFAFB.
2.5.  WORK ENVIRONMENT.  Petroleum odors may become strong while tilling.  Therefore, it may be necessary to work with approriate respirador protection.
2.6.  HOURS OF OPERATION.  Normal hours of operation for Grand Forks AFB and access to the LTF are  0730 to 1600,  Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays.  Notification for entry shall be made two days prior to scheduled maintenance.  Contact 319 CEV/CEVC at 747-6397 or 747-6154 for access.
2.7.  SECURITY REQUIREMENTS.  
2.7.1.  This purchase order will entail work in areas requiring base entry only.
2.7.2.  PASSES AND ID?S.  The contractor shall obtain personal identification passes for all employees and vehicle passes (Air Force Form 75, Visitor/Vehicle Pass) for all contractor and personal vehicles requiring entry onto GFAFB.  The contractor must complete form SFS 74 for each employee working on base, and submit it through the contracting officer to the Security Forces and Pass and Registration.

THE CONTRACTOR MUST SUBMIT AN ALTERNATIVE ROUTE PLAN ALONG WITH THEIR PRIMARY ROUTE PLAN IN THEIR PROPOSAL.  

If one or more facilities cannot be accessed for an extended period of time due to but not limited to a pandemic threat, terrorist attacks, and temporary closed facility; OPM has the right to add alterative facilities or change requirements to the contract that will accommodate OPMs mission. The contractor will be notified of the situation along with changes in requirements. THE CHANGE IN LOCATION SHOULD NOT HALT CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS.

To receive an award resulting from this solicitation, offerors MUST be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database IAW FAR 52.212-1(k) and DFARS 204.1104. Registration may be done on line at: www.ccr.gov.

Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the contracting officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity?s Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the contracting officer).

Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute. 
(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel ( see DLA Directive 5145.1).
