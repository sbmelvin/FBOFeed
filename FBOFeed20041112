<CONTACT>David Hess, Contracting Officer, 630 252-2677, david.hess@ch.doe.gov;John Motz, Contract Specialist, 630-252-2152, john.motz@ch.doe.gov
<DESC>The Chicago Office of the Department of Energy (DOE), in support of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), plans to contract with COGEMA, Inc., currently located at 4800 Hampden Lane, Suite 1100, Bethesda, MD 20814, to: 1) transfer certain rights of use of COGEMA S.A. proprietary intellectual property related to the design of the US MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) for use by the Russian Federation in designing and constructing the Russian MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility (R-MFFF);and 2) provide limited technical support to facilitate the design transfer to the Russian Federation. The NNSA Fissile Material Disposition Program, in accordance with the DOE Record of Decision dated April 24, 2003, and as published in the Federal Register (68FR20134), intends to dispose of 34 metric tons of U.S. surplus, weapons-grade plutonium in a safe manner.  Mixed Oxide (plutonium and uranium oxide) nuclear fuel assemblies that will be manufactured at the MFFF will be irradiated in commercial light-water reactors.  As a result, the material will be transformed to the spent fuel standard, making the plutonium as difficult to recover and as unattractive for use in weapons as the plutonium in existing commercial spent fuel.  The Department of Energy awarded a contract on March 22, 1999 to Duke COGEMA Stone & Webster, LLC, currently located at 128 South Tryon Street, Charlotte, NC 28202 for both fuel fabrication and reactor irradiation services.  Under that contract, DCS has been developing the design for the domestic U.S. MFFF, including managerial and technical integration of all the required contract activities. The selection of DCS for the contract to design the domestic U.S. facility was the result of a competitive selection process.  The resulting contract included the application of certain limited rights data, owned by COGEMA S.A., the parent of Cogema, Inc., a DCS LLC member company.  The DCS design of the domestic U.S. MFFF is in the final phases that will lead to the submission of the license application for operation to the NRC by the spring of 2005.  In December 2002, the Russian Federation agreed to use the DCS design in implementing the Russian Federation‚Äôs disposition program, to be reviewed and adapted as necessary in light of Russian legislation and standards, rules, and requirements applicable to similar facilities. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations 6.302-1, ‚ÄúOnly one responsible source and no other supplies/services will satisfy agency requirements,‚Äù it has been determined that Cogema Inc., a member company of DCS, is the only contractor that possesses the requisite proprietary data rights to transfer the current domestic MFFF design to the extent practicable and provide technical and regulatory assistance to the Russian Federation in the adaptation of that design for use in Russia.  The current domestic MFFF design incorporates commercially proven COGEMA S.A. limited rights data that are central to the successful design, construction, start-up, and operation of a Russian MFFF.  These data are necessary to replicate and utilize the domestic MFFF design.  Therefore, this contract will be negotiated on a sole source basis with COGEMA Inc.  It is anticipated that a performance-based cost-type contract for the transfer of proprietary MFFF design data to DOE and limited technical/advisory services in support of design translation to Russian will be awarded.  The anticipated period of performance is from January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2006.  Performance will take place primarily in Charlotte, NC, France, and the Russian Federation. Though this contract will be negotiated on a sole source basis with COGEMA, Inc., all responsible sources who believe they can perform the efforts described herein may submit a proposal detailing their capabilities that will be considered by the agency.  Such capability statements may be faxed to Mr. John Motz - DOE-Chicago at fax number (630) 252-5045.  See Numbered Note 22.

<SOLNBR>DTNH2-03-R-05013
<RESPDATE>040403
<CONTACT>Joseph Comella, Contracting Officer , Phone (202) 366-9568, Fax (202) 366-9555, Email jcomella@nhtsa.dot.gov
<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is soliciting proposals to support the teleprocessing needs of the National Driver Register (NDR) program. The NDR serves as a national clearinghouse for problem driver reporting. States provide the NDR with information and then access the system when drivers apply for licenses or renew them. In support of its functions, NDR requires a timesharing vendor offering an IBM compatible mainframe service capable of connecting to state hosts via AAMVAnet, the network of the American association of Motor Vehicle Administrators. 

The NDR capability is predicated on an IBM z/OS system (currently version 1 release 2) with ACP/NCP, and RACF (or similar security) providing TSO and supporting IBM's CICS Transaction Server for OS/390 version 1 release 3 (See Section C.2.3.2).  The COBOL for OS/390 compiler is used to compile programs (batch and CICS).  The NDR does not intend to consider any alternative environments and, furthermore, requires support from a vendor who has at least one year's operating experience with TS 1.3 or newer release on the proposed system by the proposal due date.  This approach will facilitate the transition from the current timesharing environment to the new one.  

The NDR's current support is based on the use of an IBM 7060-H70 multiprise mainframe with two 100 MIP engines running under the z/OS, version 1 release 2, operating system.  An identical, equivalent, or faster mainframe that supports hardware data compression is required.  The vendor's mainframe must support NDR's estimated  processing requirements as specified in Section C. and it must also be able to support NDR's response time requirements (see Section C.4.4).

This requirement is to support the National Driver Register's data processing and communications needs.  All of the NDR's technical and general support requirements for data processing and telecommunications network management as defined in the solicitation number DTNH22-03-R-05013 must be met.  
The Government contemplates awarding a firm fixed price type contract for a base period of three years with four one-year option periods. The Government plans to issue an open competitive solicitation under the NAIC Code 514210 (data processing services). Award will be made to a single offeror whose proposal is technically acceptable and offers the best value to the Government. Evaluation of offers will be done in multiple stages: technical responsiveness (mandatory requirement and migration plan); corporate capability (client satisfaction, experience, personnel, disaster recovery); system and software benchmarking, and system life cycle costs.

This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited. The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet. These documents will reside on a World-Wide Web  (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the FedBizOpps page is www.fedbizopps.gov or  www.eps.gov . It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments  (if any). Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any). A draft of NDR requirements was previously issued for industry comments under reference number NTS-10-2-05927. Offerors should base their proposals in response to this current solicitation.

All responsible sources may submit an offer that shall be considered. Requests and communications  (written or electronic) concerning this requirement must reference solicitation number DTNH22-03-R-05013. The solicitation is estimated to be issued on or about December 3, 2002.

<DESC>For the past 2 years, increasing numbers of States (i.e., the U.S. States, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories hereinafter collectively referred to as the "States") have been implementing the Click It or Ticket high visibility enforcement model which has resulted in increases in safety belt use rates.  This model uses a combination of high visibility enforcement coupled with paid media.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has proven that this is a potent combination that works to increase safety belt use and the Agency wants to provide the technical assistance to the States to continue to conduct this proven combination of strategies to increase safety belt use and decrease impaired driving.   Accordingly, NHTSA intends to issue a competitive Request For Proposal (RFP) on or about January 15, 2003, to solicit proposals from prospective offerors to provide direct technical assistance and consultation to State Highway Safety Offices and their public/media relations staff or contractors to help plan and implement communications campaigns - including purchased advertising in broadcast or print media - in support of the States' high visibility safety belt and/or impaired driving enforcement mobilizations.  Additionally, the prospective offeror shall be required to provide training, strategy development guidance and assistance with media events to selected States to help them plan, produce, and implement communications campaigns that support their intensified enforcement efforts for the Click It or Ticket and You Drink & Drive, You Lose campaigns.  NHTSA anticipates that most or all of the technical assistance will be in support of four safety belt and impaired driving mobilization efforts.  However, periodically, additional unforeseen technical assistance needs in support of these campaigns may occur.  In these instances, at NHTSA's discretion, the scope of work of this RFP, and any resultant Contract, shall be expanded to allow the prospective offeror to develop a plan and budget in support of these additional efforts.  NHTSA contemplates awarding an Indefinite Quantity, with fixed labor hour rates, Contract type for this effort, with an anticipated period of performance of a Base Period of thirty-six (36) months, with two twelve-month option periods.  The total period of performance (i.e., base and option periods) shall not exceed sixty (60) months.  At the release of the solicitation on or about January 15, 2003, the RFP, its amendments (if any), and related documents will become available over the Internet.  These documents shall reside on a World-Wide Web ("www") server, which may be accessed using a www browser application. The Internet site, or URL, for the FedBizOpps web page is www.fedbizopps.gov or www.eps.gov.  It is the prospective offerors' responsibility to monitor the referenced Internet site for the release of this solicitation; its amendments, if any; and any other related documents.  Further, prospective offerors also have the responsibility for downloading their respective copies of the RFP, its amendments (if any), and any other related documents.

<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) intends to issue a competitive Request For Proposal (RFP) for Increasing Belt Use Among Children Ages 8-15.  NHTSA collects observation data on restraint use in motor vehicles through its National Occupant Protection Use Survey (NOPUS).  NOPUS results since 1998 have shown the restraint usage rate by both infants (under age 1) and toddlers (ages 1-4) to exceed 90 percent.  However, restraint usage for older children is significantly lower.  Recorded restraint usage by children ages 8-15 was 82 percent according to the 2002 NOPUS.  And that figure only referred to the front seat.  Usage is typically lower among passengers in the back seat.  The objectives of this procurement are to determine the nature and causes of the occupant protection problem among children ages 8 through 15, and recommend strategic approaches for increasing seat belt use among that age group based on collected information.  This procurement is set-aside for 8(a) small disadvantaged business participation only.  It is intended that a fixed fee type contract will be awarded for this effort.  The anticipated period of performance for this effort is twenty-two (22) months.  The NAICS Code is 541990 for this procurement.  The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a Worldwide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the FedBizOpps page is www.fedbizopps.gov or www.eps.gov.  It is the Offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential Offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Requests for paper copies of RFP will not be accepted.  The anticipated date for the release of the RFP is on or before June 25, 2003.

<SUBJECT>10 -- SOF Combat Support Rifle (SCAR)
<SOLNBR>H92222-04-R-0001
<RESPDATE>061904
<CONTACT>Susan Griffin, Contracting Officer, Phone 813-828-7411, Fax 813-828-7504, Email griffi1@socom.mil - Susan Griffin, Contracting Officer, Phone 813-828-7411, Fax 813-828-7504, Email griffi1@socom.mil
<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command is issuing a solicitation for the procurement of SOF Combat Assault Rifles (SCAR).   The program will use full and open competition to fulfill the joint USSOCOM SCAR requirement.  The SCAR will be developed in two threshold configurations, a SCAR-Light (SCAR-L, 5.56x45mm) and a SCAR-Heavy (SCAR-H, 7.62x51mm) with the SCAR-L being the priority.  Both the SCAR-L and H will possess the capability for barrel modularity and thus will be available in the following variants:  Standard (S), Close Quarters Combat (CQC) and Sniper Variant (SV).  The SV can be a modular enhancement or a separate weapon.  The barrel modularity can be accomplished via complete upper receiver changes or just the barrel.  The SCAR-L shall be optimized for 5.56x45mm and thus shall use an enhanced 5.56mm magazine.  The SCAR-H will provide an ìopen architectureî design to accommodate changing calibers from the standard 7.62x51mm.  The initial caliber change is projected as the 7.62x39mm.  The ergonomic and parts commonality between the SCAR-L and H shall be maximized to create a ìfamilyî of SCAR weapons.  This commonality is essential for training time reduction, enhancing mission effectiveness, and improving the SOF operatorís ingrained operational and emergency procedure autonomic responses that are critical during high stress situations.  The SCAR system will be rugged, highly reliable, controllable in full automatic fire, have no unsafe failure modes, be highly ergonomic, corrosion proof (objective)/resistant (threshold), capable of lube-less firing (objective)/minimal lube firing (threshold), and capable of being operated and maintained by a single man.   

The SCAR-L with stock collapsed or folded shall not exceed lengths of 29.9î/33.6î extended with standard barrel.  The SCAR-L shall weigh no more than 7.25 lbs unloaded.  The SCAR-H shall be collapsible or foldable to lengths not greater than similar configurations of currently available 7.62mm battle rifles (30.3î folded/40.2î extended with standard barrel).  The SCAR-H shall weigh no more than 9 lbs. 

The following are the Key Performance Parameters for the SCAR:  Adaptability, Modular/Family of Weapons, Reliability and Accuracy.

The SCAR barrels/caliber will be readily exchanged at operator level, without head space/timing adjustments, within 20 minutes, threshold (T), 5 minutes objective (O).  

The SCAR-L and H, in threshold caliber configurations (5.56mm NATO and 7.62mm NATO) with M855 and M80 ball ammunition respectively (T), spirally developed/alternate caliber configurations (O), shall have a Mean Round Between Stoppages (MRBS) of 2,000 rounds (T), 8,000 rounds (O).   

The SCAR-L and H, in threshold caliber configurations (T), spirally developed/ alternate caliber configurations (O), shall have a Mean Round Between Failure (MRBF) of 15,000 rounds (T), 35,000 rounds (O). 

The SCAR-L and H, in threshold caliber configuration/ball ammunition (T), spirally developed/alternate caliber configurations (O), will have a fully functional service life without overhaul for a minimum of 15,000 rounds (T), 90,000 rounds (O) for the weapon and 15,000 rounds (T), 35,000 rounds (O) for the barrel.

The SCAR, in threshold configuration (T) and all caliber/barrel configurations (O), will not add more than 1.0 MOA at 300 meters (T), .25 MOA at 300 meters (O) to baseline (M855, MK262, M80, M118) ammunition performance

The SCAR shall also be compatible with the SOPMOD Accessory Kit components via MIL-STD 1913 rails.  It is envisioned that the SCAR weapons will be available with a sling, bipod, forward handgrip, blank firing capability and an operatorís manual.

Offerors will be required to provide product sample SCAR-Ls as part of the proposal.  The product samples will consist of 3 each SCAR-L rifles with standard barrels, 1 each CQC conversion and a SCAR-H technical approach.  After evaluation, the government will have the flexibility to award ìmultipleî contracts for follow-on test/evaluation quantities.  The contract type will be an eight-year, Firm-Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ).  The minimum quantity is projected to be 12 each SCAR-L Engineering Test Units with standard length barrels, 6 SCAR-L CQC conversions, 1 each SCAR-L Sniper Variant and 1 each SCAR-H standard.  The government will conduct an evaluation of the test units that may result in subsequent delivery orders for the SCAR family of weapons.  The contract(s) minimum quantities are delineated above.  The contract(s) maximums are 84,000 SCAR-L Standard; 28,000 SCAR-L CQC conversions; 12,000 SCAR-L SV; 15,000 SCAR-H Standard; 7,000 SCAR-H CQC conversions; and 12,000 SCAR-H SV.  The contract will contain a Provisioning Item Order (PIO) contract line item number (CLIN) of $10,000,000 for both the SCAR-L and SCAR-H.  The contract will also contain a CLIN for Engineering Services for product improvement/caliber modularity development for a not to exceed amount of $4,000,000.  The contract will also contain CLINs for magazines and tool and gage kits for both the SCAR-L and SCAR-H.  The contract will also have provisions for ordering technical data.  The contract is F.O.B. Destination (NAVSEA Crane - Crane IN).  For the minimum quantities delineated above the delivery is required 180 days after order.  Subsequent deliveries of the SCAR-L will require deliveries to commence 90 days after order.  The delivery schedule for the SCAR-H is 180 days after order for the first deliveries and once in production will be 90 days after order.  The ordering parameters (quantities) for all SCAR variants and magazines are a minimum quantity of 10/ea and a maximum quantity of 20,000/ea. The maximum monthly delivery rate is 2,000/ea for the SCAR L weapon type and 500 per month for the SCAR H weapon type.  The solicitation will require delivery of 3/ea SCAR-L (5.56x45mm) product samples; 1/ea SCAR-L CQC conversion and a SCAR-H approach included in the concise technical proposal by the closing date of the proposal.  The solicitation will be evaluated on a best value basis and the Government will reserve the right to award to other than the lowest priced offeror and other than the highest technically rated offeror.  The SCAR L product samples are not required to meet the specification in its entirety.  The technical proposal shall address any differences between the product samples and the production units; must address any known deficiencies where the product samples do not meet the specification; and shall have a separate section addressing the vendorís SCAR-H approach.  The Government cannot guarantee the condition of the product samples after testing.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  All offerors are responsible for monitoring the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://fedbizopps.gov/ for release of the upcoming solicitation and any notices.  Any questions may be directed in writing, to the following: pfender_j@crane.navy.mil or via facsimile to the attention of Mr. John Pfender at (812) 854-5198.

DMW Marine, LLC is the only licensed authorized distributor of the Palfinger Marine CranePower PKM14080MA knuckle boom cranes in the United States of America. The minimum requirements for the cranes are: have a lifting capacity of 1380-1450kg at maximum reach, 8.plus meters extended reach, and a slewing angle of 420 degrees.

The PSC crane foundation is shown in NSWC-PC Drawing 07070-37028 which is available for viewing at http://www.ncsc.navy.mil/Contracts/ZTables/syntable.htm. Use of any other crane would require major modifications being made to the manufacturers crane base or would require modifications to the boat. Delivery and installation is required no later than 60 days after contract award to support planned testing by NSWC-PC. Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City Beach, FL 32407-7! 018.  NAICS Code 423810 applies. FSC code is 3950.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  The Navy plans to upgrade one of their submarine Periscopes to incorporate an infrared imaging capability. The Navy has both 8B Mod 3 (36 ft.) and 8J Mod 3 (45 ft.) Periscope Masts in the fleet that now require conversion to the Mod 4 configuration to support an infrared module. Production drawings are available for the 8B Mod 3 (36 ft.), 8K Mod 4 (34 ft.) and 8J Mod 3 (45 ft) to support both conversions and builds. The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport anticipates acquiring on a Firm Fixed Price basis the conversion of up to six (6) Type 8B Mod 3 Masts to Type 8K Mod 4 Visual Masts and the build of one (1) Type 8K Mod 4 Visual Mast.  A line item for the installation of ìguide shoesî will used for those conversion units that are not presently in that configuration. The basic requirement also contains line items for Data, Provisioned Item Ordering and Monthly Production Progress Reports.  Options are anticipated to require the build of two (2) 8B Mod 3 Masts; conversion of up to a total of forty-two (42) 8B Mod 3 to 8K Mod 4 Visual Masts; build of up to fourteen (14) 8K Mod 4 Visual Masts; build of up to four (4) 43 foot optical length 8 Mod 4 Visual Masts and fabrication of one (1) lot of Visual Mast Conversion Spares.  The Navy plans to integrate the Masts with the Infrared Sensor, Operator Viewer and ancillary units to form the Type 8 Mod 4 Periscope Set for all SSN and SSGN Class submarines.  Evaluation factors include Technical/Management Approach, Past Performance, Personnel, Facilities and Price.  Contract award will be made on the basis of Best Value to the government.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered.  Our department no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form.  Instead, they may be accessed at our web site http://www.npt.nuwc.navy.mil/contract/.  We also provide electronic access in our Bid Room.

<DESC>Contractors provide air tanker aircraft to the USDA Forest Service (FS) that are fully operational and drop approved fire suppressant/retardant material on forest and range fires over all types of terrain.  These aircraft are operated continuously at low levels (typically 150 feet AGL) in steep mountainous terrain, and are subjected to highly turbulent environments and increased accelerations relative to the role for which the aircraft were designed.  A Structural Health Monitoring System (SHMS) designed by Systems & Electronics, Inc. of Elk Grove Village, Illinois, has been installed on part of the air tanker fleet, as well as the resulting data being evaluated.  The monitoring system is part of an on-going project to verify the airworthiness and structural life limits of the aging air tanker fleet.  The equipment used for data collection and the data gathered by that equipment must be uniform in content and format to be compatible with the existing SHMS in order to provide reliable, consistent, and accurate structural data analysis for the entire fleet throughout future years.  In order to maintain monitoring system compatibility and data reliability, the FS intends to acquire on a sole-source basis from Systems & Electronics, Inc., the installation of SHMSís into the remaining seven (7) Aero Union P-3 Air Tankers, and the data processing of recorded flight data from one DC-7 Air Tanker and eight (8) P-3 air Tankers for a one-year period.  
Any offeror interested in submitting a technical proposal in response to this notice is invited to do so.  Proposals shall provide a complete explanation of how their proposed structural monitoring equipment and data collection and reporting capability is currently compatible in every way with the existing installed SHMS from Systems & Electronics, Inc.  Past performance information relative to the installation and evaluation of data from the proposed system is also required.  Please note that proposals received as a result of this notice will be considered only for the purpose of determining whether the proposed system is compatible and uniform to the Systems & Electronics, Inc. SHMS, and if so, whether or not it is possible to obtain an equivalent system through competitive processes.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Applications (RFA) on or about 11/30/2004, for the anticipated award of a Cooperative Agreement to support USAID/Colombiaís Strategic Objective No. 2, Promote Economic and Social Alternatives to Illicit Production, under the Colombia Alternative Development Program (USAID/Colombia/CAD).  USAID funding for this effort will be at an estimated ceiling of $2,500,000.

Strategies are sought to assist the Integrated Sustainable Development involving indigenous groups in National Parks Buffer Zones in Colombia.  Among the objectives of the program are to achieve effective management of the National Parks buffer zones (zonas de amortiguacion), support sustainable productive activities in these areas, and achieve organizational strengthening of local indigenous communities.  The primary means by which these requirements may be met, in achieving a sustainable development in buffer zones, is through an integrated development approach that focuses on, but is not exclusively limited to, areas that are carefully selected around the following National Parks:  namely The Sierra Nevada National Park (Cesar, Magdalena and Guajira), The Purace (Huila and Cauca) NP, and the Alto Fragua (Caqueta).  The development programs should consider and carry out the following types of activities: 

ï	Institutional/association development with a focus on indigenous communities (i.e., strengthen and consolidate organizational processes for project management; strengthen indigenous cabildo territorial councils)
ï	Implementation of income-generating productive activities (i.e., eco-tourism, artisan products, coffee, cacao, agro-forestry, rubberÖ)
ï	Development of social and human capital
ï	Development of local capacity building for the management of natural resources in buffer zones and within protected areas.
ï	Provide indigenous communities around the natural protected areas with new skills that promote an understanding of the management of buffer zones in which they live.
ï	Support indigenous community investments in productive activities (i.e., capacity to mobilize resources from public and private sources at national, regional, and local levels)
ï	Strengthen biocultural conservation initiatives
ï	Support the consolidation and organizational strengthening of indigenous groups
ï	Support/strengthen socio-economic dimensions of conservation in buffer zones including land tenure and titling, livelihoods, population migration, gender issues and appropriate stakeholder engagement.
ï	Develop local community participation, education and communication

Consistent with USAID/Colombia Mission priorities, the program will give priority to those geographic areas that are actively confronting illegal drug cultivation and narco-trafficking.  Coca production usually occurs in buffer zones with intrusions in National Parks, as well.  If illicit crops are to be eradicated or voluntarily substituted by licit crops, it is only natural that other productive activities for the land to be considered as viable long-term economic alternatives in these areas. Alternative economic development options in the buffer zones should be restricted to technically and sustainably appropriate productive activities such as agroforestry, coffee, cacao production, processing, and marketing.

Colombia is among the countries considered ìmegadiverseî, both biologically and culturally.  Among the factors contributing to this diversity are its geographic location within the tropical zone, the presence of the Andes mountain range, and the influence of two oceans.  Based on the number of species found within its borders, Colombia ranks worldwide as first in the diversity of birds, second in amphibians, second in flowering plants, third in reptiles, and fourth in mammals.  Colombia encompasses 10 percent of the worldís biodiversity. 

Culturally, Colombia recognizes 84 indigenous groups, with an estimated total population of 800,000, who inhabit lands characterized with the greatest biodiversity.  In most instances, these traditional indigenous groups possess social organizations and living patterns that revolve around the use of natural resources, and therefore are directly affected by the existing management and conservation practices of Colombiaís unique environment.  The program should seek to strengthen existing agreements with indigenous communities that promote shared resource management and support efforts leading to new agreements, as appropriate.

<DESC>ENHANCED GRENADE LAUNCHER MODULE

Note: this announcement supplements the previous announcement H92222-04-R-0001 for the SCAR to ADD the EGLM requirements to the SCAR solicitation.

The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) anticipates revising the SOF Combat Assault Rifle (SCAR) synopsis/solicitation H92222-04-R-0001 to include the Enhanced Grenade Launcher Module (EGLM) system.  The EGLM will become part of the SCAR weapon system.  The EGLM was originally synopsized by USSOCOM on January 6, 2004 under RFP number H92222-04-R-0013.   The EGLM shall be a single shot, 40mm grenade launcher module that will interface with the SCAR Light (5.56mm) and the SCAR Heavy (7.62mm) assault rifles and shall also possess a stand-alone capability.  The EGLM weapon system consists of a 40mm weapon/grenade launcher, fire control and a stand-alone butt-stock assembly.  The EGLM system shall have a fire control system providing day and night targeting and range finding capabilities.  The EGLM design shall not limit the overall length of the round.  The EGLM shall be interoperable with the current family of U.S. munitions, and SCAR L/H.  The EGLM should be compatible with USSOCOM SOPMOD equipment.  The EGLM shall not pose a safety hazard to the operator or nearby personnel, during handling, transport, storage or use.   The EGLM shall incorporate a manual safety device with an integrated safe/fire switch with positive stops.  The EGLM system shall provide a method of target ranging that allows operators to determine range to 600 meters, with error not to exceed ±1m, during day, night, and limited visibility.  The EGLM system, for area targets, shall achieve 8 out of 10 hits at unknown distances to 200 meters on a designated target and 6 out of 10 hits at unknown distances from 201 meters to 300 meters on a designated target.  For point targets, the EGLM shall achieve 8 out of 10 hits on a 36-inch by 36-inch upright target at 100 meters.  The EGLM system shall allow the operator the capability of installing/removing the EGLM system to/from the host SCAR weapon or to/from the butt-stock assembly without the use of Special Tools.  The government will not require the SCAR product samples to include the EGLM; however, the proposal instructions will require the offeror, in the Technical Area proposal, to address the EGLM in a similar fashion as is currently required of the proposed SCAR H.    The eight-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract will contain a line item for the EGLM with a minimum quantity of 12/ea complete EGLM systems consisting of weapon, fire control and stand-alone butt-stock assembly.  The minimum quantity of 12/ ea will be identified as Engineering Test Units (ETUs) and will be required 180 days after effective date of delivery order (projected delivery date is July 2005).  The IDIQ contract maximum cumulative quantity is 21,000/ea 40mm weapon/ grenade launchers, 25,000/ea fire controls, and 25,000/ea stand-alone butt-stock assemblies.  The government is not obligated to order more than the minimum quantity.  There is a low rate initial production (LRIP) requirement for 250/ea of all three components.  The LRIP units have a required delivery of 240 days after effective date of order.  Any subsequent orders for any EGLM system component will require delivery to commence 90 days after order with a maximum monthly delivery rate of 500/ea.  Delivery terms are FOB Destination (NSWC Crane IN).  Numbered note 26 applies.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  All offerors are responsible for monitoring the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://fedbizopps.gov/ for release of the upcoming solicitation and any notices.  Any questions may be directed in writing, to the following: pfender_j@crane.navy.mil or via facsimile to the attention of Mr. John Pfender at (812) 854-5198.

<SOLNBR>NTS-10-2-05927

<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is posting a draft solicitation to the FedBizOpps Internet site (www.fedbizopps.gov ). The draft solicitation includes the statement of work, cost worksheets, evaluation criteria, instructions to offerors and partial contract sections. Written industry comments are solicited and should reference the specific solicitation section in question. Written comments should be sent via e-mail to jcomella@nhtsa.dot.gov no later than October 15, 2002. All comments received by that date will be considered, however, the Government reserves the right to issue the final solicitation, as it deems appropriate. Prospective offerors are cautioned not to rely on the information provided in the draft solicitation as being the same or similar to the information that will ultimately be issued as the formal Request for Proposal.   

This requirement is to support the National Driver Register's data processing and communications needs.  All of the NDR's technical and general support requirements for data processing and telecommunications network management as defined in the draft solicitation must be met.  The Government plans to issue a draft competitive solicitation using the SIC Code 7379 or the NAIC Code 514210 with a SBA Size Standard of $21 million.

The NDR capability is predicated on an IBM OS/390 system (currently version 2 release 10) with ACP/NCP, and RACF (or similar security) providing TSO and supporting IBM's CICS Transaction Server for OS/390 version 1 release 3 (See Section C.2.3.2).  The COBOL for OS/390 compiler is used to compile programs (batch and CICS).  The NDR does not intend to consider any alternative environments and, furthermore, requires support from a vendor who has at least one year's operating experience with TS 1.3 on the proposed system by the proposal due date.  This approach will facilitate the transition from the current timesharing environment to the new one.  

The NDR's current support is based on the use of an IBM 7060-H70 multiprise mainframe with two 100 MIP engines running under the OS/390, version 2 release 10, operating system.  An identical, equivalent, or faster mainframe that supports hardware data compression is required.  The vendor's mainframe must support NDR's estimated peak processing requirements as specified in Section C.3, Table C-2, and it must also be able to support NDR's response time requirements (see Section C.4.4).

This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited. The draft solicitation for comments and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet. These documents will reside on a WorldWide Web  (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the FedBizOpps page is www.fedbizopps.gov or  www.eps.gov . It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments  (if any). Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

The MDA/IC is a joint service activity that operates as a missile defense solutions center. The MDA/IC is operating this center equipped with computers, software tools, network and technical knowledge that provides affordable, comprehensive research and analysis products and services for MDA systems. Plans include development, integration and use of models and simulations to add value to all phases of the Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition cycle for current and future MDA systems. It is a fully integrated research and customer support capability comprised of facilities, hardware, software and information hosted at Schriever Air Force Base, Colorado. On site facilities include a Research Building and Consolidated Support Facility (CSF). In addition to the facilities at Schriever Air Force Base, the MDA/IC collaborates and is networked with research centers at locations nationwide and several associated facilities worldwide. This acquisition is being accomplished IAW FAR 15.202 Advisory Multi-Step Process and FAR Subpart 15.3 Source Selection procedures, implementing acquisition streamlining where practical. 

Current plans are to release a Draft Request For Proposal (DRFP) late November 04 followed by an unclassified Industry/Orientation Day on December 1, 2004 at the JNIC open to all interested offerors. Details regarding attendance for the Industry/Orientation Day will published at http://www.eps.gov. 

Contractors are asked to limit participation on Industry/Orientation Day to no more than three representatives per firm. The purposes of this Industry/Orientation Day Event are to (1) serve as a catalyst and encourage teaming arrangements between industry partners and (2) provide overview and mission briefing on current JNIC activities and (3) allow for potential offerors to submit questions related to the DRFP. 

An Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Task Order contract is anticipated. Task Orders will be issued as Cost Plus Award (CPAF), Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF), Firm Fixed Price (FFP) or Cost Reimbursable. Period of performance is five years (two year basic and three one-year options). Additionally, two award terms may be included in the contract. The first award term period will have a one-year base period with two one-year options, the second award term period will have a one-year base period with a one-year option, for a potential maximum contract length of ten years.  The solicitation is expected late Jan 05. Proposals are expected to be due 45 calendar days after Final Request for Proposal (FRFP) release. Contract award is scheduled for late September 2005 with a phased transition period of approximately two months leading up to assumption of all responsibilities on 1 December 2005. As this acquisition progresses, additional information such as the DRFP (H95001-04-R-0001), bidders library, FRFP will be available at website http://www.eps.gov. Only one proposal may be submitted per prime contractor. 

In the first step of this process, offerors are asked to submit a four page Statement of Capabilities (SOC) for evaluation by the Government.  Submit one hardcopy and one softcopy of the SOC in response to the Advisory Multi-Step by 1000 local time, on 7 Dec 04 to the following address: JNIC, 730 Irwin Avenue, Schriever AFB CO 80912-7300, Attn: Sandra Yaden, JRDC Contracting Officer. For the hardcopy use 8.5 by 11 inch paper, standard pagination, one-inch page margins, a 12-point font or larger and double space. Submit the softcopy in Microsoft Word 2000 compatible format on a standard IBM compatible 3.5' high-density diskette or CD. On page 1 identify the intended offeror, a list of key personnel and points of contact on your company's letterhead. The information should include e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and intended roles of each person listed. At a minimum, please include the contracting and technical points of contact. On pages 2-4 include information on the following evaluation categories:

(1) experience and/or capabilities for recruiting, training and retaining highly qualified workforce with technical and military operational experience vital to missile defense test and analysis; (2) experience and/or capabilities to manage, operate and maintain large computers and communication networking systems; (3) experience and/or capabilities working with the United States space or missile defense community; (4) experience and/or capabilities in modeling and simulation, test and evaluation, and analysis; and (5) experience in managing large, complex integrated service contracts. 

Each of the preceding experience and/or capability will be evaluated and rated as either likely viable or likely unviable based on the following criteria: (1) Likely Viable - The potential offeror's submitted information generally meets most of the requirements of the evaluation categories for the SOC.   The information submitted directly addresses the above criteria, but may contain certain elements of risk. (2) Likely Unviable - The potential offeror's submitted information that does not generally meet most of the requirements of the evaluation categories for the SOC.    The government will advise potential offerors whether or not they appear to be viable competitors.  Viable competitors will be invited to compete on the FRFP, which will include detailed requirements to submit past performance information, formal pricing information, and a detailed technical proposal. Firms who are advised that they do not appear to be viable competitors will not be invited to submit proposals; however, they will not be precluded from competing on the FRFP.  One-on one discussions will be held with competitors submitting a SOC.  In order to encourage teaming arrangements, the government intends to publish the list of viable prime contractors along with the contracting and technical points of contact and their respective e-mail addresses. Nothing submitted with the SOC or in response to this synopsis will be used for evaluation purposes once the FRFP is released. This acquisition will use full and open competition. 

This invitation to participate in the on-site Industry/Orientation Day and Advisory Multi-Step process does not constitute a request for proposal. The information presented herein will not obligate the government in any manner.  The government will not reimburse the attendees for any costs associated with participation at the Industry/Orientation Day or SOC preparation and delivery. All responsible sources may submit a proposal that shall be considered. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute a Request For proposal (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.

<DESC>The Test, Evaluation and Specialized Contracts division is planning to procure services that will allow the modification of the GEMACS and CEM Framework to accommodate numerous facet modeling elements.  The Air Force SEEK EAGLE Officeís (AFSEO) currently has Computerize Physical Fit (CPF) models that interface with ìGEMACSî (General Electromagnetic Model for the Analysis of Complex Systems), the AFSEOís primary code for Computational Electromagnetics (CEM), via facet files generated by the AFSEO in the CPF process.  The faceted files are visualized and communicated to GEMACS through the proprietary code ìCEM Frameworkî, a computational electromagnetic software environment developed through a Small Business Innovation Research effort.  To realize the increased modeling and simulation potential afforded by CPF models, this effort will require making modifications and upgrades to GEMACS in two areas: 1) overcoming the ìinternal resonanceî problem that occurs for the electrically large geometries now made possible by the CPF-GEMACS integration, and; 2) efficient and timely solution of large matrix problems generated by the GEMACS physics.  Interested parties may submit Statement of Capabilities (SOC) demonstrating their ability to perform the required effort.  All responses to this synopsis will be evaluated in the following areas:  1) Demonstrated technical knowledge of the AFSEOís electromagnetic certification process; 2) Demonstrated technical knowledge in state of the art computational electromagnet methods; 3) Ability to modify the GEMACS code while maintaining its core capabilities; 4) Ability to modify the CEM Framework software environment while maintaining its core capabilities; 5) Ability to perform acceptance tests of the new capabilities in accordance with Contractor developed and Government approved plans; 6) Ability to maintain the integrity of all software through Government approved software configuration control methods, and avoiding unnecessary redevelopment efforts; and  7) Ability to meet the required delivery schedule.  Responders to this synopsis will not be provided the results of the government evaluation of their qualifying package.  The effort is planned to begin approximately 3 Jan 2005.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR); Aircraft Support Contracts Department (AIR 2.5.1.3), Patuxent River, MD  20670-1127 announces this sources sought as its intention to procure, on a competitive basis, under the FastTrack program, the manufacturing of aircraft components necessary for obsolescence issues in support of the Aging Aircraft Integrated Product Team (AAIPT) (AIR 4.1D).  This FastTrack procurement would support NAVAIRís need for re-engineering, non-recurring engineering (NRE), prototype manufacturing, first article testing, and production requirements of aircraft and aircraft parts facing obsolescence issues in a timely manner in order to support and maintain fleet readiness.  Additionally, the FastTrack program would support these needs throughout the Department of Defense (DoD) and any applicable outside agencies.  The charter of the AAIPT is to identify, investigate, and implement programs that will field products to improve the availability and affordability of the fleetís aging aeronautical systems.  One aspect involves coordination with multiple competencies, Program Offices, and Naval Inventory Control Point (NAVICP) to focus on urgently required parts needed across the NAVAIR spectrum of aging aircraft.  The government will identify component problems, quantify the costs/risks associated with each problem, and provide information, products and solutions to the NAVAIR FastTrack team for implementation.    THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  It is a market research tool being used to determine potential, eligible, and interested businesses (both large and small), capable of providing these services and products prior to determining the method of acquisition prior to issuance of a Request for Proposal(RFP). The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis. 

INTRODUCTION
Declining budgets have forced military services to acquire new weapons replacement assemblies/sub-system assemblies at less than traditional rates.  This environment has caused an increasing reliance on aging weapons systems in inventory to meet both current and projected operational requirements well into the 21st Century.  This reliance on aging systems has in turn, caused an increasing containment issue to the fighting forces and the supporting logistical support systems. 

Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and their suppliers are either no longer in business, decline to produce, or are incapable of producing older parts for DoD.  During original acquisitions, the DoD services did not acquire reprocurement technical data packages.  More importantly, components that were not originally provisioned, are now failing.
  
REQUIREMENT
The proposed contract will cover a period of five years comprised of one base year and four one-year options.  The total estimated dollar value for this procurement is roughly estimated to be between $450,000,000.00 and $700,000,000.00.  The applicable NAICS Code for this requirement is 336411.

The anticipated effort under the proposed contract includes, but is not limited to the following:

The contractor may be required to provide a full range of comprehensive system engineering, technical assistance, and materials that are necessary for engineering, reverse engineering, technical requirements, system analyses, qualification testing, subsystem integration and maintenance support required to sustain aging weapons systems.  Spare parts such as line replacement units (LRUs), shop replacement units (SRUs), depot replacement units, and structural components required to repair weapon systems and their major subsystems are scarce.  Additionally, the proposed procurement is intended to provide a vehicle for Joint Service Support to address these types of problems. This initiative includes technology insertion, engineering analysis, re-design, reverse engineering, rapid prototyping, repair, fabrication, testing, and calibration. Programs requiring this type of sustainment support will include, but are not limited to Joint Service Support, Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corp major weapon systems, subsystems and spare parts components.

The above effort may require the contractor to repair, modify and test various types of systems, subsystems and ground support equipment. The contractor may also be tasked to perform hardware/software engineering, troubleshoot subsystems, perform quality assurance support, provide configuration management and prepare logistics support for systems, subsystems, and test-beds.  This support will also include a full spectrum of engineering and manufacturing capability to reverse/re-engineer, produce and support the management of out-of-production or inordinately high cost system/subsystems or components to extend the life cycle of aging fleets.  

PROCESS
FastTrack support will be accomplished by using available competitive resources from the private and public support sector, and utilizing test capabilities already established at Patuxent River NAS.  

The FastTrack process is as follows:  
1.  Identify problem component
2.  Establish a Navy evaluation team.
3.  Navy team evaluates candidate item.
4.  A Technical data package is developed for candidate item.  
5.  Solicit capable vendors.
6.  Evaluate proposals, based on Best Value.

Interested firms should provide a brief summary of the following information for evaluation:
1.  Past experience in the above areas with particular emphasis on work performed for DoD/NAVAIR/NAWCAD/NAVICP/DLA in providing support services for Aging Aircraft and obsolete piece part issues.
2.  Familiarization with DOD Critical Item Management Processes (formerly the DOD Alternate Source Qualification Process).
3.  Personnel Resources/Facilities Capabilities including staff qualifications and experience with information technology tools as it relates to manufacturing NAVAIR Critical Safety Items (CSI) and Critical Application Items (CAI).
4.  Past performance on projects requiring reverse engineering and resolution of obsolescence issues.

Responses can be delivered in person and should not exceed five pages total.

Contractor personnel working in the electronic systems field may be required to have a security clearance at the level required for each specific order/technical direction letter (TDL), i.e.:  Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret.  Personal clearance levels must be obtained for the appropriate program being supported.  The contractor shall comply with specific site access requirements.  The contractor shall protect all proprietary data from unauthorized use or disclosure so long as it remains proprietary and the contractor shall refrain from using the information for any other purpose other than that for which it was furnished.

The Government anticipates release of the electronic RFP on/or about 01 April 2005 with an anticipated closing date of 01 June 2005.  The proposed contract award date is on/or about 10 October 2005.  There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties in support of the effort mentioned above.

<SUBJECT>A -- Proposers Day Announcement - Integrated Battle Command
<DESC>DARPA will host a Proposers Day Conference in support of the Integrated Battle Command (IBC) program on 15 December 2004 at Hilton Arlington & Towers: 950 North Stafford Street, Arlington, VA 22203 beginning at 8:00am and lasting until 4:30pm. The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the Integrated Battle Command program; promote additional discussion on this topic; address questions from potential proposers; and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.  Questions from attendees at the Proposersí Day may be used to shape any subsequent BAA.  It is anticipated that a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the program will be released after the conference.  Attendance at this Proposersí Day is voluntary.  Attendance is not required to propose to any subsequent BAA.   

The Integrated Battle Command program will develop transformational technologies to enhance the capability of commanders and staffs to plan and conduct future campaigns by integrating joint, effects-based operations. The objective of the program is a prototype Commanderís Automated Decision Support System, which will consist of a suite of software tools that enable the creation of command-specific, customized, decision support capabilities by the ad hoc implementation and on-the-fly confederation of individual software tool components. This will provide a transformational capability to conduct the unpredictable campaigns of the future.

These ìdecision aidsî will apply over the full continuum of near-simultaneous missions required in a campaign including major combat operations and various security, stability and reconstruction operations. The goal of IBC is to deliver automated tools to assist the commander and staff in areas such as: 
ï	understanding and visualizing the current and forecast battlespace, 
ï	generating and assessing the consequences of political, military (air, land and sea), economic, social, information operations, and infrastructure (PMESII) effects, 
ï	constructing and evaluating plans that are based on the impact of multi-dimensional effects and the interaction among effects, and, 
ï	collaborating with superiors and subordinates in a coalition environment. 

DARPA envisions a technical approach based on three innovative technologies:

ï	Tool-Making-Tool Kit: a radically new class of decision support and planning tool technologies, with user friendly interfaces, that enable the users (not computer scientists) to create complex planning systems, decision aids, collaboration aids, simulations, etc. that are tailored to a particular military campaign on-the-fly as the campaign unfolds. This is a paradigm shift based on the commercial model for developing software products. 
ï	Software Confederation Web: a radically new class of software-integration-web technology to enable the ad hoc, on-the-fly confederation of large ensembles of software components, when and, as they are needed.  This is a paradigm shift for creating large software systems by way of a self-forming system of systems
ï	Interaction Manager: an intelligent user interface that manages the interaction between humans and computers (two-way) and between heterogeneous ensembles of planning tools, decision aids, simulations, information and knowledge sources as well as other software components.  This is a paradigm shift to allow the computer to model and adapt to the humanís objectives rather than just having the human understand the computerís data.

The first phase of the program will focus on the core capability and a tool-making-tool kit to assist in predicting and analyzing PMESII effects as a function of various diplomatic, information, military, or economic (DIME) actions.

REGISTRATION INFORMATION
Please send an e-mail to Canon P. Sobay (csobay@snap.org), Phone:  (703)522-5123, no later than 9 December 2004 if you plan to attend.

A DARPA Form 60 will be sent to those who identify that they are not US citizens in their registration e-mail.  

The Proposersí Day will be unclassified and open to all potential bidders. The IBC program may be subject to U.S. Export Controls (International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)) and National Security regulations. All performers must meet the requirements for participation set by those regulations.  The Proposersí Day is voluntary.  Attendance is not required to propose to this BAA.  Proposersí Day conference fee is $75.  This information will also be available through the IBC website:  http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/IBC/index.htm.

Additionally, attendees who would like to share information at the conference may bring posters to display outside of the conference room.  The poster session, will allow interested parties to meet with you and discuss your capabilities and innovations related to this topic.  If you plan to bring a poster, please notify Canon P. Sobay when you register for the Proposersí Day Conference. Attendees who bring posters should bring in their own easels.
 
All material to be displayed at the conference must be approved in advance by both the organization that funded the research and the DARPA Program Manager.  The DARPA Program Manager will screen the proposed material for sensitive, but unclassified material and approve in advance any presentations.  It is the presenterís responsibility to ensure that all material they plan to present at the IBC Proposersí Day Conference has been approved by the funding organization in advance. The IBC Proposersí Day Conference will be open to the public.  An electronic copy of all material to be presented must be provided to the DARPA Program Manager for review by December 3, 2004.  There will be no exceptions to this requirement.  NOTE:  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTING OFFICER BELOW WITH RESPECT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, BUT INSTEAD DIRECT ALL INQUIRIES AS STIPULATED HEREIN.

Any delay caused by contractor's inability to place commodities in a F.o.b. Origin or f.a.s. Vessel, Port of Shipment position, which results in conveyance or vessel claim for detention or dead freight, will be for the account of the contractor.   Any claims for detention or dead freight will be settled between the contractor and conveyance owners.

The carrier will have four (4) working days to inspect, accept or reject the commodity as contracted, giving reasons in writing for any rejections. The commodity parcels rejected shall be identified to the warehouse contractor and to USAID. Cargoes rejected by the carrier will be subject to inspection by FGIS to determine final disposition.

<DESC>The following questions have been received, the Coast Guard would like to provide the following clarification:   

1.   Solicitation:  Will the Coast Guard furnish any electrical power on the pier adjacent to the
 vessel for contractorsí use during this availability?

Answer:  Contractor shall provide all power. 

2.  Solicitation:  Section 52.252-2 ìClauses Incorporated by Reference (FEB 1998):
The Contractor notices that the ìProgress Payment FAR Clauseî is not included in
this section.  Due to the length of this contract, forty seven (47) calendar days, will the
Coast Guard add the ìProgress Payment FAR Clauseî to this solicitation?

Answer:  Progress payments will not be utilized under this contract.  The contractor will invoice 
the Coast Guard Finanical Center at the end of the contract period. 


3.   W/I #1:	Paragraph 1.1: During this availability, the Contractor needs to know how 
the ship will be moored to the pier.    This knowledge is required in order to estimate the
size of the crane that will be required to handle all of the components during removal,
installation and testing.Will the Ship be moored Starboard Side to the pier, or will it be
moored Port Side to the pier?

Answer:  Cutter will moor starboard side 


4.    W/I #1:	Paragraph 3.7.4.4: If the Ship will be moored Starboard Side to the pier,
then breasting of the ship away from the pier maybe required during the Load Testing
identified by this paragraph. Will the Coast Guard breast the ship away from the pier 
during the Load Testing Phase, if adequate room does not exist for the MSD to traverse
from the water line to the deck?

Answer:  Ships Force will breast the ship out to allow sufficient space to perform load testing.


5.    W/I #1:	Paragraph 3.1.2: This paragraph identifies that the Motor Surf Boat (MSB)
will be interference, in way of the repairs required to be performed, under this contract.  

Upon completion of the Pre-Overhaul Operational Test required under Paragraph 3.1.1,
it is understood that the contractor must remove the MSB from the ship in order to clear
the area for repairs.  Will the Coast Guard provide the skid to place the MSB on during these
repairs, or is the Contractor to provide their own skid?

Answer:  There will be a cradle available on the pier for the MSB.
 

6.    W/I#1:	Paragraphs 3.4.7.1.4 and 3.4.7.5: These two (2) paragraphs contradict each other. 
 Paragraph 3.4.7.1.4 directs the Contractor to install a ìNEWî centrifugal brake; however paragraph
 3.4.7.5 directs the Contractor to renew only the brake linings. 
Which paragraph is the Contractor to perform in respect to the Centrifugal Brake Assembly?

Answer:  Paragraph 3.4.7.1.4 refers to the gear box assembly, and the spec has been modified for future use to
delete the centrifugal brake from this paragraph.  Renew other components of the gear box as specified 
in paragraph 3.4.7.1.4, and renew brake parts as specified in paragraph 3.4.7.5.


7.  1. PARA 3.4.7 Hoist Winch & 7.1 Gear Case Assembly. 
The spec does not say to remove the Hoist Winch from the ship. It may imply
that with some of the work you want done. I need to know if its OK to bring
the tech rep in or shall I figure on Removal of the winch from the space. 

Answer:  The specification doesn't specifically call for the removal of the winch
or hoist motor from the ship to perform any work; however if they find
it more convienient they may do so.  Keeping in mind that the spec does
call for preservation of the winch motor casing, take extreme care to not
overspray on other equipment in the space or on the pier or the water. 
Basically, if they can demonstrate that they can perform all of the work 
in the specification to the satisfaction of the CG Inspector and all applicable industry and mil-standards.

The closing date remains unchanged.

6 		Project Descriptions and Profile

The definitional mission will be expected to review and help further develop  a proposal USTDA received for the Mukono District Industrial and Municipal Wastewater Treatment Facility Project and explore other water and wastewater projects in Uganda for USTDA funding.  

USTDA received a proposal for a project from Nile Breweries Limited, a Ugandan incorporated subsidiary of the South African Breweries-Miller Group (SABMiller).  Nile Breweries is mandated to develop an industrial wastewater treatment plant to mitigate the company's own wastewater discharge into the Nile River by 2005.  The company recognizes that with limited additional resources, they could develop a plant that could also serve as a municipal wastewater treatment facility for the towns of Jinja and Njeru, Mukono District, both located close to the source of the Nile River.  There are currently no wastewater treatment facilities in Njeru, and domestic sewage is disposed of either in pit latrines, septic tanks, or directly into the river.  Jinja, approximately three miles away from Njeru, is partly served by an old and only partially working wastewater treatment facility managed by the National Water and Sewerage Corporation.  Both of the towns violate existing national statutes on standards for wastewater being discharged into surface water bodies, and have a detrimental environmental impact on the Nile at its very source.

The goal of the proposed feasibility study is to examine the technical, economic and socio-political viability of establishing a wastewater treatment complex in a suitable location, to treat both the industrial and municipal waste from both Jinja and Njeru.  The management of Nile Breweries, a company based in Jinja, is committed to building a full industrial wastewater treatment facility in the medium-term in order to meet local wastewater discharge standards, however is keen to assist in the economic development of the area, and would prefer to be part of a total, not partial solution.  This ìtotal solutionî approach would involve studying, and later implementing, the collection and treatment of the numerous small to medium discharge streams, which could be contained with little incremental cost to the existing infrastructure.  This will require other stakeholders, who are currently contributing to the pollution problem, becoming involved in the project.  These possible stakeholders include other local industries, commercial establishments, the local town councils, the Department for Water Development, the National Water and Sewerage Corporation, and the National Environmental Management Authority.  Nile Breweries is interested in using this project as a type of pilot for other SABMiller plants throughout sub-Saharan Africa.

The definitional mission consultant is expected to help develop a terms of reference for a feasibility study that will examine the various needs of the stakeholders of this potential project.  This may require holding a stakeholder meeting and meeting separately with various stakeholders.  The consultant should develop the terms of reference so that the resulting feasibility study is informative for local stakeholders and potential financiers, both technically and financially, so that the project has the best chance of moving forward and could potentially be replicated.  One of the key issues is who the "Grantee" for the project should be, and how financing would be structured.  Issues of maintenance and human capacity building for operating the plant should also be explored.

The consultant will then consider other potential projects for USTDA assistance in the water/ wastewater sectors in Uganda.  USTDA has no additional information for such projects; the definitional mission team would be required to scope the projects on the ground in Uganda.
