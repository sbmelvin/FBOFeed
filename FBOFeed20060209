The authority for this acquisition is AMS Policy 3.2.2.4:  Based on standardization and the required use of certified aircraft parts that are manufactured in accordance with the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR).   The commercial aircraft are type certificated and modified to meet special FAA mission requirements.  The aircraft are used for flight inspection and certification of Instrument Flight Rule (IFR) procedures and navigational facilities, and for supporting regulatory activities.   	The CSPS program provides certified parts necessary to maintain the FAA Learjet and Challenger FIA aircraft in airworthy condition.  Providing Bombardier certified parts expeditiously is critical to insure the FAA aircraft are airworthy and available to meet the requirements for performance of flight inspection missions.  The CSPS program has requirements to provide all necessary parts necessary for the maintenance of the aircraft excluding the unique Automated Flight Inspection System (AFIS) parts.  The parts provided by the CSPS program are proprietary to Bombardier must meet certification requirements, deliver to an FAA maintenance location in a defined time period, and be invoiced at a fixed cost per flight hour.  The fixed cost per flight hour provides the FAA an efficient method to budget the cost of the parts required to maintain an airworthy aircraft and reduce the need and cost of purchasing and storing additional inventories.  The CSPS program provides the management and control of parts, which includes ordering, stocking, issuing, core tracking, and coordination of overhaul and repair of rotable parts.  The CSPS program also includes the management and tracking of warranty and in-service programs.  The following aircraft will be covered by this document:  	Type of Aircraft	Tail Number	Serial Number 	Learjet Model 60	N-54	          60-009   	Learjet Model 60 	N-55	          60-013   	Learjet Model 60	N-56	          60-033   	Learjet Model 60 	N-57	          60-039   	Learjet Model 60	N-58	          60-057   	Learjet Model 60	N-59	          60-080   	Challenger 601-3R	N-85	          5138	 	Challenger 601-3R 	N-86	          5167	 	Challenger 601-3R	N-87	          5190	 	Challenger 604	        N-88              5588 The requirement is being processed using limitation of sources to a single source as provided for under the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Sections 3.2.2.2 and 3.2.2.4.

ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required represe!  ntations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With OR CA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID!   and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but!   at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed in formation regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help). *52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items *52.212-5,Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders within this clause, the following clauses apply; 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Vietnam Era, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, 52.222-19 Child Labor--Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, 52.225-13 Restriction on Certain Foreign Purchases, 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer --Central Contractor Registration, 52.232-18-Availability of Funds. *52.216-18 Ordering (a) Any supplies and services to be furnished under this contract shall be ordered by issuance of!   delivery orders or task orders by the individuals or activities designated in the Schedule.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) intends to negotiate with Science Applications International Corporation, 10260 Campus Point Drive, San Diego CA 92121, on a sole source basis.  The proposed Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract is to provide a twenty-four month effort for continued support at the Navy's Maritime Synthetic Range (MSR) located in the Navy's Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF).  The objective of this MSR project is to provide the ability to support Naval training exercises in the region that use live, virtual and constructive technologies for affordable training and mission rehearsal in Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Mine Warfare (MIW), and Surface Warfare (SUW) beyond PMRF to the Mid-Pacific Area of Responsibility (AOR).  General capabilities to be developed include the following:  1) Real-time participation in operational training by units pier-side, underway or deployed; 2) creation of synthetic Blue Forces and Opposition Forces to support training; 3) Scenario generation based on geographic terrain and bathymetry databases to enable realistic training and mission planning; 4) Creation of common synthetic battlespace and generation of advanced threat environments; and 5) Extension of coordinated Anti-Submarine Warfare / Under-Sea Warfare/Surface Warfare/Mine Warfare training provided by PMRF and other training facilities in the Mid-Pacific region.  The initial effort will involve a study and analysis to specifically outline the tasking needed to expand these five MSR capabilities into the entire Mid-Pacific AOR.  In performing these functions, the contractor shall maintain previously developed MSR technologies, as well as continue to develop technology solutions for MSR that support experimentation within the operational environment at PMRF and the Mid-Pacific AOR.  SAIC has been providing support to the PMRF facility since Government fiscal year 2000, resulting in unique capabilities that cannot be recovered through competition without substantial duplication of costs.  

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Numbered Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue a sole source solicitation to Innovative Defense Strategies (IDS), 3150 South Street, NW, Suite PH2A, Washington, D.C. 20007 under the authority of 10 U.S.C. (c)(1).  This procurement is for open system architecture business and technical recommendations and training materials that can facilitate and streamline the Navy’s transition to open system procurements for ship platforms.  Richard Carroll, the owner of IDS, is uniquely qualified in the area of open systems based on his past successful implementation of the Navy’s first Open Architecture (OA) engineering environment, accomplished under the Navy Submarine’s Acoustic Rapid COTS Insertion (ARCI) program.

<DESC>This procurement (N44255-04-R-9102) is being issued UNRESTRICTED under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 236210.  The corresponding SBA size standard is $28.5 Million.  The estimated cost range for this solicitation is over $100,000,000.  This procurement will result in a firm fixed price contract.  

Only U.S. citizens may participate in this solicitation and resultant contract.

Solicitation N44255-04-R-9102 will be available on or about 15 days from initial posting of pre-solicitation notice.  NOTE:  Full plans and specifications will not be available until approximately November 2005.

This project will construct an 180,000-ft2 multi-level (approximately 270 ft by 360 ft), below-grade, earth covered, internal and external blast hardened, heavily reinforced concrete structure.  Special features of the facility include:  Two tunnels (approximately 400 ft long, 20 ft wide, and 16 ft tall) to provide heavy vehicle access to and from the below-grade levels; above ground mechanical and production support buildings; power-operated physical security and blast-resistant doors; (7) overhead bridge cranes (2 ton capacity), (3) elevators, lightning protection system, grounding system, emergency air purge system, and multiple independent HVAC systems (approximately 11).  This project will also provide a new observation tower, utilities, and other site improvements.  The existing perimeter fence, and roads will be expanded to encompass the new facility.  The anticipated contract duration is approximately 1235 calendar days.  The exact duration will be stipulated in the solicitation.  

The Navy intends to issue the construction solicitation in two parts:

Part I will consist of Prequalifying of Sources in accordance with DFARS 236.272.  The purpose of Prequalifying firms is to develop a list of Qualified Firms who possess the proven competence to perform the construction of MCON P-973.  No pricing will be requested during prequalifications however firms must demonstrate the capability of bonding over $100,000,000.  The solicitation shall state the prequalification requirements but it is anticipated to include Prime and Major Subcontractor Experience.  Additionally, the Government will conduct a responsibility determination consistent with FAR Part 9.  Only firms who participate in the Prequalification of Sources and are determined to possess the necessary competencies will be able to participate in Part II, the Construction Request for Proposals (RFP).

It is anticipated that offerors will need to request by e-mail Part I of the solicitation, prequalification from the contracting officer (mark.snell@navy.mil).  

The Government reserves the right to reject any or all prequalification submissions at any time.  FIRMS ARE ADVISED THAT THE DETERMINATION OF PREQUALIFIED FIRMS MAY BE MADE WITHOUT COMMUNICATIONS OR CLARIFICATIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PREQUALIFICATION SUBMISSION RECEIVED.  Therefore, prequalification submissions should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms.  Firms should not assume that they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify or revise their qualifications.  FIRMS SUBMITTING PREQUALFICATIONS WILL NOT BE COMPENSATED.  

Once the prequalification procedures are conducted, qualified Prime Construction Contractors will be posted to the Navy’ s www.esol.navfac.navy.mil website for subcontracting opportunities.  All prime contractors/subcontractors/suppliers are advised to register and periodically review www.esol.navfac.navy.mil for any changes/additions.  There will be no site visits during prequalifications.  It is anticipated that a pre-proposal conference will be scheduled.  

Estimated closing date for receipt of prequalification submissions is 14:00 local time (PST), approximately 63 calendar days from initial posting of the pre-solicitation notice.  

Part II will consist of Source Selection (negotiated) best value procedures, as it has been determined in accordance with FAR 6.401 to be the most appropriate method of contracting for the subject project.  Only those firms found to possess the necessary competencies as stipulated in the Prequalification will participate in Part II, the Construction RFP.  It is anticipated that this procurement will be evaluated on the following factors:  1) Technical (Past Performance; Safety); 2) Management (Key Personnel; Management Organization; Small Business Utilization); and 3) Price.  Proposals will be evaluated to determine which offer provides the best value to the Government.    

The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous to the Government.

This effort shall include the replacement of the Permanent Magnetic Generator (PMG) wiring on thirty-one (31) aircraft that have not had the PMG wiring replaced when inducted for the AWICS modification.     Additionally, the effort shall include an option to provide Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS) harness replacements.     This effort will commence 15 April 2006 and continue for one year.     The proposed order will be awarded on a sole source basis to Boeing Aerospace Operations (BAO), Oklahoma City, OK.     The BAO teams currently on site at MCAS New River and MCAS Miramar, performing AFCS wire harness replacements, shall accomplish the AWICS and PMG wiring modifications, as well as the wire harness replacements, if required.     The authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2304(d)(1)(B), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, award to a source other than the original source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government, which is not expected to be recovered through competition and would also result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's needs.     For these reasons, a competition will not be conducted.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The  National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute?s Consolidated Operations Acquisition Center for the National Human Genome Research Institute intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Dr. Hasan Albacha-Hejazi, 6618 Robin Forest, San Antonio, Texas, 78239,  to continue an ongoing collaborator under protocol OH97-HG-N035, titled Cleft Lip Palate Study.  The Statement of Work is as follows: Background: The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Division of Intramural Research (DIR), overall mission is to develop and implement technology for the rapid isolation, analysis, and treatment of genetic diseases.  The Division?s research laboratories and clinical branches develop and use the most advanced techniques to study the fundamental mechanisms of inherited and acquired genetic disorders.   Research also includes planning and conducting clinical trials to test DNA-based methods for treatment and perhaps the sure of such diseases.  Researchers collect and study families in which important diseases are inherited as well as, translate basis science advances into effective, reliable, and cost effective DNA and cytogenetic-based diagnostics.   The purpose of this procurement is to provide professional services to the researchers dedicated to the study.  These services will be in the areas of: determination of eligibility, patient registration, clinical evaluation of family members, and biological sample collection and shipment.  The objective of the study is to identify the gene(s) involved in heritable oral clefts by linkage analysis and gene mapping strategies.  Characterization of genes involved in causing inherited oral clefts could provide important insights into the inheritance and pathogenesis of this disease.    Description of Work: Specifically, the Contractor will engage in several activities, including: (1) determination eligibility, (2) patient registration, (3) clinical evaluation of family members, (4) biological sample collection and shipment, etc.  The Contractor will work with the research team and other member of the NHGRI on a weekly basis.  They will communicate progress and provide summary activities, both orally and in writing, to Principal Investigator on a quarterly progress report, the Contractor will deliver the pedigree data and biological specimens as collection of each family is completed.  The Contractor will meet the principal investigator at a scientific meeting as needed for planning and development of the data collection efforts.  The Contractor will work independently with no direct supervision by any government employee.  The studies?

Additional data and biological specimens are needed from individuals who are members of families determined to have multiple family members affected with hereditary oral clefts to ensure detection of all important genetic effects.  An award to any other source for the items would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

This announcement is only a summary of Parts 1 and 2 of the BAA and does not represent the entire BAA.  Offerors must download th e entire BAA as posted on the Interagency Business Opportunities Page (IBOP) at https://abop.monmouth.army.mil.  In addition, all amendments to this BAA will only be posted at the IBOP.  There will be no formal request for proposal or any further solicitat ion document issued in regard to this BAA.  Therefore, interested parties should be alert for any amendments that may be published.  It is recommended that all interested parties register for the solicitation specific mailing list that will provide email n otification of any updates to the BAA.  White papers and full proposals will also be submitted to the Government via the IBOP web site.  No paper copies will be accepted.  White papers are due at noon (eastern) on 17 March 2006 and September 2006 award(s) are anticipated.  Award(s) against this BAA can be made for three years after receipt of proposals and notification of selectability.  Specific costs and terms and conditions will be negotiated prior to award.  The Government contemplates the awarding of C ost Reimbursement (Cost, CPFF) type contract(s); however, proposals based on other contract types will be considered.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  The maximum length of an award will be three years.  There is no a priori judgment regarding the number or size of individual awards or the allocation of total research and development funds across the technology solutions listed above. Prospective Offerors should note that this BAA is an ex pression of interest only and does not commit the Government to make an award or pay proposal preparation costs generated in response to this announcement.  The cost of proposal preparation for response to a BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge  to any resultant contract or any other contract.  However, it may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. Funds, beyond the current Fiscal Year, are not presently available for the research interest s represented in this BAA, however, funds are planned in the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP) for this research.  No contract award will be made unless appropriated funds are available for payment for the effort being acquired.  Prospective offerors are fu rther reminded that only a duly warranted Contracting Officer may obligate the Government.  Any resultant contract award would include all clauses required by Federal Acquisition Regulations and appropriate supplements.  This BAA is intended for the develo pment of research efforts in support of the NVESD Ground Combat Systems Division.  Specific information on program goals is provided in Part II, Program Description.  In order for any proposal to be considered, the proposed effort MUST meet the definition of basic or applied research and development found at FAR 35.001.  Submission of white papers is mandatory prior to submission of a full proposal.  Submission of full proposals will be at the written request of the Government upon completion of the white p aper evaluation.  The selection of one or more proposals for award will be based on a peer and scientific evaluation of each Offerors response (to include both technical and cost aspects) to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to this announcement.  Potential Offerors are reminded that only a duly warranted contracting officer may obligate the Government to an agreement involving the expenditu re of Government funds.  Prior to white paper submission, potential offerors are encouraged to contact the Subject Matter Expert (SME), Mr. Timothy Watts, NVESD, at timothy.watts@nvl.army.mil with a carbon copy to the Contract Specialist.  However, after w hite paper submission, all questions and discussions must be directed to the Contracting Officer.  Offerors are encouraged to use the IBOP question and answer function.  However, in the event that is not feasible, questions may be directed to the Contract Specialist Nancy Lyons, 703-325-6152 or email: nancy.lyons@cacw.army.mil.  No discussion is to be held with Offerors by the technical staff after white paper submission without the permission of the Contracting Officer. The POCs for this BAA are (1) Ground  Combat Systems Division SME: Mr. Timothy M. Watts, Multi-Spectral AiTR Project Leader, Tel: 703-704-1356, Fax: 703-704-1111, E-mail: timothy.watts@nvl.army.mil, and (2) C-E LCMC Acquisition Center Contracting Officer: Ms. Peggy A. Melanson, Tel:  703-325- 6096, Fax:  703-428-1658, E-mail:  peggy.melanson@cacw.army.mil. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION.  This BAA is for the technical advancement of multi-spectral aided target recognition algorithms that will use imagery from multi-spectral infrared imaging sensors.  A ty pical multi-spectral sensor providing imagery for the algorithms would utilize a detector array that is sensitive in the nominal 3um  5um midwave infrared (MWIR) and 8um  10um longwave infrared (LWIR) portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.  State-of-t he-art sensors of this type typically utilize a detector with an approximate cell size of 20um for MWIR and LWIR, and an integration time of up to 9msec for MWIR and up to 200 usec for LWIR.  The algorithm should be capable of performing target detection, target recognition, and multiple target tracking under a variety of background, clutter, and atmospheric conditions.  The algorithms should be capable of tracking multiple targets for extended periods of time over large fields of regard, be capable of supp orting rapid Wide Area Search (WAS), and the scanning of a large field of regard in excess of the sensors nominal fields of view.  It is desired that algorithm capabilities to be maintained if integrated onto a vehicle and that host platform is on the mov e (OTM).  The following details metrics that represent the expected capabilities of future AiTR algorithms, for guidance:  Field of Regard (FOR): 360 degrees  x 9 degrees; Time to Detect/Recognize (Throughout FOV): 8 second (Detect), 8 seconds (Recognize);  Detection Range (Pd 70 percent (OTM)): 1.5x (1.1x) (normalized ranges); False Alarm Rate: 1.2y / deg squared (normalized ranges); On The Move Rate: 50 Kph.  Long term objectives for a field implementation of these algorithms include the detection and reco gnition of targets that are partially occluded, are contained within high clutter backgrounds, provide aided target detection and aided target recognition at extended ranges commensurate with future Army combat vehicles, and possess improved false alarm ra tes and detection times in an extended FOR.  A two-phase approach will be used for this effort, and contractors are encouraged to structure their response, including cost proposal, in this manner.  Phase one will consist of multi-spectral imagery phenomeno logy studies and baseline performance evaluations of the proposed algorithms.  Training imagery will be provided, consisting of military vehicle targets.  Typical targets of this class include tanks, armored personnel vehicles, all terrain vehicles, and et c.  Algorithm performance evaluation and scoring will be performed using sequestered imagery data sets.  Offerors shall expect algorithm evaluations to be condu cted approximately every six to eight weeks after initial program start-up and an initial test readiness meeting.  Once the algorithm has been evaluated and scored for fully exposed targets of various aspect angles under benign clutter conditions, the Gove rnment will consider, on an individual contract basis, whether or not to proceed with phase two.  The period of performance for Phase One will be approximately 12 months.  Phase Two will continue the evaluation of the algorithm through the introduction of imagery consisting of partially obscured targets, increasing levels of clutter, and degraded atmospheric conditions.  A variety of backgrounds and clutter, atmospheric conditions, target aspects, and target exposures will be used.  A develop-test-fix-confi rm cycle approach will be implemented.  Training data will be provided for each cycle.  A blind test evaluation, using sequestered imagery, will then be conducted.  Once an evaluation is completed, the Government will debrief the Offeror of their measured performance and will provide feedback with particular emphasis on specific areas that either fail to meet expected performance or exceed expected performance.  The Offeror will then be allowed to modify their algorithm and rerun the test to confirm adequat e performance.  Confirmation of the algorithm fixes will give confidence that the algorithm is ready to proceed onto a more complex data set.  This approach allows for the algorithm to be progressively evaluated and modified using increasingly complex data  sets.  Upon completion of the Phase Two effort, the Offeror will provide to the Government a complete version of the algorithm, including an algorithm description document and a final report.

<ARCHDATE>06092006
<CONTACT>Steven Perry, 3097821088
<DESC>Estimated issue date of Amendment 022 is February 24, 2006. Estimated closing date is April 10, 2006. The purpose of this amendment is to reopen the solicitation to augment the award pools established for full & open competition and small business concerns in Segments 1-3 to promote additional competition and production capacity.  The solicitation, origina lly issued on September 13, 2002, is for the procurement of various Sets, Kits and Outfits and may be referred to as the SKO solicitation. The term sets, kits, and outfits collectively refers to a wide variety of tools and equipment used to support the Arm y's tactical and combat support weapon systems and its Ordnance and Combat missions.  This amendment will likely result in the award of multiple contracts to expire concurrently with the existing award pool contracts.  A contract under a particular segment will give the awardee the opportunity to compete for future requirements in that Segm ent.  This amendment will not result in the award of a delivery order for any of the sample requirements.   We are soliciting proposals from both large and small businesses.  Delivery Orders will be competed in accordance with the fair opportunity to compete provisions set forth in the original solicitation.  The award of a contract is not a guarantee that an or   der will be placed against that contract.  The award only signifies that the awardee is eligible to compete for delivery orders pursuant to the fair opportunity to compete provisions.  We will use the contracts, consistent with the fair opportunity to co mpete provisions, to fulfill its SKO requirements unless otherwise exempted by law or regulation. In order to promote competition this requirement was divided into the following segments in the original solicitation: Segment 1 Mechanical Maintenance Tool Kits:  An assemblage of mostly hand tools used by automotive, aircraft, and equipment mechanics, and others in the mechanical trades for performing field maintenance and repair.  The kit is transported to its place of final use in a single person or multi-person carry tool container.  These kits are go-to-war items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. Segment 2 Construction/Engineer Tool Kits:  An assemblage of mostly hand tools, including powered hand tools, primarily used in the construction trades to perform construction and repair of facilities, power lines, etc.; transported to its place of final u se in a single person or multi-person carry tool container.  These kits are go-to-war items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. Segment 3 Specialized Tool Kits:  Assemblages of hand tools, measuring tools and equipment, or special-purpose tools and equipment used to perform a specific mission not normally associated with mechanical maintenance or building trades.  These kits may be   housed in a single or multiple hand carry containers.  These kits are go-to-war items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. Segment 4 Containerized Shop Sets:  An assemblage of tools and machinery used to perform field tasks (maintenance, repair, assembly, disassembly, disabling, adjustment, testing, etc.) on equipment or field construction, transported to its place of use as a   unit in a container or shelter, which is considered to be part of the mobile shop set.  Usually some of the components of a mobile shop may be permanently mounted to the container or shelter by mounting bolts or other fasteners.  These sets are go-to-war  items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. Segment 5 Vehicle/Trailer Mounted Shop Sets: An assemblage of tools and machinery used to perform field maintenance or field construction, transported to its place of use as a unit in a purpose-built vehicle body or trailer, which is considered to be part of the shop set.  Usually some of the components of the shop se t a re permanently mounted to its carrier by mounting bolts or other fasteners.  These sets are go-to-war items used by the military in the battlefield to carry wartime operations. Segments 1-3 will be individually competed and awarded under this amendment.  Segments 4 and 5 may be augmented at a later date.  The Army intends to augment, or add to, the  award pools already established for each segment:  one under full and open compet ition and the other for small business concerns.  As stated in the original solicitation, the Government reserves the right to augment the award pools from time to time to promote additional competition or to secure production capacity concerns. Offerors may submit proposals for one or more of Segments 1-3 in accordance with the Section L Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Offerors in this amendment. Each segment shall require offerors to submit a technical and past performance proposal base d on the sample  requirement that was used to create the award pools under the original solicitation.  The sample for each of the segments are as follows:   	Segment 1:  Small Arms Repairman Tool Kit  Segment 2: Engineer ConstructionCarpenterTool Kit; 	Segment 3:  Explosive Ordnance Disposal Tool Kit;  These DFPs are located on our open solicitation page as Attachments 001, 003, and 005. Offers will be evaluated in accordance with the Section entitled Evaluation Factors for Award included in this amendment. Contract clauses that will be applicable to resulting award pool contracts will e included in this amendment. If interested contact perrys2@ria.army.mil or lisa.devlin@us.army.mil.  We will include you on the formal amendment notice.   Vendors wishing an electronic copy may download it on or after the issue date by accessing the following address via the internet: https://aais.ria.army.mil/aais/SOLINFO/index.htm. CAUTION: This solicitation will be issued electronically as will any amendm ents thereto. Because of this, the Government is under no obligation and is in fact unable to maintain a bidders mailing list. It is therefore incumbent upon any interested parties to periodically access the above internet address in order to obtain any a m endments which may be issued. Failure to obtain any said amendments and to respond to them prior to the date and time s et for bid opening/receipt of proposals may render your bid or proposal nonresponsive and result in the rejection of same.

<DESC>This procurement (N44255-04-R-9102) is being issued UNRESTRICTED under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 236210.  The corresponding SBA size standard is $28.5 Million.  The estimated cost range for this solicitation is over $100,000,000.  This procurement will result in a firm fixed price contract.  

Only U.S. citizens may participate in this solicitation and resultant contract.

Part I of Solicitation N44255-04-R-9102 will be available on 27 June 2005.  NOTE:  Full plans and specifications will not be available until approximately November 2005.

This project will construct an 180,000-ft2 multi-level (approximately 270 ft by 360 ft), below-grade, earth covered, internal and external blast hardened, heavily reinforced concrete structure.  Special features of the facility include:  Two tunnels (approximately 400 ft long, 20 ft wide, and 16 ft tall) to provide heavy vehicle access to and from the below-grade levels; above ground mechanical and production support buildings; power-operated physical security and blast-resistant doors; (7) overhead bridge cranes (2 ton capacity), (3) elevators, lightning protection system, grounding system, emergency air purge system, and multiple independent HVAC systems (approximately 11).  This project will also provide a new observation tower, utilities, and other site improvements.  The existing perimeter fence, and roads will be expanded to encompass the new facility.  The anticipated contract duration is approximately 1235 calendar days.  The exact duration will be stipulated in the solicitation.  

The Navy intends to issue the construction solicitation in two parts:

Part I will consist of Prequalifying of Sources in accordance with DFARS 236.272.  The purpose of Prequalifying firms is to develop a list of Qualified Firms who possess the proven competence to perform the construction of MCON P-973.  No pricing will be requested during prequalifications however firms must demonstrate the capability of bonding over $100,000,000.  The solicitation shall state the prequalification requirements but it is anticipated to include Prime and Major Subcontractor Experience.  Additionally, the Government will conduct a responsibility determination consistent with FAR Part 9.  Only firms who participate in the Prequalification of Sources and are determined to possess the necessary competencies will be able to participate in Part II, the Construction Request for Proposals (RFP).

Offerors will need to request by e-mail Part I of the solicitation, prequalification from the contracting officer (mark.snell@navy.mil).  

The Government reserves the right to reject any or all prequalification submissions at any time.  FIRMS ARE ADVISED THAT THE DETERMINATION OF PREQUALIFIED FIRMS MAY BE MADE WITHOUT COMMUNICATIONS OR CLARIFICATIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PREQUALIFICATION SUBMISSION RECEIVED.  Therefore, prequalification submissions should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms.  Firms should not assume that they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify or revise their qualifications.  FIRMS SUBMITTING PREQUALFICATIONS WILL NOT BE COMPENSATED.  

Once the prequalification procedures are completed, qualified Prime Construction Contractors will be posted to the Navy’ s www.esol.navfac.navy.mil website to facilitate subcontracting opportunities.  All prime contractors/subcontractors/suppliers are advised to register and periodically review www.esol.navfac.navy.mil for any changes/additions.  There will be no site visits during prequalifications.  

A pre-proposal conference is scheduled for 9 August 2005 at the Assembly Hall at Jackson Park Community Center, Bremerton, WA.  Registration and a map are provided at www.esol.navfac.navy.mil.  

Estimated closing date for receipt of prequalification submissions is 14:00 local time (PDT), 15 September 2005.

After the completion of Part I of the solicitation, Part II can commence.  Part II will consist of Source Selection (negotiated) best value procedures, as it has been determined in accordance with FAR 6.401 to be the most appropriate method of contracting for the subject project.  Only those firms found to possess the necessary competencies as stipulated in the Prequalification will participate in Part II, the Construction RFP.  It is anticipated that this procurement will be evaluated on the following factors:  1) Technical (Past Performance; Safety); 2) Management (Key Personnel; Management Organization; Small Business Utilization); and 3) Price.  Proposals will be evaluated to determine which offer provides the best value to the Government.    

The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous to the Government.  OFFERORS ARE ADVISED THAT AN AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms.  Offerors should not assume that they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  OFFERORS SUBMITTING TECHNICAL AND PRICE PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE COMPENSATED.  

Anticipated construction contract award is January 2006.

Full plans and specifications will be issued only during Part II, Construction RFP.    Subcontractors/Suppliers shall be notified of plans and specifications availability via ESOL only.  It is each firm’s responsibility to periodically check www.esol.navfac.navy.mil for the specific date that plans and specifications shall be made available.  It is anticipated that offerors shall be charged for plans and specifications.  Additional information regarding plans and specifications distribution and charges will be included in the Part I Prequalification RFP.

It is anticipated that an additional pre-proposal conference will be scheduled after the completion of Part I of the solicitation and issuance of Part II Construction Request For Proposal.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command at Patuxent River, MD, intends to negotiate and award a cost plus fixed fee order to procure technical and engineering support to modify a total of ninety-seven (97) CH-46E aircraft with Airborne Wireless Intercommunication Systems (AWICS) at MCAS New River, NC and MCAS Miramar, CA, under an existing Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA), N00019-05-G-0012.  This effort shall include the replacement of the Permanent Magnetic Generator (PMG) wiring on thirty-one (31) aircraft that have not had the PMG wiring replaced when inducted for the AWICS modification.  Additionally, the effort shall include an option to provide Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS) harness replacements.  This effort will commence 15 April 2006 and continue for one year.  The proposed order will be awarded on a sole source basis to Boeing Aerospace Operations (BAO), Oklahoma City, OK.  The BAO teams currently on site at MCAS New River and MCAS Miramar, performing AFCS wire harness replacements, shall accomplish the AWICS and PMG wiring modifications, as well as the wire harness replacements, if required.  The authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2304(d)(1)(B), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, award to a source other than the original source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government, which is not expected to be recovered through competition and would also result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's needs.  For these reasons, a competition will not be conducted.  
See Numbered Note 22.

The NAICS code for this effort is changed from 541990 to 336413. See Solicitation Number N00019-06-P7-ZD138.

<DESC>This is Modification 2 to the synopsis entitled TEAMING OPPORTUNITY FOR NASA KSC TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER OFFICE which was posted on February 2, 2006. You are notified that Technology Area 6 entitled "Microwave Sintering of Loose Materials” is hereby added:  “6) Microwave Sintering of Loose Materials: NASA KSC is currently seeking partner(s) with expertise in manufacturing microwaves specifically designed for laboratory use.  A serious concern at a future lunar launch pad will be the amount of dust and flying object debris (FOD) kicked up by rocket exhaust.	A potential solution to this problem is to form a layer of larger agglomerates of regolith that will cover the loose regolith and prevent the FOD problem.  Loose regolith may be sintered into larger pieces, or bricks, using a standard microwave.  It is the goal of this project to develop methods for microwave sintering of lunar regolith into building materials that will prevent FOD problems during launches.  The project will identify 1) the ideal conditions for microwave sintering lunar regolith, 2) the components of the regolith are more suited to microwave sintering and 3) any promising additives.  This project will support future exploration systems work, especially ISRU, dust mitigation and operations. Qualifying partners must have experience in sintering of ceramics.  Features sought in the laboratory microwave include: (1) a magnetron pulse cycle of 1-2 seconds to allow for a more uniform heating process; (2) variable frequency (optimal range 2GHz-3GHz) and wattage control knob to allow precise tuning of the microwave; (3) stainless steel interior walls to avoid hot spots; (4) a ductwork connection to eliminate fumes; and (5) minimum interior dimensions of 6"x6"x6" capable of holding a mold for powdered materials.” ***************************************************************************************** *****************************************  The due date for responses is extended to February 24, 2006. Documents related to this teaming opportunity will be available over the Internet. These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application. The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/KSC Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=76  Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of any further modifications to this synopsis. Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the synopsis and modifications (if any).

The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to support ongoing operations worldwide.  The execution of the work under the Military C onstruction Program will be accomplished using a product line concept for the facilities.  The product line concept will be used for the construction of barracks, dining facilities, company operation facilities, headquarters buildings, vehicle maintena nce shops, unit and ammunition storage facilities, aviation facilities, equipment parking areas, and other features of the program.  Under the product line concept, Districts in the Corps of Engineers Southwestern and South Pacific Divisions will be assig ned one or two facility types and will be responsible for awarding Design-Build IDIQ contracts for their assigned type of facility (product line).

The BLM New Mexico is requesting commercially available information such as pamphlets, brochures, literature, etc., on units that may be considered in developing the requirement for future solicitation.  To acquire better understanding and knowledge of the types, sizes, and volume of the current records inventory, an organized site visit is scheduled at 10:00 AM on Tuesday, February 14, 2006.  Interested parties are encouraged to attend this site tour.  Participants will meet at the BLM/FS building lobby located at 1474 Rodeo Road, Santa Fe, New Mexico 87505.

<DESC>This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) (not a pre-solicitation notice pursuant to FAR Part 5).  The Social Security Administration (SSA) is seeking to identify sources for the purchase of water treatment chemicals and service associated with said chemicals for the Social Security Administration located in Baltimore, MD. (SSA Main Complex).  The SSA is currently conducting market research only.  No award is intended as a result of this synopsis nor does the Government intend to pay for information received. Any interested contractors will need to provide a continuous monitoring controller capable of direct measurement and control of corrosion and scale inhibitor in open recirculating water, a system to intermittently feed chemicals of all varieties to the closed loop water systems, provide boiler feed water treatment from solution tank to the feed water system and provide oxygen scavenger from solution tank to the feed water or the deaeration tank as appropriate.  Oxygen scavenger may be included in the boiler feed water treatment solution as an “all-in-one” treatment as long as scavenger levels are maintained.  All chemicals proposed for use at our facility will need to be verified as acceptable for use in the State of Maryland and must be approved by our facility.  Chemicals used for water treatment must comply with all United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Department Of Transportation (DOT) requirements, including packaging and labeling.  The contractor will need to provide a 24-hour emergency response hotline number to respond to chemical emergencies.  The contractor must have a minimum of 2 years experience in the water treatment industry or related field.  The contractor’s organization must be ISO 9002 certified in chemical manufacturing and laboratory analysis.  A contractor’s representative will need to be on-site once a week to conduct water testing, system improvements, and troubleshooting concerns as needed.  SSA is interested in receiving information with regard to the water treatment capabilities of small businesses. The NAICS Code for this procurement will be 325181 with its associated small business size standard of 1,000 employees.  The SSA has approximately nine (9) buildings within the main campus area that need the water treatment.  Offerors should submit statements or other descriptive data that describes their abilities to assist us in our water treatment efforts. Submissions shall be accepted via email at the following address rick.bolt@ssa.gov or by mail to the address shown below. Questions regarding this RFI should be directed to the above-mentioned point of contact via email only.

This notice is not a Request for Proposal (RFP); it is a market research tool being utilized to determine the availability of sources prior to issuing the RFP.

The intent of this sources sought notice is to identify potential Section 8 (a), HUBZone or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) offerors capable of replacing the existing uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system to support 24-hour continuous operation of the existing data center located at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  It is the intent and objective of the Government to enhance the reliability and maintainability of the facility electrical infrastructure to facilitate on-line maintenance of the systems while maintaining UPS protection to the data center computer loads.  The project includes the addition of a second UPS system, which will provide 2N redundancy, and the replacement of the existing UPS system.  The new system will be composed of a flywheel UPS with a backup diesel engine generator.  After the new UPS system is installed, the existing UPS system and its batteries will be removed and disposed of, and a new multi-module flywheel UPS system will be provided.  The replacement UPS system will have N+1 module redundancy.  The existing generators will remain as the backup system to the replacement UPS system.

<SUBJECT>63--Mobile Detection Assessment Response System (MDARS) Production and Fielding
<SOLNBR>W909MY-06-R-MDAR
<RESPDATE>030906
<ARCHDATE>05082006
<CONTACT>Sherry Savage, (703)325-6066
<DESC>This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) it is a market survey.  The purpose of this announcement is to request identification of potential sources from industry for production and fielding of the Armys Mobile Detection Assessment Response System (M DARS).  The Government intends to solicit in the near future for the FY07-FY11 full-rate production phase of the MDARS program.  MDARS consists of the MDARS Control Station (MCS),   robotic vehicles with a Mission Payload Suite (MPS) and Differential Globa l Positioning System (DGPS), and Associated Items of Support Equipment (ASIOE).  The MDARS procurement will be managed by the materiel developer, the Office of the Product Manager, Force Protection Systems (PM-FPS), at Fort Belvoir, VA.  The U.S. Army Mili tary Police School (USAMPS) is the combat developer.  The MDARS is designed to operate in environments such as materiel storage yards, arsenals, petroleum storage areas, airfields, rail yards, and port facilities.  Future versions of the MDARS will operate  in conjunction with fixed Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).  The major components of the MDARS are the MCS, the (MDARS) robotic vehicles with MPS and DGPS, and ASIOE.  High dollar value and critical US assets in external storage sites may be vulnerable t o an intruder or saboteur intending to deprive the US of these assets.  The objective of MDARS is to protect these assets by providing commanders with a highly secure, standardized, semi-autonomous IDS using robotics technology.  MDARS will introduce robot ic vehicles employing a suite of sensors that is controlled by a control station that houses monitoring and annunciation equipment. MDARS will satisfy an immediate Army requirement for a semi-autonomous mobile capability for patrolling physical security si tes at Department of Defense (DoD) installations.  Without operator intervention other than system initiation, the robotic vehicle will automatically move randomly to and throughout designated patrol areas in designated environments primarily during non-du ty hours.  While on random patrol, the robotic vehicle will semi-autonomously conduct surveillance, check for intruders, conduct product inventory, and check the status of facility barriers, such as gate and bunker/container doors.  Operator input from the  control station will be required only if an intruder is detected or the robotic vehicle encounters a situation it is not programmed to handle.  If the MDARS robotic vehicle detects an intruder, the video link to the control station will be activated and a n audio/visual alarm will be annunciated at the control station.  The security officer will be able to see, hear, and talk to the intruder as well as send the robotic vehicle to a location where the intruder might be hiding.  The robotic vehicles:  (1) det ect intruders, (2) read the status of locks on storage structures (open, closed or error), and (3) determine the status of inventory through the use of specialized Radio Frequency Identification transponder tags.  MDARS also will interface with RF/Microwav e and Hardwire/Fiber Optic communication networks.  Functional users of MDARS are supply and maintenance activities of the U.S. Army Materiel Command (AMC) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).  Approximately 7 depots are currently planned for operationa l deployment of MDARS, although more are expected to be added in the future.  MDARS will be operated by Department of Defense (DoD) security and law enforcement units.  To date MDARS has undergone Program Definition and Risk Reduction, which resulted in de velopment of brassboard models, and System Development and Demonstration (SDD), which is verifying producibility of the MDARS system and will be completed in mid-2006.  The production and fielding phase is expected to begin in 2007.  The MDARS production r obotic vehicle will be equipped with features such as collision avoidance, intruder detection and assessment, barrier assessment, and product inventory subsyste ms.  The robotic vehicle will respond to and communicate with the MDARS control station that uses the Government-developed, Multiple Resource Host Architecture (MRHA) command and control software.  Associated support equipment for the MDARS includes (a) Re mote Product and Barrier Assessment Items, (b) Communications Relay/Repeaters, (c) Navigation Aids, and (d) Hand-held control units.  Initially, logistics support and maintenance for MDARS will be provided by the production contractor or separate contractu al agreements at the installation level.  The contract for the Production phase will be Fixed Price with Indefinite Delivery ordering provisions.  The Production phase will be up to five years in duration.  The maximum value of the Production phase is 10 s ystems/sites.  Total contract life will not exceed 5 years.  The MDARS Draft Specification (ESPEC.PDF), Sources Sought questionnaire (QUESTIONS.PDF), and MDARS MRHA IDD (MDARS MRHA IDD.PDF)  are downloadable and posted on the CECOM Acquisition Center (CAC)  Interactive Business Opportunities Page (IBOP) at http://abop.monmouth.army.mil.  The documents are identified on the IBOP as Army Pre-award, CECOM-Market Research, W909MY-06-R-MDAR, Pre-Solicitation.  Responses to this announcement should be submitte d to Contract Specialist, Sherry Savage.  Responses to the Sources Sought questionnaire should be submitted via email to Sherry.Savage@us.army.mil, and are due on 9 March 2006.  Numbered Notes 22, 25, and 26 on the FedBizzOpps website apply (http://www2.fb o.gov/Numbered_Notes.html).  Responses can also be submitted in hard copy, video, or CD format and should be sent to Sherry Savage at the contracting office address listed in this announcement.

<SUBJECT>99 -- NATO Conference of National Armaments Directors (CNAD) Invitation to Participate in an Exhibition on Supporting Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs)
<DESC>The Conference of National Armaments Directors (CNAD) is the senior NATO body responsible for promoting cooperation in research and development of technology in support of production and procurement of defense equipment among NATO nations. The CNAD is comprised of the most senior defense procurement officials from all NATO countries.  

Twice a year the CNAD meets at NATO Headquarters in Brussels to discuss investment in military capabilities. During the CNAD meeting on April 26-27, 2006, NATO’s Defense Investment Division will host an industrial exhibition. It will give the representatives of a selected group of companies and research establishments from NATO countries the opportunity to exhibit their products, technological know-how, or R&T developments. Because it will be held at NATO Headquarters, the exhibition will draw the attention of senior military and diplomatic officials located in Brussels, as well as the senior acquisition decision-makers from capitals who will be attending CNAD.

The available space in the Headquarters is limited and therefore the organizers will have to be highly selective. They will strive for a mix of technologies to be shown, giving priority to exhibits that are interactive in nature. They will be looking for both large and small companies and research institutes to be represented, from as many of the 26 member nations as possible. The focus will be on emerging technologies or new equipment that has the potential to be used for Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs). 

Participation in this event is generally free of charge, i.e., no entrance fee will be requested by NATO. However, NATO will only cover local operating costs (light, heat, electricity). All other expenses (transportation of the equipment to the exhibition site at NATO Headquarters, insurance, setting up the equipment, manning the booth, etc.) must be paid by the exhibitors themselves.

ELIGIBLITY

Requests for participation sent directly to NATO cannot be considered. If your firm would like to apply for participation in this exhibition, you must complete a Questionnaire that will be provided by the U.S. Department of Commerce. To request a copy of the CNAD Questionnaire, send an email to Lcarpent@bis.doc.gov or Dnewsom@bis.doc.gov.  

The completed Questionnaire must be submitted to the CNAD Exhibition Team no later than February 27, 2006. Instructions for submission will be included with the Questionnaire. Also included will be information on PRTs and on some of their potential technology needs.

The selection of exhibitors will be completed by March 6, 2006. NATO CNAD will inform all applicants, selected or not, about the results of the selection process. A handbook that will assist in the set-up for and conduct of the event will then be sent to the selected exhibitors.

<DESC>Special Notice Flame Resistant Organizational Gear (FROG)  General Information Classification Codes:	84 - Clothing, Individual Equipment, and Insignia NAICS Code:	315228, 315331 Contracting Office Address Department of the Navy, United States Marine Corps, Marine Corps Systems Command, 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA, 22134-5010 Description The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) will host a Flame Resistant Clothing Industry Conference on February 23, 2006, at the Wingate Inn located in Stafford Virginia on February 23rd, 2006, starting at 8:30 a.m.  The Wingate Inn is located at 15 Salisbury Drive, Stafford, Virginia 22554, phone number 540-659-3600. The Marine Corps would like to explore capabilities and technologies that will protect the Marine from Improvised Explosive Devises, and other combat related injuries that are a result of fire.  This conference is part of   MARCORSYSCOM’s effort to identify potential sources and best practice information regarding the availability, design and development of Flame Resistant clothing items that will provide protection against flame, heat and flash point of no less than 800 degrees F (427 C) to the face, neck, upper torso, and extremities (arms, hands & legs).   The current uniform clothing system is composed of various uniform items.  The first layer of clothing the Marine wears is the base layer to include a t-shirt, socks and underwear.  The second layer is comprised of the Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform (MCCUU). The MCCUU is a blouse and trouser made of a 50/50 Nylon Cotton blend. The third layers include outerwear worn by the Marine, which includes but is not limited to Jackets, fleece pullovers, and Cold weather coats, boots, caps and gloves.  Lastly, special occupational fields in the Marine Corps require Marines to wear coveralls.  The current uniform, however, is not designed for fire/flame protection during USMC missions.   While the end items we seek include, but are not limited to; balaclava, face mask, bandana, neck gaiter, gloves, long sleeve t-shirts, boxers and long underwear drawers, jackets and coveralls, funding limitations dictate that MARCORSYSCOM give priority to face, neck and torso protection. The Flame Resistant Organizational Gear (FROG) will result in end items that will provide protection to the previously mentioned areas.  The items must pass all industry standard tests for heat and flame.  The desired final products must not melt, drip, burn, nor support combustion in the air.    Additionally, all items must be comfortable to wear, breathable, quick drying, machine washable and durable.  The base layer must also be moisture wicking and we seek an anti-microbial element as well.  Appropriate industry standard testing will determine the quality above listed properties.  You will be informed of all testing requirements at the conference. Please plan to present and submit results of any independent testing that will provide proof of claim to the above properties.   Note the Flame Resistant Organizational Gear (FROG) requirements are not yet complete and a formal solicitation has not yet been developed.   Berry Amendment restrictions will apply to any future procurement.  A known Berry Amendment waiver exists for the use of modacrylic fibers; however, the waiver does state that industry should continue to seek a domestically produced resolution to this problem.  In designing/developing FROG end items, companies are expected to apply best practice human-factors, casualty reduction analysis and business analysis to meet the needs of Marines.   At the conference, MARCORSYSCOM will provide an overview of current issues, uses, capability needs, constraints, and provide other information and answers to written questions or concerns received before the conference date.  A limited number of individual sessions can be arranged with the acquisition team by appointment to discuss company-specific ideas and concerns through the contracting officer.  Such one-on-one sessions will not exceed 30 minutes each and should include company qualifications, samples and best practice ideas towards creating FROG end items.  Companies wishing to attend the conference or make a session appointment should register by no later than 16 February, 2006, 4:00 PM Eastern Time, by emailing Mark Sanderson at mark.sanderson@usmc.mil.  Firms must limit participation in one-on-one meetings to three people.  Questions regarding this notice should be submitted to Mark Sanderson at mark.sanderson@usmc.mil.

A curriculum vitae of the principal investigator(s) should be appended together with any supporting information, such as reprints or preprints, which will assist in the evaluation of the pre-proposal.  Offerors submitting the most promising pre-proposals will be invited to submit a full technical and cost proposal on all or part of their pre-proposal submission. However, any such invitation does not assure a subsequent award.  Any offeror may submit a full technical proposal even if its pre-proposal was not identified as promising or if no pre-proposal is submitted; however any full proposal submission would be made without the benefit of feedback prior to full proposal submission.  A completed animal use protocol with supporting documentation is required when anim!  als are employed.  Any proposal that involves the experimental use of human subjects must include a separate evaluation of proposed technical approaches and associated risks by the contractor’s committee for protection of human subjects.  This evaluation must conform with current Department of the Navy instructions relating to the use of human subjects, DODD 3126.2 and SECNAVINST 3900.39C.  Offerors must state in their pre-proposals and full proposals that it is submitted in response to this BAA.  This BAA provides no funding for pre-proposals or subsequent proposal development purposes.  All pre-proposals will be acknowledged.  Proposals will not be returned after evaluation.  (3) Criteria for Selecting Proposals, their Relative Importance, and the Method of Evaluation  Pre-proposal and full technical proposal submissions will be evaluated on (1) the overall basis of innovation and scientific merit; (2) the relevance to submarine escape, rescue, and diving; (3) the overall value and affordability of the proposal; and (4) the offeror’s capabilities, strengths and weaknesses or unique combinations of these that are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives.  The Government reserves the right to select for funding any, all, part or none of the responses received. For efforts funded as contracts, evaluation of the socio-economic merits will include the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities.  This is to notify potential offerors that each contract that may be placed under this announcement, or solicitation to an institution of higher education must include the fol!  lowing clause:  “As a condition for receipt of funds available to the Department of Defense (DoD) under this award, the recipient agrees that it is not an institution that has a policy of denying, and that it is not an institution that effectively prevents the Secretary of Defense from obtaining for military recruiting purposes: (A) an entry to campuses or access to students on campuses; or (B) access to directory information pertaining to students.  If the recipient is determined, using procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement Section 558 of Public Law 103-337 (1994), to be such an institution during the period of performance of this agreement, and therefore to be in breach of this clause, the Government will cease all payments of DoD funds under this agreement and all other DoD grants and cooperative payments unilaterally for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of award. If your institution has been identified under the procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement Section 558, then: (1) no funds available to DoD may be provided to your institution through any contract, including any existing contract, (2) as a matter of policy, this restriction also applies to  any cooperative agreement, and (3) your institution is not eligible to receive a contract or cooperative agreement in response to this solicitation." See instructions above for pre-proposals and proposals. The Government’s preference is to award definitive contracts under this BAA. However, an award can be made via grant at the sole discretion of the Government.  All responsive sources may submit proposals that will be considered by NSWCPC.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals or join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete and severable areas of submarine escape, rescue, and diving for exclusive competition among these entities.  This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d) (2) (i).  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement. Questions regarding this announcement should be directed to the Contract Specialist identified herein.  Technical content questions should be addressed to CAPT John Murray, Deep Submergence Biomedical Development Program Manager,  (202) 781-4361.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Direct Analysis in Real Time, orthogonal acceleration Time-of- Flight Mass Spectrometer [DART/oa-TOFMS]
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [U S EPA] Environmental Sciences Division [ESD] intends to award a sole source fixed-price Purchase Order using Federal Acquisition Regulation [FAR] Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, to JEOL, USA, of Peabody, Massachusetts.    The purpose of this acquisition is to purchase a Direct Analysis in Real Time, orthogonal acceleration Time-of- Flight Mass Spectrometer [DART/oa-TOFMS] to rapidly analyze large numbers of wipe samples, while providing exact masses accurate to within 4 mmu and relative isotopic abundances (RIAs) accurate to within 15% for the ions in the mass spectra. It has been determined that JEOL, USA, is the only vendor uniquely qualified to meet these requirements as there are no other commercially available instruments that provide a linear dynamic range of 104 and surface sampling that is simple and rapid and that requires no manual manipulation of multiple samples during data acquisition. The instrument must also discriminate against mass interferences when measuring ion abundances of isotopic peaks.  Required time to acquire data for a sample is ten [10] seconds and only full scan data is necessary to measure exact masses and RIAs.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 334516.  NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE [RFQ] IS AVAILABLE.  Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA’s requirement as stated herein may submit a response which, if received within 15 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered.  Responses to this posting must be in writing.  A determination not to compete the proposed Purchase Order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All questions should be directed to Cheryl M. O’Donnell via email at odonnell.cheryl@epa.gov.

<SUBJECT>--REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - SHORT RANGE WIRELESS PRODUCT
<DESC>NCI is under contract to White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) for test range engineering and program support.  Under this effort, NCI will be implementing a secure wireless network to support test data collection and transport.  NCI provides this request  for information (RFI) for those vendors that have off-the-shelf products that can support the WSMR wireless requirements.  NCI is interested in those off-the-shelf wireless products that are open standards based.  A specific need is for a short range wire less product (up to five miles) that is 802.11b compatible, but transmits in the 1.8GHz to 1.9GHz frequency spectrum, and provides mobile capability.  The 1.8 GHz system should provide 802.11a/b/g services translated to the 1.8 GHz frequencies either by replicating the 802.11a/b/g PHY in the 1.8 GHz spectrum or by converting 2.4 GHz 802.11a/b/g PHY signals to 1.8 GHz. The complete system must conform to the specifications of the 802.11a/b/g PHY as described in the standards.  As a separate component, the converter must meet the following requirements, as a minimum: ·	+/- 2.5 PPM frequency stability ·	50 ohm RF connection ·	Transmit power-on ramp for 10% to 90% maximum power no greater than 2 µs. ·	Transmit power-down ramp for 90% to 10% maximum power no greater than 2 µs.  ·	Noise Figure 3.5 dB ·	Minimum transmitter output power 500mW with 3 non-overlapping channels. Systems that are ruggedized are desired, but not required.  Systems must be able to receive and transmit in a secure mode. In responding to the RFI, the vendor should provide the availability of the identified equipment, and the capabilities of the equipment.  The vendor should indicate whether a demonstration system can be provided for up to three months of testing.  If the v endor has the identified equipment in use by the DoD or U.S. Government, than provide up to three references of those users.  In providing a response to the RFI, marketing materials or slips sheets are acceptable, but the vendor should also provide additio nal annotation of those capabilities in the materials that are not available off-the-shelf.  Alternative frequency spectrums may be acceptable, and can be submitted by vendors. While this information is intended to support future acquisition efforts, there is no guarantee that this RFI will lead to procurement. NCI requests that all responses be no longer than 10 pages in length and be submitted within 45 days after this RFI request.  Please submit your responses and any questions about this RFI to:   Mr. Mel Santana NCI Information Systems, Inc. Building 1504, Suite 100 88002-0427 White Sands Missile Range, NM  Email: melchor.a.santana@us.army.mil. DO NOT CONTACT MARI B. BECKLER

<DESC>THIS IS THE CONTINUED PORTION OF HSCG38-05-Q-101001
Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is attached.
NOTICE OF FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair nd timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

	1. legally resided in the United States (U.S.);
	2. worked for the U.S. overseas in a Federal or military capacity; or
	3. been a dependent of a Federal or military employee serving overseas.

If the individual is not a U.S. citizen, they must be from a country allied with the U.S.  The following website provides current information regarding allied countries: http://www.opm.gov/employ/html/citizen.htm.

By signing this contract or commitment document, or by commencing performance, the contractor agrees to this restriction.

NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (OCT 2005)

Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201)1 entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I.
 
1.	Long-Term Contractor Personnel: 

In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:     

a.	Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB  No. 1615-0047,  " Employment Eligibility Verification, "  and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);

b.	Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents.  This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;

c.	Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position.  Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:  
 
	•	High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)
	•	Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)
	•	Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation
    
d.	The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a:  

	1)	Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; 
	2)	Favorable fingerprint results; 
	3)	Favorable credit report, if required;3 
	4)	Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and 
	5)	Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC)4 portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level.  

	A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements. 
 
	If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM ' s scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). 
 
e.	Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated.  If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.
 
2.	Short-Term Contractor Personnel:  

It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above.  The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are:
 
a.	Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; 
b.	Favorable fingerprint results; 
c.	Favorable credit report, if required;5 and 
d.	Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment.  The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated.  

A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance.  This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period.  This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process. 
For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements.  However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered “long-term” and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy.  

3.	Intermittent Contractors:

An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors.  

a.	For purposes of this policy, “intermittent” is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access.  For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract.  
b.	Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department’s escort policy.  Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access.   

c.	Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required.  

d.	If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.

e.	If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year.  If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year. 
  
4.	An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements.  

5.	The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice.

NOTES:

1 FIPS 201 is available at:  www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201/FIPS-201-022505.pdf

2 Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer.  The PIV-I identity proofing process, including initiation and adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of whether it is the current practice to issue a badge.  The second phase of HSPD-12 implementation (PIV-II) requires badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors.

3 For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package.

4 In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating investigations to OPM.  Per OPM ' s instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code " 3" must be placed in block  " B "  of the  " Agency Use Only "  section of the investigative form.  This report is available for all case types.

5 For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package.

UNSAFE CONDITIONS DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIAL (JAR 2852.223-70) (JUN 1996)

(a)	"Unsafe condition" as used in this clause means the actual or potential exposure of contractor or Government employees to a hazardous material as defined in Federal Standard No. 313, and any revisions thereto during the term of this contract, or any other material or working condition designated by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) as potentially hazardous and requiring safety controls.

(b)	The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is responsible for issuing and administering regulations that require contractors to apprise its employees of all hazards to which they may be exposed in the course of their employment; proper conditions and precautions for safe use and exposure; and related symptoms and emergency treatment in the event of exposure.

(c)	Prior to commencement of work, contractors are required to inspect for and report to the contracting officer or designee the presence of, or suspected presence of, any unsafe condition including asbestos or other hazardous materials or working conditions in areas in which they will be working.

(d)	If during the performance of the work under this contract, the contractor or any of its employees, or subcontractor employees, discovers the existence of an unsafe condition, the contractor shall immediately notify the contracting officer, or designee (with written notice provided not later than three (3) working days thereafter) of the existence of an unsafe condition. Such notice shall include the contractor's recommendations for the protection and the safety of Government, contractor and subcontractor personnel and property that may be exposed to the unsafe condition.

(e)	When the Government receives notice of an unsafe condition from the contractor, the parties will agree on a course of action to mitigate the effects of that condition and, if necessary, the contract will be amended. Failure to agree on a course of action will constitute a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.

(f)	Nothing contained in this clause shall relieve the contractor or subcontractors from complying with applicable Federal, State, and local laws, codes, ordinances and regulations (including the obtaining of licenses and permits) in connection with hazardous material including but not limited to the use, disturbance, or disposal of such material.

Offerors who present similar contracts/orders should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contract/order to the requirements of the solicitation.  
Offerors lacking relevant past performance history, or for whom past performance information is either not available or has not been submitted to the Government, will receive a neutral rating for past performance.  A neutral rating will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.  However, the proposal with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the proposals of other offerors having acceptable or better past performance.
Offerors are cautioned that the Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any sources including sources outside of the Government.  The Government will obtain whatever information it deems most relevant to the required effort by telephonic and/or written inquiry.  This information may include Contracting Officer’s knowledge and experience with contracts he or she has written, Performance Assessment Reporting Systems (CPARS), or past performance information from any source.  The information contained in offeror's Past Performance submittals will be evaluated by the PCO with the assistance of a Contract Specialist, if assigned.  The PCO will evaluate the offeror's Past Performance using the following sub-factors, which are of equal importance.  (a) Quality:  The offeror’s demonstrated history of delivering products and services of high quality and compliance with contractual requirements.  Quality will be evaluated in terms of: overall customer satisfaction, instances of rework and/or deficiency reports, and evidence of effective and/or innovative work applications that were beneficial to the customer.  (b)Timeliness: The offeror’s compliance with delivery and/or performance schedules, timeliness of submission of requested information, reports, and invoicing.  (c) Contractor Responsiveness:  The offeror’s demonstrated ability to respond to customer concerns, isolate and resolve problems, and take systemic improvement action.  Each performance risk assessment of the factors listed above will consider:  the number, type, and severity of problems, the effectiveness of corrective actions taken and the overall work record.  The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror’s performance on a list of contracts, but rather the product of subjective judgment of the government after it considers all available, relevant and recent information, therefore the adjectival ratings generally correlate with the definitions of performance risk as follows:   Very Low Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, virtually no doubt exists that the offeror will very successfully perform the required effort. Performance meets and exceeds contractual requirements to the Federal Government’s benefit.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective.  This equates to Highly Acceptable (HA).
Low Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Performance meets contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appears or were satisfactory. This equates to Highly Acceptable (HA).
Moderate Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Performance does not meet some contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions or the contractor’s proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented. This equates to Acceptable (A).  High Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, significant doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed contains serious problem(s) for which the contractor’s corrective actions appear or were ineffective. This equates to Marginal (M).
Neutral:  No relevant past performance history, or for which past performance information is not provided or available.  Unknown performance risk assessment.  This equates to Neutral (N).  Under most circumstances, it will be unnecessary to divulge the solicitation number, or other identifying information to the reference.  In the event that it is necessary, you need to obtain a non-disclosure statement from the party to whom the information was provided.  The assessment of the offeror’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offerors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFP.  In determining the rating of past performance evaluation factor, the Government will give greater consideration to the contracts which the Government determines are most relevant to the RFP.   2.  Price:  The PCO will evaluate Price.  When the proposals are received, the PCO shall review the submission of offers as specified in FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instruction to Offerors– Commercial Items (Jan 2004), paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(11).  The Government intends to make a single award to the responsible offeror whose total offer is the most advantageous to the Government.  Offers must include prices for the CLIN listed.  Failure to do this may be cause for rejection of the offer for the CLIN listed.  The offeror’s proposed price will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.404-1.  The evaluation may include, but is not limited to:   a)	Price comparison with other offerors; 
b)	Completeness:  All pricing information as it directly relates to the SOW; and  c)	Comparison with independent Government estimates.  Although price is the least most important evaluation factor, it has the potential to become more significant during the evaluation process.  The degree of importance of the price will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals in relation to the other factor on which selection is to be based.  The importance of price will also increase when a proposal's price is so significantly high as to diminish the value to the Government that might be gained under the other aspects of the offer.  If, at any stage of the evaluation, all offeror’s are determined to have submitted equal, or virtually equal, or generally equivalent, non-price proposals, price could become the factor in determining which offeror shall received the award.  3.  Best Value Determination.  The Government reserves the right to select an offeror with other than the best past performance, if the price is so advantageous to the Government as to constitute best value.  On the other hand, the Government may select an offeror with other than the lowest price if the quality of past performance and a fair and reasonable price of a competitor result in the greatest value to the Government.  Any such determination of best value will be made by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the evaluation criteria identified in this plan and the solicitation.   (b) Options. N/A.
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This is a Request For Proposals (RFP).  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation (RFP 06-3K06-007) is hereby issued as a request for proposal (RFP).  A sources sought was posted for this requirement under number 05-3K06-083 and is replaced with RFP 06-3K06-007.

This solicitation is being issued as full and open competition.  The applicable NAICS code is 541110 and size standard for this requirement is $6 Million.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.

Amendment 5 - Clarifies amendment 4 Evaluation and award decision information.  The first sentence below is revised by changing “in” to “of”.   The change is in BOLD letters.  

Factors number 1 and 2 above are of equal importance. Factor 3 will not be point scored, however, it is important and will be considered in the award decision.  Technical merit is more important than price in determining contract award.  All evaluation factors other than price, when combined are significantly more important than price.  The Contracting Officer shall determine what trade-off between technical merit and price promises to be the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  As offeror’s technical proposals become more equal, price may become the determining factor.  Contract award will be made to the proposal that offers the greatest value and is most advantageous to the Government.

<DESC>This is Amendment 04 for the N62645-06-R-0009, Infant Security System for NMCSD, providing clarification on a few concerns as per below.

This Amendment also hereby extends the closing date until 1500 (3:00 P.M.) EST 13 February 2006.

1. Your new statement of work in the access control section states that you now require Biometric readers - Questions:
 
a. Are you looking for these to replace the keypads or card swipes that were currently being interfaced to?
ANS: Vendor must install Biometric readers without regard for existing keypads/ cardswipes. Existing keypads/cardswipes shall be removed in accordance with the specifications.

b. Are these going to be existing readers that will be in place that we are just interfacing to?
ANS: Vendor shall install Biometric Readers.
 
c. You state they are to record who bypassed every time - is this to be on our computer or on your access control system computer?
ANS: Recording shall be performed by a component of the installed system.
 
d. What is the name, make and model of the biometric system that you are either installing or looking for us to install?
ANS: The government is not specifying any name, make, or model that the vendor shall install.
 
e. What type of biometrics are we talking about - finger, retinal, palm - please clarify?
ANS: Vendor shall propose any Biometric reader that meets the requirements of this performance specification, and propose a solution based upon available technology.

2. Reviewing the conduit guide lines, are we to mount conduit everywhere the low voltage cat 5 is to go or can we utilize cable trays and J hooks where possible to cut down on the labor and expense of the system - or is the conduit required only for 110 volt electrical.
ANS: Wires that run down must be encased in conduit.

3. Is there a specific electrical company that has to be utilized for installing the 110 volt power?
ANS: NMCSD does not have a specified electrical company. Choice of subcontractors is contractor responsibility.
