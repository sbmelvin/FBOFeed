Accordingly, this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) invites eligible institutions, partners, and groups of investigators to form consortia capable of mounting a sustained and innovative research and education effort in the specific area of Behavioral and Social Aspects of Terrorism and Counter-Terrorism. Respondents to this BAA should be cognizant of the fact that the Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security is a mission-driven program dealing with the security of the U.S. on weapons of mass destruction, disruption and effect. Consequently, outcomes derived from the research and education of this center should emphasize applications related to domestic security while reflecting on the international context of terrorism. Further, approaches to develop the future intellectual capital and workforce necessary to respond to the challenges raised in this BAA should be broadly integrated across all lines of research.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) 04-35 ADVANCED SPEECH ENCODING PROGRAM, CLOSING DATE: 05 JUL 2005, FIRST SELECTIONS: 4:00PM Arlington, VA Local Time, 01 SEP 2004, POC: Dr. Lisa Porter DARPA/ATO, E-MAIL: ase@darpa.mil, WEB: http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/ASE/index.htm.     PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA for Phase 2 of its Advanced Speech Encoding (ASE) Program. The objective of the ASE Program Phase 2 is to achieve ultra-low bit rate (ULBR) voice encoding (300 bps) with acceptable intelligibility, quality, and aural speaker recognizability in acoustically harsh environments. It is believed that novel noise-immune sensors will enable this capability. The ASE Program Phase 2 will also explore and characterize the nature of subauditory (nonacoustic) speech and its potential utility as an alternative means of communication in acoustically harsh environments. SCOPE AND FUNDING: The government anticipates multiple awards. Total program funding for this BAA is currently estimated at the following amounts: $0.8M for FY04, $7.5M for FY05, $7.0M for FY06, $3.25M for FY07 and $1.25M for FY08. NOTE: Although this BAA will be open for one (1) year from the date of its publication in FedBizOpps and FedGrants, the Government anticipates the majority of funding for this program will be committed during First Selections. To be considered for funding during First Selections, proposals must be received no later than 4:00PM Arlington, VA Local Time on 01 SEP 2004. EVALUATION CRITERIA: Proposers choosing to respond to this BAA will be evaluated against the following six (6) criteria: 1) Proposer's Understanding of the Problem and Scope of Technical Effort, 2) Relevance to DARPA Mission, 3) Soundness of Proposer's Technical and Management Approach, Including Teaming, 4) Relevant Experience, 5) Schedule, and 6) Cost Realism. Agency evaluators will consider criteria 1, 2, and 3 (Proposer's Understanding of the Problem and Scope of the Technical Effort, Relevance to DARPA Mission, and Soundness of Proposer's Technical and Management Approach, Including Teaming) as more important than the remaining criteria, 4, 5, and 6 (Relevant Experience, Schedule, and Cost Realism). Criteria 1, 2, and 3 are weighted in descending order of importance.  Criteria 4, 5, and 6 are equally weighted.  ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE: Proposers choosing to respond to this BAA must read the attached Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) which provides specific information about this BAA, including instructions on how to respond.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration has a need to contract for legal advisory services for the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program. Pursuant to the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1998 (TIFIA), Title I, Subtitle E, Chapter 1 of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), Public Law 105-178 (23 U.S.C. 181-189), the Department of Transportation (DOT) is authorized to provide credit assistance to major surface transportation projects  including secured (direct) loans, loan guarantees, and standby lines of credit to borrowers for major surface transportation projects and for up to 33% of eligible project costs.  Projects may include highway, transit, passenger rail and intermodal facilities.  Generally, under current law, project costs must equal or exceed $100 million. 

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), on behalf of DOT, seeks to award several legal counsel advisory task order contracts to law firms with municipal bond and private lender expertise, including project finance experience, (with renewal options to be exercised at the sole discretion of the DOT) to provide advice and assistance to the TIFIA Joint Program Office (JPO) and Departmental operating agency counsel in reviewing, drafting, negotiating and modifying credit instruments including:  term sheets, as well as secured (direct) loan agreements, guaranteed loan agreements, line of credit agreements, and related documents including, lease agreements, pledge documents,  bond indentures, hedge agreements and swap termination documents as well as intercreditor agreements to be entered into between the DOT and selected TIFIA borrowers and third parties as appropriate.  Counsel may also review, draft, and modify amendments or amended and restated agreements. The contract will be for an initial two-year period with three (3) one-year renewal options.

 The firms selected will: provide advice and counsel to the DOT in analyzing the legal aspects of the financing for the project; review and modify as appropriate opinion letters of borrowers’ counsel; and ensure that credit agreement terms, conditions, covenants, and remedies provide adequate security to the DOT, are appropriate for the particular transaction, and are consistent with the statutory criteria and the regulations implementing the TIFIA program. The firm will also review all loan closing documentation and be responsible for or represent as appropriate the TIFIA JPO at financial close (generally held simultaneously with senior creditors) and may from time to time be required to furnish legal memoranda which would be incorporated into a briefing memoranda making recommendations with regard to the execution of the TIFIA credit agreement by the Department.

The firm must be able to attend working conferences and meetings at DOT headquarters in Washington, D.C. on short notice as well as participate in telephone conference calls on short notice.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration has a need to contract for financial advisory services for the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program. Pursuant to the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1998 (TIFIA), Title I, Subtitle E, Chapter 1 of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), Public Law 105-178 (23 U.S.C. 181-189), the Department of Transportation (DOT) is authorized to provide credit assistance to major surface transportation projects, including secured (direct) loans, loan guarantees, and standby lines of credit to project sponsors (Borrowers) of major surface transportation projects for up to 33% of eligible project costs.  Projects may include highway, transit, passenger rail and intermodal facilities.  Generally, under current law, projects must cost at least $100 million.

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), on behalf of the DOT, seeks to award multiple financial advisory task order contracts to several qualified firms with project financial analysis expertise in the municipal bond and private lender sectors to assist the DOT in two phases of activity with respect to TIFIA loan applications. The contracts will be for an initial two-year period with three (3) one-year renewal options. -

Phase 1 (Project Evaluation):  Evaluate the soundness and creditworthiness of the applicant’s financial plan for the project; and

Phase 2 (Project Negotiation):  As part of a DOT team that includes DOT staff, attorneys and outside counsel, provide support in negotiating the financial terms of credit agreements to be entered into with Borrowers, for those projects selected to receive assistance.

Both phases will involve extensive financial analysis, including, but not limited to, the evaluation of proposed credit structures, calculation of debt service coverage ratios, development of alternative TIFIA debt repayment structures, review of feasibility studies, and provision of computer analysis and modeling support.

The firm must be able to attend working conferences and meetings at DOT headquarters in Washington, D.C. on short notice as well as participate in telephone conference calls on short notice.

It is anticipated that each contractor will be assigned one to three projects (task orders) to evaluate annually, depending upon the level of demand for program assistance.  For each project/task order, DOT will select one firm from among the multiple firms it retains to advise it on each transaction.  Although every project assigned to a contractor will involve the performance of work under Phase 1, the performance of work under Phase 2 will be limited to only those applicants selected by the DOT to receive TIFIA assistance.

Extensive information on the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) can be accessed through the websitehttp://www.tifia.fhwa.dot.gov/

The solicitation and all related documents and amendments, if any, will only be released and available electronically through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) web site at http://www1.eps.gov/spg/DOT/FHWA/postdate_1.html which will list all the FHWA business opportunities sorted by posted date.

The type of observations used in data set production include NOAA Northern Hemisphere Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) snow extent product; microwave snow maps of snow extent and depth are to be derived from a multispectral analysis of satellite data employing frequency gradients; station snow depth observations from U. S., Canadian, and when and where possible to obtain, from Eurasian and some Southern Hemisphere nations.  The geographic area to be covered includes the Northern and Southern Hemisphere continents.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  Procurement by less than full and open competition is necessary because of the unique capability of Rutgers University and its expertise regarding snow cover measurements to produce snow cover maps.

<DESC>Statement of Work:

 

The purpose of this statement of work is to evaluate the use of a geothermal heat pump system for survey for HQ AETC.  The geothermal system would implement a vertical closed loop heat exchanger.   A preliminary geological lithology log model will be simulated using available data from the state and other geological organizations to create a model.  The model will show the following:

·         the types of materials expected to be encountered 

·         an estimated average thermal conductivity for a 350’ vertical well based on those materials 

·         an average estimated static earth temperature across the well depth

·         thermal diffusivity for that same vertical well

 

METHODOLOGY:

 

The software used for simulating geological conditions is:

                                                                Rock Works 

                                                                Micro-Soft Excel                                                              

A professional Geologist has also been used to evaluate the lithology of the formation on site and evaluate the estimated thermal performance of the soils at different strata and the composite performance for the vertical closed loop.  He will also determine the estimated Static Water level and trends in its stability or effects on the thermal conductivity results.

<CONTACT>Mark Ross 850-235-5624 , or Contracting Officer Margie Dulatt at 850-235-5398.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Panama City, Florida,(NSWC-PC), formerly Coastal Systems Station (CSS), intends to award a sole&#64979;source contract to Foster Miller, Inc. (FMI) of Waltham MA for the continued development and support of crawling autonomous vehicles through 30 September 2005. It is anticipated (based on the results of testing in Spring 04), that NSWC-PC will desire to utilize these same vehicles to support autonomous mine neutralization in the Surf Zone (SZ) and Very Shallow Water (VSW) area. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons: The VSW/SZ Mine Counter Measures (MCM) Program will enter its 7th year in FY05. Under guidance from the Office of Naval Research (ONR) the mission priority of the surf zone effort has shifted toward non-exhaustive lane reconnaissance and Reacquire-Id-Neutralize ( RIN) missions, instead of the exhaustive mapping mission. To this end contract N61331-99-C-0022 was awarded to FMI based on a proposal submitted under CSS Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 99-001.  During the life of this contract, the maturity of the FMI vehicles has increased. The FY 05 effort will focus on: (1) Designing, developing, and fabricating a small autonomous vehicle, capable of basic navigation and communications functions based on the SEA TALON design developed under Contract N61331-99-C-0022.  The vehicle will be large enough to carry a payload of up to 20 pounds of explosives, along with the Safe and Arming Device and the Remote Control Detonator; (2) Designing, developing, and fabricating a delivery system capable of releasing a 20-pound item from the Sea Talon upon command; and (3) Conducting two fleet demonstrations of these capabilities during Fiscal Year 2005 Only Foster Miller, Inc, as the incumbent on contract N61331-99-C-0022, has the in-depth knowledge of the vehicle design to successfully accomplish this requirement.  The SEA Talon vehicle is based on a design originally developed by FMI for land based Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) applications. Although NSWC-PC will obtain a final design package of the SEA Talon at the completion of this effort, currently there is no adequate description of the vehicle design that would allow a competitor to adequately perform this effort.  This is a follow-on effort for the continued development of a highly specialized system within the exact meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). Award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government in the approximate amount of $4,000,000 expended to date under contract that could not feasibly be recovered through c ompetition.  Numbered Note 22 applies.  NAICS Code 541710 applies. SBA Size Standard is $5.0M. FSC is 1075.

<DESC>The Department of Housing and Urban Development seeks a Contractor to provide Technical Assistance for the Community Connections (ComCon) Information Center for the Office of Community Planning and Development (CPD).  

The description of the services is the following: The Community Connections Information Center of CPD (ComCon) serves the clients of HUD/CPD programs by providing a variety of services, including special projects, in conjunction with very high priority objectives which pertain to programs, policies and issues of great interest to the customers of CPD and the Department.  The role of Community Connections is to cover all of the major CPD programs, to occasionally support the activities of the Office of the Assistant Secretary and other HUD offices in the areas of, but not limited to, renewal communities, affordable housing, community and economic development, homelessness, rural housing, and consolidated planning.  CPD requires a contractor to design and carry out the various aspects of short-term and long-term information sharing and Technical Assistance (TA) projects through a variety of media, including computer networks, electronic bulletin boards, publications, brochures, conferences, videos, training films, distance learning, fax, automatic fax/voice mail systems, publications, and public information projects, as well as other innovative and traditional methods of dissemination.  The Contractor shall also develop appropriate survey materials, management plans, data collection instruments, material production systems, computer program designs, etc.  Additionally, the Contractor will serve as an Administrative Coordinator and as such will be responsible for coordinating various services with three firms.  These firms provide the following services: (1) logistical conference planning, (2) mailing list management, and (3) retrieval and dissemination (warehouse). 

The resultant contract will be subject to the statutory limitation of the use of HOME funds as provided in 42 U.S.C. Sec. 12783.  HOME funds will constitute approximately 80% of the funding per year of this contract.  HOME funds shall not provide more than 20% of a firm’s operating budget in any one year.  Therefore, a firm must be able to certify, on an annual basis, that funds obligated under the resultant contract constitute less than 20% of the firm’s overall operating budget (revenue). Operating budget is defined as “an annual budget that includes all anticipated income and expenses.  Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles it would be all income and expense items.”  This definition is consistent with its usage by the Internal Revenue Service, the General Accounting Office, and other Federal agencies.  

The period of performance will be for one year from the date of award with two one (1) year options.  This is a full and open competition.  The resultant contract will be subject to strict subcontracting goals.  HUD’s subcontracting goals for small business concerns for this requirement will be 45%.  Offerors will be required to submit a subcontracting plan that will be subject to approval by the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU). The solicitation will be available on or about June 1, 2004.     The closing date for receipt of offers will be addressed therein.     Interested parties may obtain a copy of the solicitation by accessing the following website: http://www.hud.gov/offices/cpo/contract.cfm.     The Solicitation will not be released via hard copy from HUD.  HUD posts all required notices of its contracting opportunities, including all amendments, on this website. You may subscribe to the HUD Contracting Opportunities Mailing List, which is available on the above website or on FedBizOpps, to receive notification of the release of the RFP and any amendments.

Statement of Work/background & Needs- Heterosexual transmission causes more than 85 percent of the HIV infections worldwide and a rapidly increasing proportion of HIV/AIDS cases reported in the United States.  In 2000 worldwide, 4.7 million adults ages 15-49 acquired HIV infection, 2.2 million (47 percent) of them women (UNAIDS 2000).  Despite gains in male condom use over the past 20 years, many women find that their partners are unwilling to use condoms consistently.

 In the U.S., the consequences of these behaviors and attitudes are reflected in continuing HIV transmission, with increasing concentration among women.  In 2002, women accounted for 26 percent of reported adult AIDS cases and in the 30 areas that also report HIV infection without AIDS, 28 percent of reported HIV infections occurred in women, 39 percent among those ages 13-24 (CDC 2003).  

These trends reinforce the importance of identifying and testing new prevention methods for heterosexual women and men.  In the past few years, much effort has gone into developing methods which can be used in combination with other prevention interventions for protection against HIV infection. Several promising microbicides, chemical compounds which can be applied topically and which inactivate or kill HIV, have been identified in laboratory and animal studies (Van Damme 2000, Rosenstein 1998, Coggins 2000, Piret 2000, Manson 2000). Several studies have indicated that women (and their male partners) would use a microbicide if it were shown to protect against HIV infection (Darroch 1999, Blanchard 1998, Bentley 1998, Bentley 2000, Hammett 2000).

Cellulose Acetate Phathalate (CAP), a compound which has long been used as a drug excipient, has been formulated into a gel that may be applied topically to the vagina for prevention of sexual transmission of HIV-1.  Preclinical studies have demonstrated promising anti-HIV activity and low toxicity of this formulation.  The New York Blood Center, Inc. (NYBC) is the sole holder of the rights to development of UC-781 as a topically applied microbicide.

CAP was selected for the clinical trials described in this document through an open, competitive process.  This process was initiated through an announcement soliciting collaboration from entities holding interest in potential anti-HIV topical Microbicides which appeared in the Federal Register in June, 2001.  Proposals were received for a total of five different agents which were tested by CDC laboratory scientists for in vitro toxicity and anti-HIV activity.  CAP was selected for clinical trial based upon its favorable performance in these in vitro studies.

<DESC>SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES

DATE: JULY 6, 2004

REQUISITION NO: 04M000182
INTENDED SOURCE: VIRGINIA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION, INC. (VPCA)

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: DATE OF AWARD THROUGH TWELVE MONTHS

PURPOSE:

THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN  SERVICES,  SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION, THROUGH THE PROGRAM SUPPORT CENTER, PLANS TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION TO PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION, INC. (VPCA). CLOSING DATE IS JULY 20 , 2002.


THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROCUREMENT IS AS FOLLOWS:

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PURCHASE ORDER IS TO EXPAND THE WORK INITIATED BY THE VIRGINIA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION UNDER THE HRSA/SSAMHSA MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SUMMIT INITIATIVE.  THIS INITIATIVE INTRODUCED THE INTEGRATION OF PHYSICAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WITHIN EIGHT COMMUNITY SETTINGS, LOCATED IN THE FIVE HEALTH PLANNING REGIONS OF THE STATE OF VIRGINIA, WITH A FOCUS ON REACHING THE RURAL HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM BY INTRODUCING SCREENING AND BRIEF INTERVENTION FOR PROVIDERS WHO PROVIDE SERVICES TO PEOPLE WITH SUBSTANCE USE PROBLEMS IN THE RURAL HEALTH CARE SETTING.  THE RURAL POPULATION AND THE PROVIDERS WHO SERVE THESE PATIENTS REACH A DISTINCT REGION OF THE STATE AS WELL AS DISTINCT SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION.  

UNDER AN EARLIER PURCHASE ORDER NAMED, "SUBSTANCE ABUSE:  INFORMATION FOR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS" WAS DEVELOPED AND DELIVERED TO PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS THROUGH A SERIES OF  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE RESOURCES TO THE RURAL PRIMARY CARE COMMUNITY THROUGH REGIONAL TRAINING SESSIONS.  THE NEED FOR THESE RESOURCES AND TRAINING IS DOCUMENTED IN THE REPORT, "SHORTAGES OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL IN VIRGINIA."   THE IMPLEMENTATION AND DELIVERY OF BOTH THE TRAINING SESSIONS AND COLLABORATIVE TRAINING MATERIALS ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES, INCLUDING THE INTRODUCTION AND TEACHING SURROUNDING SCREENING AND BRIEF INTERVENTION, HAVE STARTED TO FILL AN ARTICULATED GAP IN SERVICE DELIVERY OF EVIDENCE-BASED SERVICES IN RURAL VIRGINIA. 

IN HEALTH CARE, SCREENING REFERS TO THE PROCESS DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE WHO HAVE OR ARE AT RISK FOR HAVING AN ILLNESS OR DISORDER.  THE PURPOSE OF SCREENING IS TO TARGET PERSONS FOR INTERVENTION AND OR TREATMENT IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE LONG-TERM MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SCREENING.    BY INTERVENING EARLY AND RAISING THE INDIVIDUALS' CONCERN ABOUT THE RISK FACTORS FOR SUBSTANCE USE RELATED PROBLEMS, IT IS EXPECTED THAT SCREENING FOR DRUG AND ALCOHOL PROBLEMS IN THE COMMUNITY SETTING MAY REDUCE SUBSEQUENT USE.  SOME TYPES OF CLINICAL APPROACHES, FOR EXAMPLE, BRIEF INTERVENTION, MAY ALSO BE DELIVERED TO THE PATIENT IN THE PRIMARY CARE BY TRAINED STAFF.     

IN 2003-2004, THE INTRODUCTION OF  SCREENING AND BRIEF INTERVENTION TECHNOLOGY TO THE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS IN THE RURAL POPULATION WAS IMPLEMENTED IN THE FIVE REGIONAL HEALTH PLANNING AREAS OF VIRGINIA DURING EIGHT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WORKSHOPS BY THE VIRGINIA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION. THE RESULTS INCLUDE AN INCREASED DEMAND FOR FURTHER DISSEMINATION OF THIS TRAINING AND MATERIALS TO INCREASE THE KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICE BASE OF SCREENING AND BRIEF INTERVENTION TECHNOLOGY WITHIN THE RURAL COMMUNITY BY PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. LARGE SYSTEMS OF RURAL CARE, INCLUDING THE HEALTH CARE FOR THE HOMELESS AND COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER SYSTEMS, WHICH HAS HAD SOME MEMBERS TRAINED IN SCREENING AND BRIEF  INTERVENTION TECHNOLOGY  IN 2003/2004, HAVE CALLED FOR MORE TRAINING AND RESOURCE DISSEMINATION TO INCREASE PROVIDER KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICE.   THIS CALL FOR ACTION, BY THE RURAL PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER COMMUNITY, HAS PROPOSED RESTRUCTURING THE SCHEDULE AND LOCATION OF THE 2004-2005 TRAININGS TO TAKE PLACE IN LARGE PRIMARY CARE SYSTEMS TO REACH THE ENTIRE PRACTICE BASE, SO THAT ALL MEMBERS OF THE PRIMARY CARE TEAM ARE INTRODUCED TO SCREENING AND BRIEF INTERVENTION TRAINING AND MATERIALS AT THE SAME TIME, WITH THE SAME TECHNOLOGY TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE SAME SETTING.  REQUESTS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR TRAINING IN THE EVENINGS TO ACCOMMODATE PATIENT SCHEDULING AND TO MINIMIZE DISRUPTION TO PATIENT SCHEDULING AND THE DELIVERY OF CARE.         

THE VPCA WILL CONSULT WITH EACH PARTICIPATING CLINIC AS TO THE OPTIMAL MECHANISM TO MEET THEIR NEEDS FOR EACH PRIMARY CARE TEAM TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE TA MATERIALS.  THIS WILL PROVIDE EACH SITE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MULTIPLE STAFF IN THE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER TEAM TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE TA AND COLLABORATIVE MATERIALS IN THE FORMAT DEFINED BY THE PROVIDER.   THOSE PARTICIPATING IN THE 2003-2004 MADE THIS REQUEST WHILE UNDERSCORING THE VALUE OF HAVING ACCESS TO THE MATERIALS AS A RESOURCE IN VARIOUS FORMATS.         

TASK 1:  THE CONTRACTOR WILL MEET WITH THE GOVERNMENT PROJECT OFFICER (GPO) AND OTHER  APPROPRIATE STAFF AT THE CENTER FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT 9CSAT) IDENTIFIED BY THE GPO, IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE BEST APPROACH FOR ACCOMPLISHING THE TASKS COVERED BY THIS PURCHASE ORDER.  THIS MEETING MAY TAKE PLACE EITHER IN PERSON OR VIA CONFERENCE CALL.   

TASK 2:  BASED ON THE RESULTS OF TASK 1, THE CONTRACTOR WILL PROVIDE CSAT WITH AN ACTION PLAN FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, DESCRIBING HOW THE VCPA WILL IDENTIFY THE SPECIFIC INTENDED AUDIENCES AND NUMBERS OF THE PRACTITIONERS AND PRACTICES WHICH COMPRISE THE RURAL MEMBERSHIP OF THE VIRGINIA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION AND HEALTH CARE FOR THE HOMELESS PROGRAMS IN THE RURAL AREAS TO REACH THE UNDERSERVED POPULATION.  THE CSAT GPO WILL REVIEW AND APPROVE THIS PLAN AND THE CONTRACTOR WILL SERVE TO SECURE APPROVAL AND TRANSMIT APPROPRIATE DOCUMENTATION TO CSAT BEFORE INITIATING ACTIVITIES.  THE PLAN WILL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ORGANIZATION, THE GEOGRAPHIC REGION AND ITS POPULATION OF PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS AS WELL THE PATIENTS SERVED IN THIS REGION.    

TASK 3:  THE CONTRACTOR WILL BUILD UPON THE MATERIALS DEVELOPED, PRODUCED AND DISSEMINATED THE PREVIOUS YEAR WITH REVISIONS REFLECTING FEEDBACK FROM THE USERS AND APPROVED BY THE PROJECT OFFICER.  THE NUMBER OF TYPES OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE MATERIALS PRODUCED WILL BE CONSISTENT WITH THE NUMBER OF PERSON TO RECEIVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AS SPECIFIED IN THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PLAN.  

TASK 4:  THE CONTRACTOR WILL DETERMINE COLLABORATIVELY WITH EACH SITE HOW MATERIALS CAN BE UTILIZED FOR COMPLEMENTARY TA WITH EACH SITE AND AS FOR REFERENCE MATERIALS BY THE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER.  THIS WILL FURTHER INCREASE DIFFUSION OF THE TECHNOLOGY AMONG PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS.  OFTEN MORE THAN ONE MEMBER OF THE PROVIDER TEAM REQUIRES ACCESS TO THE MATERIALS.  VPCA WILL WORK WITH EACH PRIMARY CARE SITE TO DETERMINE THE MOST USABLE FORMAT FOR THE MATERIALS IN EACH PARTICIPATING SITE. THIS WILL BOTH EXPAND THE ACCESSIBILITY OF THE MATERIALS AND THEREFORE THE SCREENING AND BRIEF INTERVENTION TECHNOLOGY.   

TASK 5:  THE CONTRACTOR WILL IDENTIFY THE PROVIDERS TO RECEIVE THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND WILL PROPOSE THE NUMBER OF MEETING, METHODS, LOCATIONS, AND DATES AT WHICH THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WILL BE PROVIDED.   A LISTING OF ALL TRAININGS/EVENTS AND THE PROVIDERS REACHED WILL BE SUBMITTED TO THE GPO FOR APPROVAL.   

TASK 6:  THE CONTRACTOR WILL PREPARE A SUMMARY OF THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE EVENTS, DESCRIBING THE OUTCOMES, AND HIGHLIGHTING ANY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND YEARS.  THE REPORT WILL INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF COLLABORATIVE TRAINING MATERIALS DISSEMINATED, THE NUMBER OF ATTENDEES REACHED, RESPONSES OF THE RECIPIENTS OF THE MATERIALS AND TRAINING. 

TASK 7:  THE CONTRACTOR WILL PROVIDE CSAT WITH MONTHLY REPORTS ON TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ACTIVITIES AND A FINAL REPORT ON THE PROJECT. 


SOLE SOURCE DETERMINATION IS BASED UPON THE FOLLOWING:

SINCE 1980, THE VIRGINIA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION (VPCA) HAS WORKED WITH VIRGINIA'S COMMUNITIES AND PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS, AS DEMONSTRATED IN THE WORK IMPLEMENTED ON BEHALF OF CSAT IN 2003-2004, TO BRING PRIMARY CARE TO THE RURAL, UNDERSERVED AND AGING POPULATION GROUPS RESIDING IN VIRGINIA. IT HAS NOW DEVELOPED AN AREA OF EXPERTISE AND SKILLS RECOGNIZED BY THE PRIMARY CARE COMMUNITY AND DENTAL COMMUNITY TO PROVIDE SCREENING AND BRIEF INTERVENTION TRAINING AND MATERIALS IN VIRGINIA. 

THROUGH ITS WORK IN SCREENING AND BRIEF INTERVENTION, THE VPCA HAS FURTHER ESTABLISHED ITSELF IN THE STATE AS AN OPINION LEADER AND CENTRAL POINT FOR THE PRIMARY COMMUNITY TO ENSURE THAT PROVIDER COMMUNITY HAS ACCESS TO THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY WHICH RESULT IN ACCESS TO IMPROVED PATIENT SERVICES. VPCA'S HISTORY OF WORKING IN AND COLLABORATING WITH VIRGINIA'S RURAL AND GROWING AGING POPULATION.  BOTH POPULATIONS ARE SERVED BY THE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER WHO HAVE DOCUMENTED SUBSTANCE USE INTERVENTION NEEDS IN THE PRIMARY CARE SETTING, WHICH HAS BEEN THE FOCUS OF ITS 2003-2004 EFFORT.  THEIR ONGOING RELATIONSHIP AND KNOWLEDGE WITH BOTH THE HOMELESS AND CHC'S POOR AND RURAL POPULATION IS CRUCIAL TO THE FURTHER DIFFUSION OF THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE MATERIALS AND TRAINING WHICH ARE HIGHLY RELEVANT TO THE PROVIDER AND TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SCREENING AND BRIEF INTERVENTION. 

TOO OFTEN THE AREA OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE IS OVERLOOKED OR NOT ADDRESSED IN THE PRIMARY CARE SETTING.  VPCA'S LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE AREA SERVES TO DISTINGUISH THE VPCA IN ITS CAPACITY TO ASSESS AND FILL THE GAP FOR PROVIDERS IN THIS CRITICAL AREA IN THE RURAL SETTING.  THEIR LEADERSHIP AMONG RURAL POPULATION'S PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER GROUP HAS AFFORDED THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO BOTH WORK WITH AND HEAR THE NEEDS OF THE PROVIDER AS REFLECTED IN THIS PROPOSAL.   GREATER EXPERTISE IN THE AREA OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE SCREENING AND BRIEF INTERVENTION TECHNOLOGY IS NOW ASSOCIATED WITH THE VPCA. BECAUSE OF ITS UNIQUE RELATIONSHIP WITH ITS MEMBERS, AND BY LISTENING TO ITS MEMBERS, IT HAS BECOME ACCEPTABLE TO IMPLEMENT TA WITHIN THE PRIMARY CARE SETTING ITSELF AND TO TAILOR THE COLLABORATIVE MATERIALS TO EACH PARTICIPATING SITE.  PRESENTING TA WITHIN THE SETTING WHERE PRIMARY CARE PRACTICES TAKES PLACE IS A BIG STEP FORWARD.   BY DOING SO, THE STRATEGY AND TECHNIQUE ARE FURTHER DIFFUSED AND CUSTOMIZED TO REACH THE PRACTITIONER WITHIN THE CLINIC SETTING, AND THE POPULATION SERVED IN THE RURAL SETTING.  


THE VA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION HAS AN ONGOING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ADDITIONAL PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS WHO WILL BE REACHED AND ARE IN NEED OF THIS TECHNOLOGY AND ITS ASSOCIATED SCREENING AND BRIEF INTERVENTION TRAINING. THROUGH EARLIER TRAINING EFFORTS AND DIFFUSION OF INNOVATION AMONG  RURAL VIRGINIA PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS THE WORD IS OUT THAT THE VA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION'S IS A SOURCE OF TESTED EXPERTISE IN SCREENING AND BRIEF INTERVENTION NEEDS WITHIN  BOTH THE RURAL PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER AND PATIENT POPULATIONS.




THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION IS FOR SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT
INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE (FAR 6.302-1).  A DETERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT. CONTRACTORS MAY FORWARD CAPABILITY STATEMENTS TO THE REFERENCED ADDRESS.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>It is the intent of the NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division, Orlando, FL to solicit and   award a sole source Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract of less than $500,000.00 to Northrop Grumman (NG) Defense Mission Systems, (55 John Clarke Road, Middletown, RI), under statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), set forth in FAR 6.302-1(d)(2), titled, “only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements”.  The Government intends to enhance the 14E35 Generic Reconfigurable Training System  (GRTS), SQQ-89 Sonar Suite Basic Operator Trainer (BOT) at Fleet Anti Submarine Warfare Training Center  (FASW), San Diego, CA.  This sole source award is based on the following: 

1.  Budget Risk:  The available funds are limited and will not allow for learning curve costs.  The award must be in a FFP vehicle, any other vendor must accept this type of contract.
2.  Schedule Risk:  The time frame of the FFP vehicle is limited as result of bullet #1 and the urgent needs of FASW.  The original contractor has unique knowledge and personnel assets enabling them to achieve this goal of generating the necessary enhancements within the necessary timeframe of less than eight months.
3.  Interoperability Risk: The application currently runs on the CTTAS© simulation engine, a NG Licensed product.   While a third party can legally perform changes to the GRTS student applications, NG’s familiarity with the interface requirements and ability to alter the simulation engine if required, affords the government the best value in this situation.  Unless a vendor possesses a simulation engine that can easily interface with the existing applications, and can perform the upgrades, and can provide a free site license, these requirements will incur cost that will exceed the available budget.
4.  Subject Matter Expertise.  NG performed the training analysis for this trainer, and possesses instructional design specialists and subject matter experts that are already familiar with this system and the requirements of the customer, this expertise significantly reduces risk and confusion, thus saving time and effort.
5.  ATAS database Risk:  The 14E35 BOT requires the capability to interface and work with the Government Acoustic Training and Simulation Database (ATaS) executable files, or similar database and audio generation executable that meets the fidelity requirements of a dynamic parametric acoustic audio database capable of multi-mode, multi-shaft surface and subsurface contacts.  NG has demonstrated success with this task, and will require neither learning curve nor new database expertise.

In summary, it would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to offer a compatible product that would meet these requirements in the time specified.  Interested firms may submit their capabilities and qualifications to the identified point of contact not later than 15 July 2004 3: 00 P.M. local time.     Such capabilities and qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.     A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.    This is not a request for quotes, and this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SUBJECT>Y--Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Multiple Award Task Order Contracts in support of AMC and other DoD Agencies
<SOLNBR>W912BU-04-R-0022
<RESPDATE>082604
<ARCHDATE>10252004
<CONTACT>Denise  DeTitta, 215-656-6775
<DESC>This procurement consists of one solicitation with the intent of awarding up to eight (8) firm fixed price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs) for Design-Build Plus services for a broad range of  various military facilities, primarily in support of the Air Mobility Command and other DoD agencies (military and civilian) to be used CONUS, Hawaii and Alaska. The anticipated contracts will be firm fixed price and work performed will be primarily desig n and construction of military facilities such as administrative, training, operations and recreation under the NAICS code 2365220, Commercial and Industrial Building Construction (small business size standard of $28.5 million).  It is the GovernmentÃ¢Â€Â™ s intent to issue one solicitation for award of up to eight (8) contracts (three (3) Competitive HubZone and five (5) unrestricted) creating two separate multiple award contractor pools.  HubZone Small businesses can compete for the unrestricted awards and  be considered for more than one category.  Contractor may not receive more than one award.  HubZone small business must provide a copy of their HubZone certification. As part of the evaluation process, all offerors must show proof of their bonding capacit y.  Bonding limits are as follows:  Unrestricted:  Single Task order $80,000,000.00 and concurrent task order $250,000,000.00; and HubZone:  Single Task Order $20,000,000.00 and concurrent task order $100,000,000.00.  If the offeror cannot demonstrate suff icient bonding capacity as described above, your proposal will not be considered. Each contract awarded as a result of this solicitation will include a base period of 24 months and three 1-year option periods; for a total contract duration not to exceed 60  months.  Anticipated program ceiling for this acquisition is $5 B ($4.7B unrestricted and $300,000,000.000 Competitive HubZone). Total dollar value of all task orders placed on all contracts awarded will not exceed the total program value for each contrac tor pool. To preclude the need to resolicit, if three contracts cannot be awarded to HubZone firms, the total combined contract capacity of $5B will be distributed by one, or a combination of two methods:  (1) equally distributed to the five successful unr estricted contractors, or (2) make an additional competitive award to a sixth unrestricted contractor.  The task order limitations are as follows:  Unrestricted:  $10,000.00 minimum and $80,000,000.00 maximum; HubZone:  $10,000.00 minimum and $20,000,000.0 0 maximum.  The guaranteed minimum for each contract is $10,000.00, which may be met by award of a task order in an equivalent amount.  Each contract will remain active:  (1) unless the contractor performs unsatisfactorily on a task order; (2) until contra ct expiration, (3) until task order completion; or (4) until the total contract capacity limit is reached.  It is anticipated that any remaining capacity for awarded contracts with documented unsatisfactory performance may be distributed among the remainin g contractors with a record of satisfactory performance.  For estimating purposes only, each of the five (5) unrestricted contractorÃ¢Â€Â™s estimated maximum per one-year contract is $188,000,000.00, and each of the HubZone competitive contractorÃ¢Â€Â™s es timated maximum per one year contract period is $20,000,000.00.  However, each unrestricted contractor has the opportunity to receive award amounts up to the estimated unrestricted total of $4.7B.  Likewise each HubZone competitive contractor has the oppor tunity to receive awards up to the estimated HubZone total contract capacity of $300,000,000.00.  After award of the contracts, unrestricted contractors will not compete with the HubZone contractors for award of individual task orders.  In determining whic h contractor pool to solicit for a given task order requirement, consideration may be given to (1) complexity of the work, (2) past performance of the contracto r, (3) contract task order limitation, (4) on-going work, (5) bonding capacity and any other task order specific requirement.  The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation.  Awards will be made using best value sourc e selection procedures. The Government will award the contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offerors whose proposals, conforming to the RFP will be the Best Value to the Government.  Best Value will be determined using a Trade off p rocess, comparing price, technical and other factors.  It is the GovernmentÃ¢Â€Â™s intent to award based on initial offers received, without discussions.  The award may be made to a superior offeror which is not the lowest offered priced, but which is sign ificantly more technically advantageous than the lowest offer so as to justify the payment of a higher price.  The evaluation factors are: (1) Mission Capability, (2) Past Performance, (3) Proposal Risk, (4) Cost/Price and (5) Bonding Capacity.  Mission Ca pability (Factor 1) and Past Performance (Factor 2) are of equal importance.  Proposal Risk (Factor 3) is slightly less important than Factors 1 and 2.  Cost/Price (Factor 4) is slightly less important than Factor 3.  Factor 5, Bonding is a Go/No Go factor  and is, therefore, not weighted. In accordance with FAR 15.304(e), Factors 1, 2, and 3 when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price; however, cost/price will contribute substantially to the selection decision. As part of the submitta l, offerors will be required to submit technical and cost/price proposals for a hypothetical project (not including site work) as described in a sample task order which will be included in the Request for Proposal. Consideration will be given to prime firm s, joint ventures, partnerships, and their subcontractors or consultants who have the resources and capability to provide Constructability Review and Design-Build Services. Selected firms will be expected to work closely with CENAP and Installation project  managers and Installation Administrative Contracting Officers.  Once the contracts are awarded, the Government will compete the work among the awardees based on performance and other factors set forth in the contract and the Request for Proposal.  Each aw ardee will be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for subsequent task orders, except under those circumstances described in FAR 16.505(b)(2).   The Request For Proposal package will be available for your viewing at the following address: https://e bs.nap.usace.army.mil on or after issue date of the solicitation.  The official media of distribution for this solicitation is WEB-ONLY.  No written or faxed requests will be accepted.  Interested contractors should register on the web page.

<CONTACT>JOANNE LOWE PURCHASING AGENT 7036487392     JLOWE@USGS.GOV;
<DESC>The US Geological Survey (USGS) has a requirement for a high-speed connectivity to and membership in Mid Atlantic Crossroads (MAX), also called the Next Generation Internet East Coast Exchange Point (NGIX-East) University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland.  MAX is a non-profit network collaboration of educational, research and government organizations.  The MAX provides high speed connectivity to the Internet2 Abilene Network (Abilene) operated by the University Corporation for Advanced Internet Development (UCAID) that connects other educational and research networks world wide.  The MAX is the only connection in the mid-Atlantic region providing connectivity to these networks.  The University of Maryland is the only source of access to the Mid-Atlantic Crossroads.  Due to this limited availability, this requirement will be met through a sole source purchase order for four months as an interim for a contract with the University of Maryland. This service will be utilized by the USGS scientific community for collaborative information exchanges with other scientific and research organizations.  Based on the information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253( c ) (1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the government considers the service specified as a sole source from the University of Maryland.  Should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required service are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and other information/material which corresponds to the requirement. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  This notice represents the Governments only official notice for this procurement. This is not a commercial item procurement, see numbered note 26.  Also, see numbered note 22. THIS ACQUISITION WILL BE MADE UNDER THE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION THRESHOLD OF $100,000.00.  NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541618.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration, Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), 6500 S. MacArthur Blvd., Oklahoma City, OK, intends to establish a Qualified Vendors List (QVL) to be used for fabricating corrugated plastic shipping containers.  To be considered for inclusion on the QVL, the following minimum qualification requirements of this initial Screening Information Request (SIR) must be met.  Provided as an example are photographs of a corrugated plastic shipping container (Attachments 2-6).  Corrugated plastic shipping containers will be procured on an as-needed basis.  Dimensions will vary and will be specified in the purchase description when the requirement for a container arises. (A) The QVL is a 100 percent set-aside for small business concerns. The FAA Acquisition Management System defines a small business as, â€œâ€¦a business, including itâ€™s affiliates, that is independently owned and operated and not dominant in producing or performing the supplies or services being purchased, and one that qualifies as a small business under the Federal Governmentâ€™s criteria and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) size standards.â€  For this procurement, vendors must be classified as a small business under NAICS code 322211 (500 employees).  Vendors shall complete and submit the Business Declaration Form (Attachment 1) with required documentation.   (B) Vendors shall submit a description of their capability to meet the following four criteria:   (1) Manufacturing Capabilities â€“ fabrication and manufacturing of corrugated plastic shipping containers;  (2) Past Performance on Government Contracts â€“ provide contract number(s) and name and phone number of point(s) of contact.  The FAA reserves the right to contact references and verify each vendorâ€™s information;  (3) Computer Aid Design (CAD) Capabilities â€“ capability in-house or have sources for software and firmware needs; and  (4) Inventory - sufficient space for storage of drawings (physical and computer). To receive consideration, all documentation required in the previous paragraphs must be provided, along with a name and telephone number of a point of contact, to the following address:  FAA/MMAC, P.O. Box 25082, Oklahoma City, OK 73125, Attn:  Joy Dickson, AMQ-210, with reference made to Qualified Vendors List File #64-1, by July 28, 2004.  If required, a subsequent SIR will provide further qualification criteria to enable the FAA to evaluate and then down-select vendors for the QVL.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE.  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, ALOSH, Morgantown, WV requires analysis services for cultural fungi analysis  for its Division of Safety Research.

This proposed contract action announces the Governments intent to issue a purchase order, on a sole-source basis in accordance with FAR 302-1(b)(1)(i), to Environmental Microbiological Laboratory, Daly City, CA.  This purchase order is to conduct Phase II of the NORA study, Work Related Asthma in School and Office Buildings.  Changing laboratories at this time could lead to compromise of the data due to inter-laboratory variation.  Cultural fungi analyses are based solely on microscopic morphological identification of the spores or the colonies.  Differences in laboratory protocols and procedures could lead to potentially significant differences in the fungal species identification and quantification; therefore, standardization of methodology is essential.  This is not a request for competitive quotes, and no solicitation is available.  Any source who believes they can provide the required services (or product) is entitled to submit a Capability Statement to the point-of-contact identified in this announcement.  If any response(s) is received, a determination by the Contracting Officer not to compete this action is solely within the discretion of the Government.

This notice is issued for informational purposes only.  Any interested party may submit a capabilities statement to be received in the contracting office no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of this announcement.  Submit information to Rebecca Mullenax, MS-1019, Reference:  000HCCA7-2004-10867, DHHS/PHS/CDC/NIOSH/ALOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505.    The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any sources exist, therefore, no solicitation will be issued.  If no responses are received within 15 days, award will be made to Environmental Microbiology Lab, Inc.  Award will be made under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) without further notices being issued.  All responses received shall be considered by the Government.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE & REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  No solicitation is available. This RFI is released pursuant to FAR Part 15.201(e), Exchanges with Industry.  The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issues this Request for Information (RFI) regarding imaging systems for Large Scale Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) equipment. CBP is looking for new, innovative technical approaches to high-energy NII imaging systems.  The requirement is for four (4) configurations (fixed, mobile, rail and pallet).  These large scale NII imaging systems are for the detection of Weapons of Mass Destruction, (including nuclear weapons, dirty bombs, chemical and biological weapons, and their components), explosives, conventional weapons, drugs, and other contraband, concealed in steel-walled tankers, tractor trailers, towed vehicles, cargo containers, automobiles, pick-up trucks, buses, towed trailers, railcars and large pallets.
Critical system attributes being sought are as small as practicable physical size and weight, high reliability, high cargo and conveyance penetration, high quality imaging and low cost.
  These systems will be deployed at land border crossings and at seaports. The fixed and mobile inspection systems shall be capable of inspecting the largest commercial vehicles that are allowed on the public roadways. The pallet inspection system shall be capable of inspecting large pallets up to 5,000 lbs.  The rail inspection systems are required to image railcars within the North American Train Bridge Envelope (double stacked cars, tri-level auto carriers, boxcars, tankers, spine cars, grain cars and tankers). The trains will be traveling in both northbound and southbound directions at constant speeds. Imaging systems must perform with no gaps, no missing sections, and no loss of image data. Operationally, the systems need to completely penetrate fully laden cargo in a single scan and provide high throughput.  
The operational environment for all NII imaging systems ranges from desert to arctic conditions that typically include temperatures between –20 degrees to + 120 degrees F and winds of up to 40 mph (125 mph rail only). The rail, fixed and mobile systems shall be capable of operating outdoors during a 24-hour day, and in a variety of climatic environments such as the hot arid desert, warm and humid coastlines and extreme cold northern borders of the United States. The pallet system shall be capable of operating on a loading dock or in a warehouse. All inspection systems shall be capable of a minimum of 16 consecutive operating hours daily.  All systems shall be capable of being operated by a two-person team.
  As for radiation safety, list exclusion zone parameters for non-radiation workers at .05mR/hr above background. 
System resolution shall be 0.125 inches preferred but not less than 0.5 inch for mobile, fixed and pallet.  For rail only (one (1) inch resolution) at the systems maximum sustained throughput speed of 5-mph minimum up to 10-mph preferred (at track centerline). 
Penetration shall be sufficient to see through cargoes up to 8’ wide with densities up to 1g/cc.
Contrast sensitivity of at least 2% is desired throughout the penetration range and shall be quantified as it relates to speed (example: X % at Y mph or Y inch/sec). Image quality (resolution, contrast and penetration, etc.) shall be satisfied using high efficiency detectors and 16-bit minimum image processing technology.

To summarize, we are looking for new, innovative, high performance, NII technology approaches to image all containers, cargo and conveyances crossing U.S. borders in real time and (rail cars in near real time).
CBP requires for evaluation fully functional next generation production imaging inspection systems incorporating the latest technical advances. Of special interest is a built-in capability to passively detect (in a single pass) the presence of neutron and gamma radiation emissions.  Advanced “smart” signal processing to assist the operators in threat detection and identification is also of particular interest.
  The vendor shall provide a production schedule with the initial delivery within five months after Contract Award and deliveries of one each month thereafter.
 CBP will evaluate image resolution, contrast sensitivity and penetration by use of Image quality penetrameters in accordance with ASTM standards for radiographic imaging.  Radioactive materials and WMD detection and identification performance will be tested using standard radioactive test sources as described in table 3 of the ANSI Standard N42.35 as threat surrogates.
 The vendor will be required to show the entire target vehicle being scanned in a single screen display.  In addition the vendor will be required to provide examples of false color mapping of images using palettes.  The vendor will also have to demonstrate that the inspection systems meet all radiation safety NRC and state requirements and the appropriate NRC license for the production systems.
In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI, including any subsequent product demonstrations.  All responses are to be: provided on company letterhead, limited to 15 pages, and limited to commercially available off-the-shelf products (developmental products are not being considered).  Responses must demonstrate compliance with the system specifications listed above, include the applicable Federal Supply Schedule contract number and be submitted via e-mail, only, in Microsoft Office format to: terence.lew@dhs.gov with a copy to Dean.Titcomb@associates.dhs.gov.  Contacts must by email only.
 All packages submitted electronically or by electronic media shall be free of any computer virus. If a virus is found, the package will be destroyed and a replacement provided within 3 days after notification.  Response to this RFI must arrive in this office no later than 12:00 noon on July 22, 2004.

<SUBJECT>B -- Procurement of UC-781, an Experimental Topical Anti-HIV Microbicide, for use in a Phase I Clinical Trial
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is contemplating the award of a contract on an “Other than Full & Open Competition” basis to BioSyn, Inc. in accordance with FAR part 6.302-1(b).  The basis for this contemplation is that only one responsible source and no other supplies/services will satisfy agency requirements.  The requirement is as follows:  

This contract is intended to obtain a drug product which is available exclusively from one specific entity.  Biosyn, Inc. holds all right and patents for the development of UC-781 as a topical microbicide agent.  Placebo for the trials, while it does not contain UC-781, needs to be formulated and packaged to appear as identical as possible to active UC-781 in order to best permit blinding of the clinical trial, Also, product and placebo need to be labeled accurately and records of labeling kept by a single entity so as to permit unblinding following the conclusion of the trial.  It is therefore not feasible that placebo be provided by another entity.

UC-781 was selected for the clinical trials described in this document through an open, competitive process.  This process was initiated through an announcement soliciting collaboration from entities holding interest in potential anti-HIV topical Microbicides which appeared in the Federal Register in June, 2001.  Proposals were received for a total of five different agents which were tested by CDC laboratory scientists for in vitro toxicity and anti-HIV activity.  UC-781 was selected for clinical trial based upon its favorable performance in these in vitro studies.  

The anticipated performance period will not exceed two years from the date of contract award.  It is believed that BioSyn, Inc. possesses the capability and is uniquely qualified to perform this requirement as stated above.  All responsible sources that feel they should be considered qualified to provide the foregoing products/services may submit a response by no later than 2:00pm EST, on July 22, 2004 by e-mail to Lisa Lombard at LPL0@CDC.GOV (that is LPL ZERO).  See Note 22.

<SUBJECT>R -- Summer Bash Sponsorship Opportunity at Robins AFB
<DESC>On Saturday, August 7, 2004 the 78th Services Division is hosting our 13th Annual Summer Bash event at Robins Park from 4 to 9 p.m.  Summer Bash is a day of family fun with carnival games and rides, live musical entertainment, great food, clowns, prizes, a firework show and more. It’s our way of thanking the base populace for their patronage throughout the year. Anyone with a base ID may join in on the fun. Average attendance is 6,000 people. 

Sponsor booths for 2004 include a 10’ X 10’ canopy, tables, and chairs as well as name/logo recognition on all Summer Bash publicity, such as posters, base-wide email, Robins Rev-up where permissible (20,000 per week), the Edge magazine (15,000 per month), etc.  If a larger canopy area is needed we can accommodate.  The sooner we confirm sponsorship, the more name and/or logo recognition you receive.  

If you cannot participate as a sponsor we would love to have you participate as a donor.  Past donors have made donations such as free museum or park passes, free nights stays at a hotel, gift certificates, T-shirts, etc.  We would love to have the opportunity to give away a car to one of our Summer Bash attendees as well.  Anything your company could provide us we would be very grateful for and will use your donations as prizes to give away at the event itself.  Those companies interested in being a sponsor or donor for Summer Bash 2004 should contact Marisa Barber no later than July 19, 2004 at 478-926-6629 or 478-926-5492.

BACKGROUND:  The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is responsible for the care and custody of inmates located in more than 100 of its facilities.  The Health Services Division (HDS) of the BOP is responsible for assuring the provisions of health care services are consistent with community standards.  These services are provided by Health Service Units (HSU) at the Federal Penitentiaries, Correctional Institutions, Camps, Detention Centers, Correctional Centers and Medical Referral Centers.  Primary Care is provided at the Medical Referral Centers or community hospitals, while tertiary care is provided at community hospitals.
The current average daily federal inmate population in the BOP is approximately 147,000.  During fiscal year 2003 (FY 03), 346 inmate deaths occurred (death rate of approximately 240 per 100,000).  At this current rate, during FY 04, the BOP will experience approximately 271 inmate deaths.  As the inmate population increases over the next five Fiscal Years, approximately 271 or more inmate deaths will occur per Fiscal Year for a total of approximately 1355 deaths over the five-year period.
SCOPE OF WORK:  An external mortality review is required to objectively evaluate individual medical records of federal inmates who have died while under the medical care of the BOP.  The purpose of this review is to focus on the quality appropriateness of medical care which was provided to each individual inmate prior to his/her death.  This review will provide a method of monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of health services being provided and support the quality of care being delivered to inmates as compared to community health standards.
A single reviewer is required to conduct all scheduled review sessions for each performance period.  Approximately six (6) review sessions will be conducted per performance period.  Each review session should last for at least one day (i.e., 8 hours), but not more than two consecutive days.  Normally, each review session should consist of an evaluation of approximately 35 to 50 inmate medical records.
Each review session shall involve an extensive evaluation of each inmate’s medical record, including, but not limited to, the BOP’s Multilevel Mortality Review Reports.

AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES:  The Contractor shall be available for at least six (6) review sessions during each period of performance.

EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES:  The BOP shall provide the necessary facility in order for the Contractor to conduct each review session and present his/her findings to the Medical Director or designee.  The Contractor is responsible for general office supplies necessary to conduct each review session.

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
"Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

“Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is attached.
Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refiling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
