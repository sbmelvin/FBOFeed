<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces its intention to negotiate a cost reimbursement type contract to conduct testing for National HIV Incidence Surveillance and other CDC HIV surveillance activities using the BED assay and remnant samples (serum, plasma, dried fluid spots) from newly diagnosed individuals from sites funded for HIV incidence surveillance and report the results to these sites.  The Serologic Testing Algorithm for Recent HIV Seroconversion (STARHS) is the currently accepted method used for the estimation of HIV incidence.  With STARHS, confirmed HIV-positive samples are analyzed using the Calypte HIV-1 BED Incidence EIA (BED assay).  The BED assay is a quantitative assay that indirectly measures the proportion of HIV-1 specific IgG antibodies with respect to total IgG.  Samples from recently infected patients have a lower proportion of HIV-1 specific IgG antibodies than samples from patients with long term infection and therefore can be classified as recently infected using this assay.   Quantitative values from this assay are evaluated against control values and cut-off points to estimate the likelihood that the sample being tested is from a newly infected individual or someone with a long term infection.  Results from the BED assay are used with clinical, demographic, and testing history information to estimate the incidence of a population.  

The major tasks to be completed under this contract include, 1) National Incidence Surveillance Testing/BED Assay, 2) Shipping Requirements, 3) Data Management and 4) STARHS Lab Briefings.  The CDC anticipates a period of performance from, January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008, with four additional option years.  The estimated volume of tests per year is 150,000.

This is not a Request for Proposal.  The intention of this notice is to notify potential offerors that Solicitation No. 2008-N-09691 will be available for download on the Federal Business Opportunities website at www.fedbizopps.gov on or before November 13, 2007.  This will be a full and open competition.  Additionally, all amendments and responses to questions will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website.  The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, either before or after the closing date.  All questions must be submitted in writing to Dyad Searcy at dsearcy@cdc.gov or Betty Vannoy at bbv9@cdc.gov.  All responsible sources must be registered in the Central Contracting Registration (CCR) website at www.ccr.gov.  No telephone calls will be accepted.  It is the sole responsibility of the offeror to continually view the website for any amendments made to this notice.

<CONTACT>Vernon Hadley Contracting Officer 5037364469     Vernon_Hadley@fws.gov;
<DESC>Description The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service's Desert National Wildlife Refuge includes more than 1.5 million acres of diverse Mojave Desert, including one of the largest intact blocks of desert bighorn sheep habitat remaining in the Southwest.  The administrative office for the refuge is currently located at the Corn Creek Field Station, approximately 25 miles north of Las Vegas.   Las Vegas draws 35-37 million national and international tourists each year, with a growing percentage of those visitors seeking non-gaming recreational activities.  The Service intends to draw a small portion of these visitors to a visitor and administrative facility at the Corn Creek Field Station in an effort to raise public awareness for the National Wildlife Refuge System's mission and to provide information on wildlife and habitats of the Desert NWR.  Several existing buildings will be removed as part of this project. The Service has developed a national Suite of Standard Facility Design Concepts.  This project will utilize the medium-size, one story floor plan.  As these standard designs are only developed to the concept level, we have an opportunity to include many sustainable and energy efficient features within the confines of the standard design concept with the goal of LEED Platinum Certification.  We are considering straw bale and/or rammed earth for a highly insulated building, passive solar, geothermal and photo voltaic to provide energy needs, composting toilets, rainwater harvesting, and pervious concrete.  These were proposed during an earlier planning document, Desert Visitor Center and Administrative Facilities at Corn Creek, Las Vegas, NV. Concurrent to this project, a habitat restoration and trail project is being designed and constructed.  Some consideration for construction sequencing will be needed to insure both projects can be completed to provide a seamless site.  A separate interpretive contractor for the visitor center will also run concurrently that the A/E firm will need to coordinate with. The overall design and construction project will have a contract completion period of approximately two-years. This project includes, but is not limited to: 1.	A value engineering analysis of the concept outlined in Desert Visitor Center and Administrative Facilities at Corn Creek, Las Vegas, NV. 2.	Design of an 11,000 sf (approx.) Administration/Visitor facility that includes office space for Desert NWR staff, visitor facilities, lobby, exhibit hall, reception area, bookstore, multi-purpose room, archaeological curation room with sliding storage shelving, public restrooms, and covered picnic shelter. 3.	Design of a 4,000 sf (approx.) maintenance building.  This building will include 5 bays, 2 offices, locker room, shower, restroom, laundry/utility room, and new septic system for the building.							 4.	Refinement of the Site Plan for the Corn Creek Field Station that includes a new administration/visitor building, maintenance building, and associated vehicular and pedestrian circulation.  The plan will also need to show the restoration area and trail, but the architect-engineering firm will not be responsible for its design. 5.	Design of utilities for the project.  Utilities exist on site (power, phone, well, septic) and the Site Plan should show all existing and proposed infrastructure, and as well as structures proposed for demolition. 6.	Engineering feasibility to determine utility upgrades needed to handle increased loads of the new facilities, including sustainable features proposed in the earlier planning effort.  Long-term operation and maintenance must be taken into consideration. 7.	Design and documentation for LEED certification. 8.	Coordination with interpretive contractor to incorporate interpretive requirements into the project, such as electric power, lighting, acoustical, and space provisions for exhibits. 9.	Detailed cost estimate of the approved alternative assuming the midpoint of construction in January 2009. 10.	Options to use the approved design (or a modified version) for additional, USFWS projects. SCOPE OF WORK The scope of professional services will require at a minimum for use by USFWS Contracting Officers: professional architectural, engineering, interior design, and related consulting services for verification of existing systems and conditions, concept design documents, design development documents, construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), document preparation , as well as possible post-construction contract services (PCCS) that may include shop drawing review and approval, construction inspection, and other required supplemental services if so requested by the Government. For the Corn Creek Field Station, the scope of design work would include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following: (1) survey of existing conditions; (2) detailed scope verification; (3) energy conservation analysis; (4) complete architectural and engineering design; (5) preparation of specifications and CADD drawings for construction documents; (6) value engineering; (7) costs analysis; (8) post-construction contract services (PCCS); (8) record drawings and construction phase A/E inspection services. Throughout the design process, the selected lead designer and A/E will assist the Government in identifying those elements of work that can be accomplished within the cost limitations for the project.  The scope of Construction work to be covered in the design,  as it relates to this initial project will include, but not be limited to, the following:  value engineering; costs analysis; assistance with construction proposal analysis, post-construction contract services (PCCS), record drawings and construction phase A/E inspection services. SELECTION PROCESS This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms with a lead designer/engineer interested in contracting for this work. The A/E Firm as used in this RFQ means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity permitted by law to practice the profession of architecture or engineering that will have contractual responsibility for the project design. The lead designer/engineer is the individual or the team of designers and engineers who will have primary responsibility to develop the concept and the project design. The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows: In Stage I, interested lead designer/engineers and associated A/E firms will submit portfolios of accomplishments that establish the design capabilities of the lead designer/engineer-design firm.  In STAGE II, short-listed lead designer/engineer-A/E firms and representatives from their team will be interviewed. STAGE I All documentation will be in an 8 x 11 format. The assembled Stage I portfolio should be no more than 1-inch thick. Submissions may be double-sided where feasible.  The portfolio should include the following: a cover letter referencing the FedBizOpps announcement and briefly describing the firm and its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy LEED certified accomplishments; Standard Form 330 Architect Engineer Qualifications Part II dated no earlier than 12 months from the date of this synopsis; and responses to the submission requirements and evaluation criteria listed below. The SF 330 may be obtained from http://www.gsa.gov.forms.far.htm.  SF254 and SF255 Forms will not be accepted.  An A/E Evaluation Board consisting of a private sector peer and USFWS professionals will evaluate the submissions. The board will establish a shortlist of three to six firms. The shortlist will be based on the A/E Design Firm's submittal in response to this Request for Qualifications. The A/E Design Firm will provide specific evidence of its capabilities to deliver Design Excellence within the context of sustainable energy design, and ability to design within cost limitations, and will express its design approach and philosophy. Identification of team members, other than the lead designer(s) is not required at this stage. Consultant and production firm (if different from the design firm) information should not be included in the Stage I portfolio. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS AND EVALUATION: Qualifications submitted by each A/E firm will be reviewed and evaluated based on the following criteria: (1) PAST PERFORMANCE ON DESIGN (35%):   The A/E Design Firm will submit a portfolio of not more than five projects completed in the last ten years (maximum of five pages per project).     The narrative shall address the design approach with salient features for each project and discuss how the clients program, function, image, mission, economic, schedule, and operational objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution.  It should comment on the relevance of submitted projects to the USFWS (sustainable energy in a desert environment) project including how the project clearly demonstrates competence in sustainable, energy efficient features, and whether eligible for LEED certification.  This section of the submission should include tangible evidence such as certificates, awards, and peer recognition, etc., demonstrating design excellence, and provide a client reference contact for each project, including name, title, address, email, phone, and fax numbers.     A representative floor plan, site plan, building section, or other appropriate drawing, and a minimum of two photographs must be included for each project. (2) PHILOSOPHY AND DESIGN INTENT (25%): In the lead designer/engineer's words (maximum of two written pages), as it relates to this project, state: the parameters of an overall design philosophy; his/her approach to the challenges of sustainable energy design and related issues; and the parameters that may apply to design and building in the USA Southwest Desert, with a focus on coordinating construction, and working with other contractors (i.e., interpretive services and trail restoration and design. (3) LEAD DESIGNER/ENGINEER PROFILE (15%): Submit a biographical sketch (maximum of three pages) including education, professional experience, recognition for design efforts inclusive of portfolio examples. Identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to each project. (4) LEAD DESIGNER/ENGINEER'S PORTFOLIO (25%):   Submit a portfolio representative of the lead designer/engineer's ability to provide Design Excellence.     Address his or her participation in each project.   If a single designer/engineer, submit a portfolio of up to three projects completed in the last ten years (maximum of five pages per project).  If the lead designer/engineer is a team, submit graphics and a description of up to two projects from each lead designer/engineer or lead design/engineer discipline.  The narrative shall address the design philosophy with salient features for each project and discuss how the client's program, functional, image, mission, economic, schedule, and operations and maintenance objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution. Include tangible evidence such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc., demonstrating design excellence. Where there is duplication with criteria (1) Past Performance on Design, the lead Designer/engineer shall address his or her participation in the project.  One of the goals of this project is to develop an award winning design that meets the project's programming and budget parameters.  In addition, appropriate and cost-effective integration of sustainable design principles will be required. Formal LEED certification as outlined by U.S. Green Building will be pursued dependent upon project budget. Nonetheless, LEED 2.0 criteria will still be used as one of the tools in developing a successful design solution for this project. Therefore, in addition to aesthetic design excellence, the demonstration of successful integration of sustainable practices will also be evaluated. STAGE II: The short listed lead designers/engineers and associated A/E firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants.   Sufficient time will be provided for the A/E Design Firm/lead designer/engineer to establish its team. The firms will be required to complete Standard Form 330 Architect-Engineer Qualifications Parts I and II that reflect the entire design team, including consultant information. The government will establish the detailed evaluation criteria and the date that these submittals are due and provide the selection criteria for the interviews along with the Stage I shortlist announcement. The board will interview each team. Candidates should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the criteria indicated above and evaluation criteria as established for Stage II, and demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements. Emphasis will be placed on the lead designer/engineer-A/E team's understanding of the unique aspects of the project, their design philosophy, project management process, and quality assurance plan.  Responses to the evaluation criteria and interview questions will be used to rank the A/E Teams. IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR STAGE I SUBMITTALS Firms having the capabilities to perform the services described in this announcement are invited to respond by submitting (1) Standard Form 330 Architect Engineer Qualifications Part II, which must not be dated more than twelve (12) months before the date of this synopsis along with (2) letter of interest and (3) the portfolio To:   "	Contracting Officer:	Vernon Hadley,  "	Delivery Address:	USFWS/CGS, 911 NE 11th Ave, Portland, Oregon 97232-4181 ALL SUBMISSIONS ARE DUE BY 4:00 PM PST, February 5, 2008.

Formal LEED certification as outlined by U.S. Green Building will be pursued dependent upon project budget. Nonetheless, LEED 2.0 criteria will still be used as one of the tools in developing a successful design solution for this project. Therefore, in addition to aesthetic design excellence, the demonstration of successful integration of sustainable practices will also be evaluated. STAGE II: The short listed lead designers/engineers and associated A/E firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants.   Sufficient time will be provided for the A/E Design Firm/lead designer/engineer to establish its team. The firms will be required to complete Standard Form 330 Architect-Engineer Qualifications Parts I and II that reflect the entire design team, including consultant information. The government will establish the detailed evaluation criteria and the date that these submittals are due and provide the selection criteria for the interviews along with the Stage I shortlist announcement. The board will interview each team. Candidates should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the criteria indicated above and evaluation criteria as established for Stage II, and demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements. Emphasis will be placed on the lead designer/engineer-A/E team's understanding of the unique aspects of the project, their design philosophy, project management process, and quality assurance plan.  Responses to the evaluation criteria and interview questions will be used to rank the A/E Teams. IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR STAGE I SUBMITTALS Firms having the capabilities to perform the services described in this announcement are invited to respond by submitting (1) Standard Form 330 Architect Engineer Qualifications Part II, which must not be dated more than twelve (12) months before the date of this synopsis along with (2) letter of interest and (3) the portfolio To:   "	Contracting Officer:	Vernon Hadley,  "	Delivery Address:	USFWS/CGS, 911 NE 11th Ave, Portland, Oregon 97232-4181 ALL SUBMISSIONS ARE DUE BY 4:00 PM PST, February 5, 2008.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is soliciting proposals on a full and open competition basis to perform the maintenance and fielding of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) Support - Medical Provider Component (MPC) which will include collecting, abstracting, and cleaning data collected from the medical providers. For all medical provider types, the Contractor will also be responsible for statistical matching of data from the MEPS-MPC to the MEPS-Household Component (HC) and producing matched data files, including documentation and codebooks. In addition for prescribed medicines, the Contractor will be responsible for statistical and analytical editing and imputation of the data.  (NOTE: the MEPS Household Component requirement is a separate contract to be awarded.)  The contract will be performance based for an initial period of performance of three and one-half years with three three-year option, under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541720.  

The primary objective of the MPC is to collect data from medical providers (hospitals, physicians, home health care agencies, pharmacies, long term health care facilities) on expenditures for medical services provided to MEPS sample persons.  MPC data serve as an imputation source for item nonresponse to reduce the level of bias in survey estimates of medical expenditures.  It also serves as source of expenditure information on physician charges that are associated with hospital care but not billed by the hospital as well as serving the primary source of expenditure information for Medicaid recipients and prescribed medicines.  Offerors must meet requirements of the Pro-Children Act of 1994, Buy American Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Privacy Act, Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), federal policy for the protection of human research subjects (45CFR46) which will include an Institutional Review Board (IRB) review, and the Paperwork Reduction Act. 

Tasks will revolve around the MEPS-MPC which collects data from all hospitals, emergency rooms, home health care agencies, outpatient departments, long term health care facilities and pharmacies reported by MEPS Household Component (HC) respondents as well as all physicians who provide services for patients in hospitals but bill separately from the hospital. Office-based medical providers where the provider is either a doctor of medicine (MD) or Osteopathy (DO) or practices under the direct supervision of an MD or DO are included in the MPC as well.  Long term health care facilities include nursing homes, assisted living facilities, rehabilitation facilities, as well as any health care facility providing medical care to those reporting such care in the HC of the MEPS.


Offerors must possess comprehensive expertise in data collection, abstraction and coding of medical and billing data from various types of health care providers, as well as extensive statistical expertise and extensive experience in data file development and documentation.  In order to evaluate the Offeror?s expertise in the aforementioned areas and on the processes to perform such tasks, the following must be included in the proposal: a) implement and document a sample; b) unduplication within a sample; c) identification of hospital physicians; d) maintenance of survey questionnaires and materials; e) recruit, manage and train data collection staff, abstraction staff, and coding staff; f) data collection from hospitals, hospital identified physicians, office based sample (includes HMOs), agency home health care providers, pharmacies, and long term health care facilities; g) data processing; h) development of security plan; i) forms control and receipt; j) data entry; k) coding and cleaning of data; l) matching data; m) editing and imputation of prescribed medicines data; n) preparation and delivery of internal MPC Files including archival versions of the full operational database and the following medical event files: hospital stays (includes hospital identified physician and their payments and can be identified as such), emergency room visits, outpatient department visits, medical provider visits (includes HMOs), home health care visits, long term care stays (includes assisted living facilities, nursing homes, rehabilitation facilities, etc.), and prescribed medicines.  Offeror must also provide an overall plan for coordinating deliverables including data files and materials between the HC and MPC contractors, particularly those occurring concurrently or in a linked manner; integration of data collection methods and processing, as well as data cleaning, data abstraction and matching tasks; the statistical and substantive soundness of the data matching and data editing and imputation (for prescribed drugs only) techniques proposed; quality control; and a plan for addressing innovation and technological advancements and capability to maintain compatibility with industry mechanisms.    

The MEPS-MPC is to be comprised of core staff of seasoned professionals with education and experience in areas such as data collection from medical care providers of charge and payment,  condition, and medical procedures and services data, and; abstraction of medical and billing records; coding of health care data; statistical matching of records; statistical and analytical editing and imputation of prescribed medicines data; health care facilities billing systems and operations; training; and constructing large databases.  A PMI-certified Project Manager is required as well as demonstrated ability to provide EVM information. In the event that the MEPS-MPC core staff does not include particular expertise needed to accomplish a particular task, the MEPS-MPC is to obtain such expertise through consultants and/or subcontracts. Subcontracting to meet the DHHS? socio-economic goals must be included in the offeror?s proposal. Potential offerors are encouraged to visit the MEPS website at www.meps.ahrq.gov . Specific files and reports to assist understanding of the requirement will be available for release (thumb drive) , after the solicitation is issued.  Instructions will be in the solicitation. 

In addition to the solicitation being available on this site, it will be available for downloading from the internet on AHRQ?s site at http://ahrq.gov . Once in AHRQ?s homepage go to "Funding Opportunities," then to "Contracts", and then to "Request for Proposal (RFP)".

It is estimated that the solicitation will be issued on/about January 18, 2008 with proposals due March 13, 2008.

<DESC>The purpose of this requirement is to establish a performance based repair contract for F-16 Canopy Repair.  The intended contract will incorporate a two year basic period with three one year options.  This contract is restricted to Lockheed Pinellas. Performance of this requirement requires that the contractor be Lockheed certified (possess a Lockheed Martin license) and have in its possession the necessary tooling to perform this repair.  There are two sets of tooling in existence to build and repair F-16 canopies, of which one is owned by Lockheed Pinellas and the other is owned by the government.  The government owned tooling is not currently in serviceable condition.  The government intends to hold an industry day during 2008 to invite interested companies the opportunity to evaluate the tooling for refurbishment. If there is interest in refurbishment, the government will consider a new contract effort in lieu of exercising a contract option under this present effort.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC proposes to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP), on a sole source basis to Jeffries Technology Solutions. This requirement encompasses specialized systems engineering and analysis services in support of the Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) System Concepts, Integration and Planning (SCIP) Office. The prospective procurement will be an Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Cost No Fee (CNF) Contract with a 3-year basic period of performance.  The Contractor shall, through the manipulation of " Communication Engineering, Operations Engineering, and Systems Engineering" perform analysis, conduct system engineering studies, and develop requirements with the emphasis on supporting the goal of the NASA Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) System Concepts, Integration and Planning (SCIP) Office to develop the end-to-end, interoperable communications and navigation (C&N) infrastructure that provides the Constellation Program elements the connectivity required to execute the Vision for Space Exploration.  In addition, significant modifications and enhancements involving the use of new and sophisticated communications methodologies and technologies that have seldom or never been utilized in the C&N networks must be made to NASA?s existing C&N infrastructure.  In particular, there must be enhancements to the communications protocols that will be required to meet the needs of the new flight vehicles being developed under the Constellation Program and be able to bypass as much of the Consultative Committee on Space Data Standards (CCSDS) as possible. Jeffries is the only known company possessing the necessary knowledge, expertise, and experience required by SCIP.  Jeffries experience dates back to the 1980?s in this area, including the initial development of the Advanced Orbiting Systems (AOS) which began the standardization of spacecraft communications. They defined the transition steps to utilize  CCSDS-compliant data packets, instead of the typical IP Packets (Internet Protocol Packets) used in Earth systems and have continued to define and develop the various changes required to space communications protocols over the past two decades, such that space-related communications systems continue to work with the constantly evolving commercial communication protocols.  It would require years for an unfamiliar contractor to acquire the level of knowledge to become able to perform the highly-specialized nature of the work to be done, causing major delays in meeting the Constellation's missions.   Statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)--Only One Responsible Source. However, organizations who believe they can provide these services without any detrimental impact to the program schedules supported by this work, should fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See the following Notes NASA Specific Note B, and Notes 22 and 26.  Interested organizations have 45 days from the publication of this synopsis to submit in writing to the identified point of contact, their qualifications/capabilities. Such qualifications/capabilities will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. Responses received after the 45 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis and will not be considered. A determination by the Government to not compete this proposed effort on a full and competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All qualified responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by this agency. Any reference notes can be viewed at the following URL: http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasanote.html        Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for the design, development, testing, and evaluation of a versatile cryogenic freezing, storage, and transport unit for a broad range of science samples on board the Space Shuttle and the ISS.  NASA JSC also requires analysis of the GLACIER units compatibility with other space flight vehicles. NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from the University of Alabama in Birmingham, Alabama. The GLACIER system is a highly complex system that utilizes cutting edge technology and has many unique manufacturing and assembly processes.  As the designer and original manufacturer of the GLACIER system, UAB inherently possesses the required in-depth knowledge of the many highly specialized innovations the system employs.  Knowledge and understanding of these innovations is required in order to complete the requirements.  In addition, the existing manufacturing drawings will not be delivered until the first unit is delivered.  Until that time, the drawings will not be converted into a standard NASA format and other contractors would not easily be able to build off the drawings.  Furthermore, components of GLACIER require special tooling and facilities that UAB has already procured, which a new contractor would have to develop under new contracts.  The technical risk associated with re-inventing already established and advanced processes would result in a high likelihood of failure.  The increased cost and schedule impact to the program would be unacceptable, and as such, the future of Cold Stowage for ISS would be in jeopardy.	 The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 1:00 p.m. local time on January 18, 2008.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 1 June 2010, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

This BAA is focused on technologies for dealing with security on modern high speed digital networks and enterprise systems.  A modern enterprise system is faced with numerous threats, both internal and external.  The current ability to protect against the full spectrum of threats poses a severe economic and performance burden on the enterprise and national infrastructure.  This BAA addresses factors related to our ability to understand and decompose these threats; we are interested in both new paradigms and existing concepts applied in new and novel fashion.

This BAA will consider issues related to software vulnerabilities.  Other types of vulnerabilities are not excluded, but since most problems relate to software design and coding, these areas will receive the majority of resources.

As Web 2.0 and enterprise class applications continue to proliferate, it is becoming increasingly difficult to guarantee security of systems, users, or data.  Large applications and copious open source products make it arduous for information assurance specialists to review and certify software as free of potential security flaws.  This BAA is looking for new ways to find, isolate, and manage software security flaws and weakness.  To participate, it is expected that the performer(s) will have an expert level of understanding of current tools, techniques, and technologies for vulnerability detection and analysis.  In addition to knowledge, hands-on practical experience is required.  Graduated awards will be offered to performers demonstrating requisite experience.  This effort is not theoretical in nature.  Performers are expected to propose tools and techniques, develop, and then demonstrate them in a Government controlled test-bed environment.  

Additional details and requirements are classified.  Please contact the Technical POC listed in section VII for further information.

II. AWARD  INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $22.1M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 08 - $5.4M; FY 09 - $7.5M; and FY 10 - $9.2M.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 12 months with dollar amounts normally ranging between $100,000 to $700,000 per year.  There is also the potential to make awards up to any dollar value.  Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements depending upon the nature of the work proposed.

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Technical Merit -- Including the novelty, potential and approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   

The Government may use the services of Scitor Corporation personnel in an advisory role for the technical evaluation of white papers/proposals. The exclusive responsibility for evaluation remains with the Government. Representatives of the foregoing firm(s) participating in the evaluation process will sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to highlight the sensitivity of the evaluation process and to protect any proprietary information within the proposals. Any objection to the use of any or all the personnel identified above must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a Secret or Top Secret/SCI facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to Secret or Top Secret/SCI information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.

<DESC>The AERO-51B munitions trailer is currently undergoing a conversion-in-lieu-of-procurement (CILOP) via contract N68335-06-C-0383.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst NJ intends to enter into negotiations with DeVal Incorporated of Philadelphia, PA (DeVal) to modify contract N68335-06-C-0383 to replace the main wiring harness P/N 67A314D20.  

This modification will direct the contractor to remove the main wiring harness P/N 67A314D20 and replace it with a new wiring harness because the orientation of the existing wiring harness --- the wires and connections to the plug pins --- are flawed.  If used, the existing wiring harness will cause improper functioning of tail light operations (stop, turn, running).  Neither these flaws nor the correction of such were contemplated until the trailer assets were received from the fleet and inspected by Government personnel.  

Negotiations will be conducted on a sole source basis with DeVal because DeVal is already under contract to disassemble the trailers, perform the CILOP, and reassemble the trailers in accordance with N68335-06-C-0383.  The new wiring harness will be designed to compliment the new LED lighting system and will be installed, as part of the CILOP, when the trailers are reassembled.  

The Government intends to solicit and negotiate this requirement under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any and all responses must be received within 15 days of this synopsis notice.  A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based on the responses received to this synopsis is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Integration Contract.  Procurement for Integration Contractor shall be set aside for competition among 8(a) vendors.  Minimum Guaranteed Funding Amount: The contractor shall receive a minimum of $25,000 over the life of the contract.  Maximum Contrac t Amount: The total maximum contract amount is $33 million in task orders over the life of the contract.<BR><BR>STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES (INTERGRATION)<BR>C-1	GENERAL<BR>C-1.1	Background<BR>The National Guard Bureaus Army Strength Maintenance Divisions (N GB-ASM) mission is to provide policies, programs, procedures, and guidance to the states and territories to meet their end-strength objectives in accordance with the Strength Maintenance Philosophy. Specifically, to recruit quality soldiers, conduct attrit ion management designed to reduce first-term soldier losses and training pipeline losses, and ensure retention and extension of quality soldiers before the expiration of their term-of-service.<BR>The Strength Maintenance Philosophy builds a partnership for  strength readiness between unit leaders and the recruiting and retention force. Working together, they can develop programs and incentives to meet each units strength objectives. There are three strength maintenance tenets:<BR>?	RecruitingRecruiting Qua lity (Non-Prior and Prior Service) Soldiers,<BR>?	RetentionRetaining Soldiers who reach their Expiration Term of Service (ETS, and<BR>?	Attrition ManagementReducing Losses While Still Under Contractual Military Obligation.<BR>As part of these activities,  the Army National Guard also has a related objective, which is to capture and improve access to performance data and program data.<BR>The interaction of the NGB Army Strength Maintenance processes of Recruiting, Retention, and Attrition Management are sho wn in the following diagram. This diagram indicates the flow of combat-ready soldiers within the National Guard. It indicates how the processes of recruiting, retention, and attrition affect the end-strength objective. The Army National Guard has multiple related yearly objectives that it uses to while managing these processes to achieve the congressionally mandated end-strength objective.<BR>To support these three tenets, the NGB-ASM requires contractor support services to continue, improve, and expand cur rent efforts and to create and develop innovative Recruitment and Retention programs. These must be achieved while demonstrating improved outcomes consistent with the National Guards three tenets of Recruitment, Retention, and Managing Attrition and respo nding to ARNGs foremost goal:  to attain and maintain congressionally authorized end-strength.<BR><BR>C-1.2	Purpose <BR>The Recruiting and Retention contract period of performance expires in February of 2007. However, various task orders from that contrac t have periods of performance that stretch out in to the middle of calendar 2007. In addition, other separate contracts that NGB-ASM intends to absorb into the new Recruitment and Retention contract have periods of performance that also spread across 2007.  <BR>NGB-ASM has determined that using two types of contractsone a single award contract with an integration contractor and one a multiple award IDIQ contract with five contractorsare the most effective way to achieve NGB-ASM goals. The integration contr actor will institute a permanent organization staffed with full time subject matter experts, specialists, and managers. The IDIQ services contractors will develop and implement a comprehensive set of programs that helps ASM meet their objectives. Each cont ractor will be able to team with outside subcontractors and vendors to round out the full complement of skills required by this solicitation.<BR>Consistent with performance-based contracting practices, NGB-ASM will define the work in terms of objectives ra ther than specific tasks. As a result, it is then becomes the Offerors responsibility to propose how the stated objectives would be achieved and to define the metrics to measure performance. Offerors may propose for the integration contractor role or the IDIQ services contractor role, but not both.<BR>C-2.

_______________________________________________________________


The Federal Acquisition Service of the General Services Administration (GSA) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to implement a Local Services Acquisition (LSA) for Telecommunications Services.  The Government will award a series of Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts, with a base period of three years and four (4) twelve month option periods.  Firm Fixed Price task orders will be issued under the resultant IDIQ contract.  The Government plans to award multiple LSA contracts in the states of Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Delaware.  These contracts will be for the use of all Federal agencies, authorized Federal contractors, agency-sponsored universities and laboratories and, as authorized by law or regulation, state, local, and tribal Governments, and other organizations.  The Government has defined three service groups: Voice Services (VS), Data Transmission Services (DTS) and Internet Access Services (IAS), along with the labor and material necessary to connect these services to customer premises equipment (CPE).  Offerors must propose mandatory voice services to be eligible for an award.

The Government desires to make multiple awards for LSA services but reserves the right to limit the number of awards.  Contracts will be awarded to Offerors whose proposals are most advantageous to the Government.  The actual number of contracts awarded will be determined by the Government and based on technical acceptability and price evaluation of mandatory LSA services.  The following Technical factors will be considered: Technical Approach, Past Performance, and Management Approach.  The Technical Factors of Technical Approach and Past Performance will be approximately equal in weight and each will be greater in weight than the Management Approach factor.  The combined weight of all technical evaluation factors will be approximately equal to the Price Factor of Total Evaluated Discounted Cost.  Competitive formal source selection procedures will be used as set forth in FAR Part 15.  Offerors are advised that an award may be made without discussion or any contact concerning the proposals received.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; and to award contracts to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total evaluated discounted cost.  Therefore, proposals should be initially submitted on the most favorable terms.

The Request for Proposal (RFP), consisting of the solicitation and all attachments will be issued and posted electronically on the www.fedbizoppps.gov website.  Any questions regarding this synopsis should be directed to Kristin L. Markiewicz, GSA Contract Specialist, at Kristin.Markiewicz@gsa.gov.  This procurement is being conducted under full and open competition on an unrestricted basis under NAICS Code 517110.  The solicitation should be available on or about 07/23/2007.  Potential offerors should be advised that the date of a pre-proposal conference will be announced at the same time as the issuance of the RFP and is estimated to be conducted approximately two weeks after the official RFP is posted.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to RFQ-TX-08-00023 is to provide answers to questions.

1.  What is to become of the material and equipment that is to be removed from each of these sites? 

Answer:  Needs to be disposed of as part of the contract.
 
2.  For the sites that still have electrical service, will EPA or LDEQ coordinate the power removal or will we need to do that?  Usually it is that party paying the bills that needs to instigate the power removal. 

Answer:  The electric company has been notified and we are not using power but the contractor will need to do the disconnect.  Only 3 of the sites have to have a disconnect and only one of these 3 has active power.  The other 2 never had power.
 
3.  Will all of the fence poles, support posts, and utility poles need to be removed out of the ground or will it be acceptable to cut them off at or below ground level?  

Answer: All poles and posts and cement slabs need to be removed.  We have to leave the sites they way they were before installed anything.  However, all poles were temporary poles so there are no major utility poles to deal with. 
 
4.  Will we have full unrestricted access to all of these sites including weekends and evenings? 

Answer:  Yes
 
5.  Is there a time table for removing this equipment?  If so, is there a deadline? 

Answer:  All work must be completed by May 31, 2008.

6.  Regarding the disposal of the material and equipment, I am interpreting the statement "needs to be disposed of as part of the contract" as meaning that EPA nor any other party will claim ownership or rights to this material, however we chose to dispose of it.  Please let me know if that is not correct.

Answer: That is correct-there is one location that LDEQ may want to leave in place but other than that-all the material just need to be dismantled and thrown away. All equipment has already been removed.

<DESC>The Small Business Administration (SBA) is providing notification, consistent with Guiding Principle 2.b.ii.A of the May 2006 Competition Framework for Financial Management Lines of Business Migrations, of its intent to conduct a public-private competition for financial management shared services that includes modernization, hosting, administration and application management of SBA?s Loan Management and Accounting System (LMAS).  Private sector participation will be sought using the Federal Supply Schedules in accordance with the procedures of FAR Subpart 8.4. Public sector participation will be obtained from Public Sector Shared Services Providers (SSP).  

SBA is using the ?7-Steps to Performance Based Acquisition Methodology? for identifying the LMAS solution and the solution-provider. Prior to developing this solicitation, SBA conducted extensive market research as part of Step-2 of the 7-Steps process.  The purpose of this research was to (1) educate SBA on industry capabilities, best practices, and experiences of other organizations on similar endeavors as well as acquisition approaches utilized and (2) develop the solicitation and an acquisition strategy (Step-3 of the 7-Steps process).   The research included a large number of participants from a wide sector of industry as well as Federal and commercial shared services providers.  A pre-solicitation notice was also published on FedBizOpps in early September, 2007.

Based on all the responses to the pre-solicitation notice, SBA determined that an acquisition strategy based on GSA Schedule-70 is best suited to support its needs.  Please be advised that SBA will soon be requesting proposals from (1) a select group of companies who were deemed to be viable competitors and possess a GSA Schedule ? 70 and (2) a select group of public Shared Services Providers (SSPs) who can provide the required services using Inter-Agency Agreements, collectively the ?Competitive Pool? (Step-4 of the 7-Steps process).

<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) are considering a partnership with industry to develop a fish friendly turbine.  The goal of the project is to employ the latest technologies in turbine design and a ssessment as a proof of concept to support fish friendly or environmental based designs.  The resulting prototype turbine would be a replacement installed at the Corps' existing Ice Harbor power station replacing Ice Harbor Unit 2.  We expect to issue a tw o phase contract: Phase I, interactive and iterative design in association with the Corps of Engineers through a negotiated cost plus fixed fee arrangement; and Phase II, a cost plus incentive fee arrangement  for fabrication and delivery of a prototype, a nd technical engineering field support for installation of the prototype, which will be accomplished by a separate contract.  The draft solicitation, No. W912EF-07-R-0004, has been posted on the FedTeDS website.  Proposals are not solicited, and no award w ill be made as a result of the draft solicitation.  The purpose of the draft is to elicit industry comment prior to the Governments issuance of a formal Request for Proposal.  Comments about the draft solicitation should be received by February 15, 2008. The period of Feb 25-29, 2008 has been reserved for meetings with firms who wish to discuss the draft solicitation with the Government acquisition team.  Meetings may be conducted by phone or in person at the Walla Walla District Corps of Engineers office at 201 N. Third Ave, Walla Walla, WA.  If foreign nationals plan to attend a meeting, they must submit copies of their passports and visas, preferable in PDF format, to the security officer at the Walla Walla Corps of Engineers District Office.  It general ly takes 3-4 weeks to process the approval.  For further details, see Notice to Interested Parties posted with the FedTeDS documents for this project. Please indicate your interest and submit any comments to Phyllis Buerstatte, Contract Specialist, 201 N. Third Ave, Walla Walla, WA 99362 or by email to Phyllis.L.Buerstatte@usace.army.mil  NAICS code is 333611.

<DESC>On December 28, 2007, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) published an announcement in the Federal Register (Vol. 72, No. 248) informing industry of the states in which there are no In-State Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs) (formerly known as Peer Review Organizations (PROs).  These states are:  Maine, Vermont, Idaho and Wyoming (Please note for the States of Alaska and South Carolina refer to the Fed Biz Opps Notice published on January 2, 2008 for Solicitation Number CMS-2007-QIO9thSOW-NAHC).  CMS is soliciting proposals from qualified In-State QIOs for these states.  To quality as an In-State QIO, an organization must meet the definition of Section 1153(i)(3) of the Social Security Act which states, that an In-State organization is an organization that has its primary place of business in the State in which review will be conducted (or, which is owned by a parent corporation the headquarters of which is located in such state).  To be eligible for a QIO contract, an organization must satisfactorily demonstrate physician-sponsorship or physician-access as defined in Sections 1152 and 1153 of the Act at the time its proposal is submitted.  In addition, an organization must not be a health care facility, health care facility association, health care facility affiliate or payor organization; and must have a consumer representative on its governing board.  QIOs are responsible for review of certain health care services furnished under Title XVIII of the Act in addition to working to improve the quality of care provided to Medicare beneficiaries.  Each QIO is responsible for meeting all requirements as defined in the RFP and resultant contract.  The period of performance will be for three (3) years.  The RFP is anticipated to be released on the Federal Business Opportunities website on January 18, 2008.  Industry is further informed that in the event there are no qualified In-State QIOs eligible to respond to the RFP for the States of Maine, Vermont, Idaho and Wyoming, CMS will only consider proposals from the QIOs who currently hold the 8th SOW contract for these states.

<DESC>This is a time-sensitive Request For Information (RFI) with regard to a possible change in the current CO2 PFE bottles. Specification MIL-DTL-32238(AS)follows; PDF copies available upon request. Comments will be considered from interested applicants from our staff, reviewers, and other members of the research team.  This RFI is for planning purposes and information only and should not be construed as a solicitation for applications or an obligation on the part of the government.All interested sources with qualified systems are encouraged to respond to this synopsis to identify their devices, the qualifications and production status no later than 03 DEC 2007 and should be forwarded to address below.

Background - 

The Naval Air systems Command, Department of the Navy, and all Department of Defense agencies are considering the use of a hand-held rechargeable fire extinguisher containing 2.5 pounds of halocarbon HFC-236fa with a mounting bracket. NAVAIR is considering replacing the current CO2 FE bottles with a agent called Halocarbon (HFC). HFC-236 is an effective replacement for providing rapid extinguishment of flames through a combination of physical and chemical mechanisms. In an effort to increase our fire fighting and environmental safety capabilities, the NAVAIR research team have suggested that our review could be improved by focusing less on experimental  details and more on key ideas and the scientific significance of this proposed project. To ensure that the DoD review process identifies the most promising scientific and technical projects, we are evaluating our research and focusing it on ideas of significance. A committee has been formed at NAVAIR to gather additional information from the external community and explore possible options. We would like your professional opinion, as possible applicant and/or reviewer, of this potential change. Information pertaining to this product  will help NAVAIRSYSCOMM, DoN, and DoD determine whether to incorporate the HFC-236fa as an appropriate fire fighting safety measure. Whether you are an applicant and/or a reviewer, please provide information on the areas provided in the military specification. A PDF file of MIL-DTL-32238(AS)15 March 2007 Detail Specification may be requested by emailing Letitia.Baker@navy.mil, or you may use the ASSIST Online database at http://assist.daps.dla.mil. All information provided should be unclassified.  Suppliers with systems that do not meet the above requirements are strongly encouraged to forward information about their systems in response to this RFI.  It is requested that information/samples be submitted NO LATER THAN 03 DEC 2007 to Ms. Letitia Baker, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (Code 2.5.2.3.1), Highway 547, Lakehurst, NJ 08733-5082, who may be reached at (732)323-1193.  Respondents are notified that a formal solicitation MAY NOT necessarily result from this RFI.  Any comments provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The Government WILL NOT PAY for any information received in response to  this RFI nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.

<DESC>A.	 General Information

     The Heartland Region, TRBO Region 5, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 6 Army, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard medical treatment facilities in Ohio, Illinois, and Kentucky announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Exam Gloves. The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of care across this Region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.  
The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Wright Patterson Air Force Base Ohio, Scott Air Force Base Illinois, Naval Health Clinics of Great Lakes Illinois, Blanchfield Army Community Hospital Ft Campbell Kentucky, and Ireland Army Community Hospital Ft Knox Kentucky.

     This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP?s Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated selection date is March 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. Point of Contact Phyllis Targett 937-257-9075 phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil

B.	Products & Performance Required

The Heartland Region is seeking product line items in the category of Exam Gloves, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below. Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $496,748.19. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales for a 12-month period. The top high volume usage lines for this project include:

GLOVE,EXAM,NITRILE,PF,ALOE,MED 901 Boxes/$72,140.51; GLOVE,EXAM,LATEX,PF,ALOE,MED
2962 Boxes/ $64,718.39; GLOVE,EXAM,NITRILE,PF,ALOE,LAR 751 Boxes/ $60,838.24;   
GLOVE,EXAM,LATEX,PF,ALOE,LAR 1467 Boxes/ $49,856.12; GLOVE,EXAM,LATEX,PF,ALOE,SMA
2402 Boxes/ $41,687.57;  GLOVE,EXAM,NITRILE,PF,ALOE,SMA 454 Boxes/ $32,695.97; GLOVE,EXAM,LATEX,PF,TEXTURED 456 Boxes/ $22,398.63; GLOVE,EXAM,LATEX,PF,TEXTURED
393 Boxes/ $18,806.50; and GLOVE,EXAM,LATEX,PF,TEXTURED 308 Boxes/ $14,961.66.

At the request of the Heartland Region Military Treatment Facilities (MTF?s) vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.

C.	Instructions to Vendors

DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil (937) 257-9075 before 4:00 P.M. EST on the specific closing date/time of this solicitation. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.

This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above that their initial submission, quotes and literature actually arrived at the Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission. 
D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Heartland Region. They are the deciding officials in this initiative.

The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor without discussion.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTF?s in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

Phase I- Technical/Company Evaluation Process

Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their ?intent to participate? and detailed responses to the technical/company criteria to the above POC by the required response date.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability of each vendor.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation. 

Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally responses to all questions in this section demonstrate that: 1) the business concern offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; 2) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services offered meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 3) the vendor has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items; 4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, a distribution agreement covering the items with Owens and Minor the current Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified) ; 5) the vendor intends to offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (failure of the vendor  to offer a discount from DAPA will result in exclusion); and 6) the vendors information provided is factually correct (any misrepresentation of information will result in exclusion of the vendor from further consideration).

The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:
1.	Vendor must have and provide a DAPA number for Exam Gloves.
2.	Exam Gloves are available in both non-sterile boxes and single sterile packages.
3.	Products available through the current Prime Vendor, Owens & Minor.
4.	Vendors must identify the brand(s) that your company manufacture or distribute your product.
5.	Vendors must identify what standards your products manufactured under?
6.	Vendors must identify which ASTM standards your products meet.
7.	Vendors must identify what materials (latex-free, vinyl, nitrile, etc) your gloves come in.
8.	Vendors must identify if your gloves are compatible with all skin types.
9.	Vendors must identify if your gloves have any additives to prevent skin irritation.
10.	Vendors must identify if your gloves come with and without powder.
11.	Vendors must identify if your gloves are made to hold wet or dry objects without slipping
12.	Vendors must identify how your product is packaged
13.	Vendors must identify sizes of your Exam Gloves and if these sizes are color-coded
14.	Vendors must identify what kind of staff training their company provides 
15.	Vendors must identify if company has history of backorders and /or recalls for the product line. Explaining the a) dates and duration, b) cause, c) resolution.

Phase II ? Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process

The TPRB will request no cost samples from the product group to be evaluated in a clinical setting at select Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship no cost samples direct to the MTF?s. A three-week period will be allotted to vendors for shipment. Samples must be received by COB at 4PM EST, 21 calendar days after request.    Failure of the vendor to deliver by the deadline will result in exclusion from further consideration in the standardization process.
  
Specific MTF?s will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert-like one to five rating scale where 1=strongly disagree, 2=disagree, 3=neutral, 4=agree and 5 = strongly agree. N/A=non-applicable. All clinical/performance criteria are equally weighted. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.75 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization. The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.75 depending on the "break" in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.75.  Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration for standardization.

To determine acceptability, a Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in an inpatient setting.

The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:

            1.  The glove fits well.
            2.  The glove has adequate flexibility.
            3.  The glove holds wet or dry objects without slipping.
            4.  The glove maintains a barrier without leakage.
            5.  The glove does not rip/tear while being donned.
            6.  Tape/labels can be easily removed from the glove.
            7.  The glove does not have an unpleasant odor.
            8.   The glove is not irritating to the skin.
            9. It is easy to identify the type and size of glove from the packaging.

Phase III-Pricing Analysis Process
After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.75 threshold (depending on the "break" in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT) will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement. Vendors will be provided fourteen (14) calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 5:00 PM  EST on the fourteenth (14th) calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above.  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.  

Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.

Anticipated selection date is March 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.

C.	Instructions to Offerors

DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil (937) 257-9075 before 5:00 P.M. EST on the specified closing date/time of this solicitation. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.  

This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region POC stated above that their initial submission, quotes and literature actually arrived at the Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Heartland Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.

The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTF?s in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

Phase I-Technical/Company Evaluation Process. Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their ?intent to participate? to the above POC by the required response date. Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor. 
Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB [and/or by the Clinical Product Team which ever fits your process] to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.

Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the business concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendor?s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items with Owens & Minor, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendor?s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

  Vendors will provide an initial response to the FBO posting and provide detailed responses to the technical/company criteria Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB [and/or by the Clinical Product Team which ever fits your process] to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.

The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:
1.	Vendor must have and provide a DAPA number for Sterile Surgical Gloves
2.	Vendor must identify if their company manufacture and/or distribute a complete line of Sterile Surgical Gloves which include but are not limited to: Powder-Free Latex and Powder-Free Non Latex .  Please provide a list of the products your company offers for this product line.
3.	Products available through the current Prime Vendor, Owens & Minor.
4.	Vendors must identify the brand(s) that your company manufacture or distribute your product.
5.	Vendors must identify what standards your products manufactured under
6.	Vendors must identify which ASTM standards your products meet.
7.	Vendors must identify what materials (latex-free, vinyl, nitrile, etc) their Sterile Surgical Gloves come in?
8.	Vendors must identify if your gloves are compatible with all skin types.
9.	Vendors must identify if your gloves have any additives to prevent skin irritation.
10.	Vendors must identify sizes of your Sterile Surgical Gloves and if these sizes are color-coded
11.	Vendors must identify if your gloves come with and without powder 
12.	Vendors must identify if your gloves are made to hold wet or dry objects without slipping
13.	Vendors must identify the barrier protection for each of the types of gloves your company offers.
14.	Vendors must identify the cuff length of your gloves and if it is sufficient to fully cover the cuff of a surgical gown.
15.	Vendors must provide information pertaining to their  recommendations of double gloving for procedures.  If it is not recommended , why not?
16.	Vendors must identify if gloves come in levels of tactile sensitivity.
17.	Vendors must identify if your gloves have any type of smell or odor.
18.	Vendors must identify how the product is packaged.
19.	Vendors must identify if your products are recyclable and/or environmentally friendly to discard.
      20. Vendors must identify what kind of staff training their company provides 
      21. Vendors must identify if company has history of backorders and /or recalls for  
            the product line. Explaining the a) dates and duration, b) cause, c) resolution.

 Phase II ? Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The multi-disciplinary Clinical Product Team (CPT) formed by the TPRB will request samples (no charge) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities.  Vendors are required to ship their no cost samples directly to the designated MTF?s and will be allowed 3 weeks (21 calendar days) from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 5PM  EST, on the (21st) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. 
  
Specific MTF?s will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert like scale, with a one to five rating. 1 = strongly disagree, 2=disagree, 3=neutral, 4=agree and 5 = strongly agree. All clinical/performance criteria are equally weighted.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.75 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or 3.75 depending on the "break" in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.75.  Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration for standardization.  

To determine acceptability, a Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below. The CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a clinical setting. 
The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:  
Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.75
1.	The glove fits well    
2.	The glove has adequate flexibility
3.	The glove holds wet or dry objects without slipping
4.	The glove maintains a barrier without leakage         
5.	The glove does not rip/tear while being donned                                    	
6.	The cuff?s fit and length are adequate for barrier protection                   	
7.	The glove does not have an unpleasant odor                                        	
8.	The glove is not irritating to the skin                                            	
9.	The glove has adequate tactile sensitivity                                                
10.	The packaging allows for easy delivery to a sterile field.

Phase III ? Pricing Analysis Process.  After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.75 threshold (depending on the "break" in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT) will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided 2 weeks (14 calendar days) to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 5:00 PM EST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above.  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.  

Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods not to exceed a total of 5 years.
The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.

Grounds Maintenance Services at the Pentagon

THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ONLY.  This is not a solicitation announcement.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement.  The Washington Headquarters Services, Acquisition and Procurement Office, is currently seeking potential Small Business Hub-Zone status contractors to perform grounds maintenance services at the Pentagon.  The Pentagon Building, the National Defense Headquarters, is located in Arlington, Virginia, across the Potomac River from Washington, DC.  The Pentagon Building is included on the National Register of Historic Places.  Landscape features associated with the Courtyard and the River Entrance Terrace are considered historic elements of great importance.  The Pentagon Complex consists of the Pentagon Building, the Remote Delivery Facility, the Pentagon Heating and Refrigeration Plant and a variety of smaller support facilities.  The majority of the Pentagon site is comprised of formal grounds that not only serve to aesthetically enhance the outward appearance of the building, but are also utilized for a variety of multi-functional purposes.  The grounds host everything from official ceremonies and special events, to impromptu meetings and recreational activities.  A smaller portion of the Pentagon grounds includes a Chesapeake Bay Resource Protection Area, which borders a 57 acre riverine tidal open-water lagoon.  Under the stewardship of the Department of Defense (DoD), this natural area now provides habitat to an ever increasing diversity of wildlife.  It should be noted, that the Pentagon has also been identified as the Energy Efficient/Environmentally Sensitive Showcase Building for DoD worldwide.  In this regard, the success of the grounds management effort is of the greatest importance, since the landscape is the most visible and identifying symbol of this showcase designation for the general public.   The Government will use responses to this sources sought synopsis to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  The acquisition will be classified under the North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) code 561730 with a small business size standard of $6.5 million (used to determine the size status of the offeror).  Interested Small Business Hub-Zone status contractors must demonstrate in their qualification statement that they are qualified to perform this requirement under this NAICS code.

Small Business Hub-Zone status contractors who believe they have the capability of providing grounds maintenance services for the Pentagon are invited to submit, in writing, sufficient information within the page limitation (maximum 3 pages) which demonstrates their ability to fulfill the requirements.  Standard company brochures are not desired.  Responses, including the contractors Small Business Hub-Zone status should be emailed to Mrs. Kortnee Stewart, kortnee.stewart.ctr@whs.mil.  Capability statements shall be submitted by 3:00 PM local time on 23 January 2008.  No feedback or evaluations will be provided regarding the information provided.  This sources sought synopsis is not a request for proposal and does not restrict the Government to a single ultimate acquisition approach.

<DESC>1.  REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION:  The ALASKA DISTRICT CORPS OF ENGINEERS requests information about the interest and capability of potential offerors for the requirement described below.  A questionnaire regarding <BR>the planned solicitation is found a t the end of this announcement.  Interested parties are requested to complete the questionnaire and provide comments on the proposed method of selection, contract type, proposed task order limitations, and maximum quantities.  The objective is to achieve m aximum competition, fulfill agency commitment to utilize small disadvantaged businesses, and to simplify and reduce lead-time for procurement of agency requirements through use of a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC). <BR><BR>2.  PROPOSED REQUIREME NT:  THE ALASKA DISTRICT CORPS OF ENGINEERS plans to solicit offers for Design-Build Construction Services and/or Construction Services, Various Locations in Alaska, classified under NAICS category 236220. Services planned to be obtained under this solicit ation include design-build construction, adapt build construction or construction from Government-furnished design for barracks and company operation facilities.  The Government has decided to involve industry in developing a regional concept to allow mult iple awards.  A multiple schedule Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Type (IDIQ) contract is anticipated.  <BR><BR>a.  Schedule A shall consist of a 3-year base period of performance for a quantity not to exceed $400,000,000.00 with 1 two-year optiona l periods of performance not exceeding $270,000,000.00 .  A $65,000,000.00 maximum ordering limitation per Task Order is anticipated with a minimum order amount of $ 20,000,000.00.  Multiple awards are anticipated for Schedule A with two or more contract a wards, set-aside under the authority of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C 637(a) for qualified contractors.  Two or more additional contract awards are anticipated for large or small business contractors under Schedule A.  An offeror may submit a proposal f or either Schedule A or B.  <BR><BR>b. Schedule B shall consist of a 3-year base period of performance not expected to exceed $400,000,000.00 with 1 two-year optional periods not to exceed $270,000,000.00. A $65,000,000.00 maximum ordering limit for Task O rders is anticipated with a $20,000,00.00 minimum order amount for Schedule B awards. Multiple awards are anticipated for Schedule B with two or more contract awards to be made under the authority of Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C 637(a) to qualified 8(a) contractors.   An offeror may submit a proposal for either Schedule A or B.  Note that Schedule B is restricted to qualified 8(a) contractors.   <BR><BR>See example schedule.<BR><BR> 3. METHOD OF SELECTION OF AWARDEES:  For Schedules A, a nd B described above, THE ALASKA DISTRICT CORPS OF ENGINEERS plans to select from 8(a), and large and small offerors using the best-value source selection method.  The planned factors for selection of awardees include the following non-price factors, liste d in descending order of importance for both the Construction and Design team members (to include credentials of proposed design team members):  <BR><BR><BR>Past performance, key personnel, experience.  Other factors to be considered are organization and m anagement, and small-business subcontracting plan where applicable.  Price/cost shall be evaluated using proposed management personnel and key personnel hourly rates, direct overhead rate applicable to management and key personnel, labor burdens for trades men exclusive of those required, if applicable, by the Davis-Bacon rates and General & Administrative overhead rate for the base period and each optional period. Costs will be evaluated for realism and affordability by comparing to the Independent Governme nt Estimate and the costs of the other offerors.  When selecting an awardee for a contract under either schedule, the price/cost element of the proposal is plan ned to be less important than the combined non-price factors in determining the best value to the Government.  The offers that present the best value to the Government non-price factors and price/cost considered shall receive an award using the Best-Value Source Selection method.  <BR><BR>4. COMPETITION OF TASK ORDERS:  For the IDIQ contract periods described herein and within the monetary limitations defined, awardees of the IDIQ contract shall have a fair opportunity to compete for Design-Build Constructi on or Construction task orders with the following exceptions:<BR><BR>(1)	Competition for Task Orders from $20,000,000.00 to $35,000,000.00 may be limited to 8(a) firm awardees in accordance with FAR 19.805-1;<BR><BR>(2)	Task Orders may also be negotiated a nd awarded for a negotiated fair and reasonable price on a sole-source basis to an IDIQ awardee under the following conditions: <BR><BR>a.	Requirements under $35,000,000.00 to 8(a) awardees; <BR><BR>b.	 Any requirement under the IDIQ maximum Task Order lim it to an 8(a) awardee owned by an Indian tribe or an Alaska Native Corporation;  (will need to add other 8(a) entities based on regions)<BR><BR>c.	Competition among IDIQ awardees would result in an unacceptable delay in fulfilling an urgent requirement;<BR ><BR>d.	Unique or highly specialized services of a quality obtainable from a single IDIQ awardee; <BR><BR>e.	In the interest of economy and efficiency for a logical follow-on order already issued under the contract where awardees were given a fair opportun ity for the original order;<BR><BR>f.	To satisfy the minimum guaranteed amount.<BR><BR>Selection of an awardee submitting a proposal for a competitive Task Order is planned to be based on the following non-price factors and or price.  The relative importan ce of factors as well as the relative importance of the non-price factors to price shall vary with Task Orders. <BR><BR>a.	Past performance on other Task Orders;<BR><BR>b.	Understanding of the Requirement;<BR><BR>c.	Schedule;<BR><BR>d.	Other predetermined factors considered important to successful completion of the individual Task Order.<BR><BR>The best-value, low-price technically acceptable, or low-price selection methods may be used to select awardees for competitive Task Orders.  <BR><BR>5.  EXERCISE OF  OPTIONS:  Past performance on Task Orders shall be a factor in determining whether an additional period of services shall be awarded under this IDIQ.  Optional periods may be exercised early if contract capacity is exceeded before the term expiration; how ever, the term or life of the contract shall be decreased accordingly. Exercise of options are solely at the discretion of the Government.<BR><BR>6.

<SUBJECT>99 -- International Broadcast Rights for Television Programming - BBC Worldwide
<DESC>COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION
(COMPUTER WORKSTATION)


This is a notice of intent to issue an order to BBC Worldwide Americas, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and is for the international television programming broadcast rights.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued.
  
This announcement constitutes the only notice, a written solicitation will not be issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all proposals received by the closing date specified in the Request for Proposal (RFP).     A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Solicitation/synopsis reference number 216473556229 is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) and incorporates the following with the word ?quoter? substituted for ?offeror?.  

Provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-22 effective 23 NOV 2007. 

	(1)  FAR 52.212-1 (Instructions to Offerors ? Commercial Items) (JAN 2005):
		(a)	Re para (a):  NAICS 512120; small business size standard is $25M.
		(b)	Note that para (k) requires quoter to be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at time order is issued and throughout performance.

	(2)	FAR 52.212-2 (Evaluation ? Commercial Items) (JAN 1999) with the following insertion in para (a) ?lowest priced technically acceptable quote with acceptable past performance.?  Technical evaluation will be whether quoted items satisfy all requirements in CLINs 0001 thru 0003 descriptions below.


This contract action for commercial items of supply incorporates DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests.  The most common method of electronic submission of payment requests is by Wide Area Workflow (WAWF.)  Options within WAWF include a, ?stand-alone? invoice and a ?combo? that includes both the payment request and the receiving document required to validate the object of the invoice has been received in an acceptable condition.  The experience of this office in the administration of electronic invoices has shown that the use of  the ?combo? invoice, when available,  will result in much quicker more accurate payment.  The matching by the WAWF system of invoices and receiving reports individually submitted by the vendor and the receiving activity routinely cause problems because they do not appear together and must be individually matched and then verified.  The use of the ?combo? does not present this problem and avoids the attendant delays associated with matching. Self registration for the use of WAWF can be accomplished at https://wawf.eb.mil/index.html . Training on the use of WAWF for the submission of invoices is available on line at http://www.wawftraining.com.  



	(3)	QUOTATIONS MUST BE RECEIVED NOT LATER THAN 2:00 PM PACIFIC TIME 02 JAN 2008 IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED.  Quotations may be emailed to Fayette.White@dodmedia.osd.mil or sent via fax to (951) 413-2432.    Due to technical issues email and fax may not result in your proposal arriving before the cut-off time, please allow extra time if you?re sending your quote via electronic means.

(4)	Quotations must include completed copy of provision at FAR 52.212-3 (Offeror Representations and Certifications ? Commercial Items) (MAR 2005) with Alt 1 (APR 2002) or indication that reps and certs are in ORCA.

CLINs 0001 through 0003 ? The contractor shall provide the Government with the International Broadcast Rights in support of the American Forces Networks, for the following television programs: Doctor Who (Year 1) for 13 each, Doctor Who (Year 2) for 14 each, and Doctor Who (Year 3) for 14 each.
The Government will issue an order to the responsible quoter, with acceptable past performance, submitting the lowest priced technically acceptable quotation.  This order will include the following referenced clauses which may be accessed electronically at www.arnet.gov:

<SUBJECT>R -- Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Modification to Contract with Abt Associates Inc.
<DESC>USAID/Jordan intends to award a sole source modification to Abt Associates under award no.  278-C-00-99-00059-00.  The estimated amount of this modification is approximately $9.75m.

The above contract was awarded to Abt Associates on a Full & Open Competition basis on June 1999 for 5 years at a total amount of $39,752,232.00.  The purpose of this contract is to implement a Primary Health Care Initiatives Project (PHCI) to develop and implement a quality improvement program for primary health care clinics throughout Jordan that includes major improvements in the delivery of reproductive health and family planning services.  The original contract included major renovation and furnishing for 40 clinics, minor renovation for 160 clinics and minor furnishing for 340 clinics.  In addition, the contract included providing highly specialized technical assistance in helping the Ministry of Health (MOH) have sustainable systems for quality assurance training and reproductive health.

During the course of the contract renovation needs exceeded the governments estimate, the MOH requested to expand the medical equipment and furniture package in order to meet the new quality standards that the project is trying to set.  In addition, the sustainability initiatives had to be expanded in order to achieve strong systems in quality, training and reproductive health.  All those needs are an expansion of the scope of work Abt Associates is already implementing. 

The required supplies and services include continuation and expansion of services and supplies of the same nature as described in the original statement of work of the original contract.  Seeking new procurement to fulfill those expanded supplies and services will be duplicative, costly, and time consuming as time is of utmost importance as USAID is committed in completing the renovation in 2004 to meet the Government of Jordan’s transformation plan goals of improved Primary Health Care.  This modification is being proposed under the authority of AIDAR 706.302-70(b) (5) for the continued provision of highly specialized services when award to another resource would result in substantial additional costs to the government or unacceptable delays.  Interested companies may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement within 15 days of publication of this notice.  In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (xv), all responsible sources may submit to the Point of Contact a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  However, this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action is solely within the discretion of the Government.  No solicitation is available.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY Superconducting Tunnel Junctions X-ray Spectrometer
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
Superconducting Tunnel Junctions X-ray Spectrometer
Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS), LLC under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license its technology Superconducting Tunnel Junctions (STJ) X-ray Spectrometer.

Background: Cryogenic detectors have been under development as energy dispersive X-ray detectors with high energy resolution for over a decade. Cryogenic detectors rely on measuring low-energy solid-state excitations as part of their detection mechanism, and therefore must be operated at temperatures typically below 1K to avoid excess thermal excitations. While the energy resolution for X-rays achieved with cryogenic detectors is an order of magnitude better than for conventional, ionization-based semiconductor detectors, most of the cryogenic detectors developed thus far suffer from slow speed.

Description:  LLNL?s X-ray spectrometers based on STJ have been developed for high-resolution soft X-ray spectroscopy. STJ consist of two superconducting thin film electrodes separated by a thin insulating tunnel barrier. They measure X-ray energies from the increase in tunneling current after X-ray absorption in one of the electrodes excites additional charge carriers above the superconducting energy gap. STJ have an energy resolution an order of magnitude higher than conventional energy-dispersive X-ray detectors based on germanium or silicon semiconductors. The short life time of X-ray induced excess charges allows detector operation at several 10,000 counts/per detector pixel. Effective area and total count rate capabilities have been increased by developing detector arrays.

	For additional technical information, refer to published articles:
	
?The superconducting high-resolution soft X-ray spectrometer at the advanced
 biological and environmental X-ray facility? Nuclear Instruments and Methods in
 Physics Research A 582 (2007) 187?189

?Energy resolution and high count rate performance of superconducting
tunnel junction x-ray spectrometers? American Institute of Physics
 Rev. Sci. Instrum. 69 .1., January 1998 

Advantages:

The high energy resolution combined with the high count rate capabilities and high quantum efficiency of STJ detectors greatly enhance the sensitivity of non-destructive analysis by X-ray spectroscopy at electron and photon sources whenever conventional semiconductor detectors lack energy resolution and grating spectrometers lack detection efficiency. This includes energy-dispersive spectroscopy at scanning-electron or X-ray microscopes for defect analysis of small particles on semiconductor wafers. It also includes fluorescence-detected X-ray absorption spectroscopy for chemical state analysis of dilute specimens at synchrotron light sources.

Compared to other superconducting detector technologies that require operating temperatures of approximately 0.1K and costly superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) preamplifiers, STJ detectors can be operated at temperatures up to approximately 0.5 K and be read out with simple FET preamplifiers at room temperature. This reduces price and improves reliability.

Potential Applications:  

There is a wide range of applications for energy-dispersive, high-resolution X-ray spectrometers with high count rate capability.  These applications include:

?	semiconductor industry material analysis by X-ray fluorescence analysis
?	total reflection X-ray fluorescence analysis or microanalysis in combination with a scanning electron microscope
?	high-resolution fluorescence-detected X-ray absorption spectroscopy at synchrotron light sources for material and life science
?	plasma diagnostics
?	EUV and X-ray astrophysics and ?-particle spectroscopy

With larger STJ detector arrays, future commercial and scientific applications may include:
?	medical X-Ray imaging
?	X-ray, UV and optical imaging in astrophysics

 
Development Status:  

Several high-resolution STJ spectrometers have been built and operated successfully since 1999. A prototype commercial instrument is currently being tested that uses a mechanical cryocooler for precooling to 4K and attains the required base temperature without the use of liquid cryogens.

LLNL has an issued patent covering this invention,  U.S. Patent No. 6,528,814 B1 ?Cryogenic, High-Resolution X-ray Detector with High Count Rate Capability?, March 4, 2003.

LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.

 HSAR 3052.209?70  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES (JUN 2006).
 
    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)? 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held? 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>Title: Workshop to Categorize Nitrogen-Sensitive Alpine and Sub-alpine Plant Species in the United States -  Meeting Planning, Facilitation, and Reporting January 3, 2008 Overview There is increasing concern on the part of national park and wildlands resource managers that increases in nitrogen (N), primarily from atmospheric deposition of oxidized and/or reduced forms of inorganic N, causes some plant species to experience increased growth and abundance, whereas other species can be out-competed and eventually eliminated from the plant community. This response is especially pronounced in plant communities that have evolved under low N supply, including many alpine and subalpine plant communities. European scientists have previously classified plant species found in a wide range of European habitats with respect to their response to changes in N supply.  Results of this classification scheme have been used to predict future changes in plant communities and to estimate the critical load of N required to prevent further nutrient enrichment impacts and to restore ecological balance.  Comparable data are not currently available for the United States.  The National Park Service (NPS) is convening a group of scientists (8) at a 2-day workshop to categorize nitrogen-sensitive alpine and sub-alpine plant species in the United States.  The workshop is being planned for Spring 2008 at the offices of the NPS Air Resources Division in Lakewood, Colorado.   The purposes of the workshop are to:  1)	Apply and adapt, as appropriate, the system of classification adopted in Europe;  2)	Develop a consensus on an analogous classification for U.S. species. The workshop is also expected to provide recommendations for: 1)	Experimental studies to classify the response of important plant species that cannot be currently classified;  2)	Modeling of vegetation community response to changes in atmospheric N loading;  3)	Estimating critical loads of atmospheric N deposition to protect against nutrient enrichments effects in  U.S. alpine/subalpine plant communities; 4)	Strategies to develop N response classification systems for other plant communities in the U.S.  Scope of Work/Tasks The contractor will assist the NPS in the following tasks:  1)	Planning a workshop to be held in Spring 2008, including refining meeting objectives and working with the NPS to select workshop dates, develop the agenda and background materials; 2)	Identifying a set of 8 scientists, including European scientists and U.S. federal agency, university, and other scientists, as appropriate, with expertise in atmospheric nitrogen deposition effects to terrestrial ecosystems and arrange for their attendance at the workshop (Note:  the attendees are expected to be primarily non-NPS scientists), for bidding purposes assume 2 European scientists, 4 National and 2 Local scientists.  3)	Facilitating the workshop discussions and taking meeting notes with results and recommendations; and 4)	Prepare draft workshop report, coordinate review of draft, and incorporate review comments into final report.  The draft report should be prepared and distributed for review within 6 weeks of the workshop, with the final report due 3 months after the workshop. The NPS will handle meeting venue arrangements and will provide audio visual equipment.  The contractor should provide a proposal for addressing the above tasks, a statement of qualifications, and a cost bid. The proposal can be either submitted electronically by        e-mail to Walter Terwey, Jr. (NPS contractor) at:walter_terwey_jr@contractor.nps.gov or delivered to 12795. West Alameda Parkway Lakewood, CO 80228 no later than 2 pm Mountain Time January 22, 2008.  Evaluation Factors Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the scope of work and provides the best value to the Government considering the stated technical factors and price.  Technical factors are listed in descending order of importance.  Evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are more important than price. 1)	Familiarity with workshop content (atmospheric N deposition, pollution effects on terrestrial ecosystems including alpine and sub-alpine systems, the European classification for N-sensitive species, ecosystem modeling, and critical load development).  2)	Past performance and experience with synthesizing and reporting on complex scientific information. 3)	Past performance and experience in facilitating workshops, meetings, and collaborative projects with multiple international, federal, university, and other scientists. 4)	Past performance and experience in workshop planning to achieve stated objectives. Evaluation of Technical Capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation, including a detailed resume and an appendix demonstrating how prior experience and/or training address the qualifications in the three main areas of Planning, Facilitation and Reporting the meeting. Quotations shall include Thee (3) to Five (5) references including names, phone numbers and e-mail addresses. These references must be able to provide substantive information about past performance and abilities.   Quotations shall include the Labor Hours, Materials, Labor Rates and Labor Categories for each sub task and for the total Quotation.  Type of Contract This will be a time and materials, not to exceed purchase order.  The NPS will be able to move funds between the tasks based upon mutual agreement. The procurement is a small business set aside not expected to exceed $24,999.00. It is anticipated that award will be made under the following NAICS codes 541618, 541620 and 541690. The following provisions apply to this acquisition:  52.204-06	Data universal numbering system (DUNS) October 2003 52.204-07	Central contractor registration July 2006 52.213-04	Terms and conditions-simplified acquisitions December 2007 (Other than commercial items) The full text of a FAR provision or clause may be accessed electronically at  http://www.arnet.gov/far/ This is an Open-Market Combined Synopsis/Solicitation for the planning, facilitation and reporting of the Nitrogen-sensitive workshop as defined herein.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Veritas Netbackup 6.5 software licenses, maintenance, and components
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-08Y014169
<RESPDATE>011008
<ARCHDATE>01312008
<CONTACT>Marie Sunday, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-443-7081, Fax 301-443-2761, Email MARIE.SUNDAY@PSC.HHS.GOV - Marie Sunday, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-443-7081, Fax 301-443-2761, Email MARIE.SUNDAY@PSC.HHS.GOV
<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services/Administration for Children and Families (ACF) has a requirement for Veritas Netbackup 6.5 software licenses, maintenance, and components to provide capability to backup servers, databases, and other intangible data to the offline media.  ACF needs this upgrade (from Version 4.5) as well as the 8x capacity of what ACF currently has, to more efficiently run their backups and protect their production, staging, and development data.  This notice constitutes a request for competitive quotes.  Due to FAR Subpart 19.102(f) - non manufacturer rule, the Small Business Set-Aside does not apply.    

Brand Name Justification:

ACF currently operates Veritas Netbackup 4.5 as the operating system for tape backups in the ACF production environment.  The ACF license has reached end of life, and they have reached a point where support no longer exists.  The ACF backup configuration is predicated on the Veritas Solution.  ACF recently acquired a new Sun Tape Library to satisfy their expanding capacity and the Veritas software is to accompany it to ensure that the existing and expanded assets can be coordinated in their new backup scheme.  The Veritas Netbackup 6.5 software is specifically needed to ensure ACF can backup both the new and the old servers.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is being issued as a request for quote (RFQ) to solicit interested and qualified vendors for the purpose of awarding a commercial Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract.  A purchase order will be awarded in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures, and all applicable provisions and clauses are incorporated and in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-22.  The applicable NAICS code is 423430, and the small business size standard is 100 employees.  All responsible sources may submit a quote that shall be considered.  Please see the line item requirements description and quantity below:

<DESC>Questions in reference to the solicitation:

-Some titles are no longer available online through agencies. We can only supply print. How should that be addressed in the response?

Answer: Where online only is unavailable we want Print & Online. If Print & online are unavailable, we want print only.

-It would appear from your previous answers to vendor questions that you would require a site license for each title requested as online for up to 2000 users. There is conflicting information in Item #4, number of simultaneous users. You cite one user at a time. That is the more economical option but does not support the need for a site license. Some online access is user id and password and others is based on email address. Explain?

Answer: Electronic resource are licensed in different ways. Where a company uses a concurrent user model, we want one concurrent user. Those that license by total population, the population is estimated at 2000(including students, which not all publishers count.) They are different, mutually exclusive licensing models and no company I know of uses both.
