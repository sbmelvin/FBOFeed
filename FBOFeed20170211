The evaluation board will prepare a selection report recommending at least five firms, in order of preference based on the combined SF 330 and discussion/interview score, that are considered to be the most highly qualified to perform the required services.  The selection authority shall review the recommendations of the evaluation board and shall, with the advice of appropriate technical and staff representatives, make the final selection.  This final selection shall be a listing, in order of preference, of the firms considered most highly qualified to perform the work.  If the firm listed as the most preferred is not the firm recommended as the most highly qualified by the evaluation board, the selection authority shall provide for the contract file a written explanation of the reason for the preference. 

All firms on the final selection list are considered  selected firms  with which the contracting officer may negotiate in accordance with FAR 36.606, beginning with the most preferred firm in the final selection.  If a mutually satisfactory contract cannot be negotiated, the contracting officer shall obtain a written final proposal revision from the firm, and notify the firm that negotiations have been terminated.  The Contracting Officer will then initiate negotiations with the next firm on the final selection list. If negotiations fail with all selected firms, the contracting officer shall refer the matter to the selection authority who, after consulting with the contracting officer as to why a contract cannot be negotiated, may direct the evaluation board to recommend additional firms in accordance with 36.602.

Questions regarding this procurement should be directed, in writing, to the Contracting Officer Megan Barr via E-mail at megan.barr@va.gov. It is the intent of the Contracting Officer to make five firm-fixed price contract awards under this solicitation.
