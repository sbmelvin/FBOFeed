This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautic (AIAA) who is the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements.  This established conference is a widely acknowledged annual event that provides a unique forum dedicated to the latest developments in the collective disciplines of structures, structural dynamics, materials, design engineering, and multidisciplinary design optimization.	It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to provide an equitable conference. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 21, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for engineering supervision, labor, equipment and transportation required to extract two test machines and ancillary equipment from facilities at NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC), disassemble the test equipment, prepare the equipment for transporation, and transport it from GRC to LaRC. This procurement is being conducted under FAR Part 12, Commercial Items, and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase this service from Tinius Olsen Testing Machine Co., Inc., who is the only known source that can satisfy agency requirements. Tinius Olsen originally designed, fabricated and installed the test machines at GRC, and own proprietary data for this equipment.  Their technical qualifications and experience provide a unique opportunity to minimize the cost of disassembly, inspection and inventory of the test machines.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for the 2003 Great Moonbuggy Race/Competition. The Great Moonbuggy Race gives undergraduate and high school students from around the nation an opportunity to apply engineering skills and develop team spirit in an activity that will enhance awareness about human exploration and development of space. Moonbuggies are built from the students' own design recreating the lunar experience of the Apollo astronauts and looking ahead to further human exploration of the solar system. Two-person crews, one male and one female, assemble their collapsible vehicles, receive a safety inspection, and power their vehicles along a simulated lunar terrain obstacle course. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the item from  U. S. Space and Rocket Center, Huntsville, Alabama, pursuant to FAR 13.106, for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  The U. S. Space and Rocket Center has a unique combination of exhibits, models and facility enhancements, such as: a space shuttle, rocket exhibits, and objects from the Apollo missions.  The U. S. Space and Rocket Center walkways are broad and easily modified to create an extensive, simulated lunar terrain course including craters, rocks, lava ridges, inclines and lunar soil.  Additionally, the area surrounding the fabricated race course is easily accessible and designed for spectators. This combination of facilities, models and exhibits is not available at another facility within a 200-mile radius of the Marshall Space Flight Center.	 The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:30 p.m. local time on March 21, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
The Defense Advance Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting proposals for DARPA’s Advanced Technology Office (ATO) to perform research, development, modeling, design, and testing to support the Dynamic Quarantine of Worm-Based Attacks Against Military Enterprise Networks program.  

The objectives of this program are to: (1) develop technologies to automatically and dynamically quarantine zero-day (or novel) worms to a peak infection proportion of 1% of vulnerable machines that would otherwise infect approximately 100% of vulnerable machines in military enterprise networks, and (2) to reduce the time to recovery after attack for mission-critical applications that run distributed over vulnerable machines from days and hours to minutes and seconds. 

The dynamic quarantine program starts with the premise that next generation computer worms will saturate military enterprise networks on the order of minutes and seconds, rather than days and hours. As such, human-centered response will be insufficient to counter the threat and to maintain mission integrity in the face of worm attacks. Military enterprise networks play a key role in the deployment and sustainment of war-fighting forces. Network-centric warfare demands robust networks that can respond automatically and dynamically to self-propagating malicious code that defines the worm-based threat. Furthermore, future worms will exploit vulnerabilities in software systems that are not known a priori. These worms are known as zero-day worms in that neither the worm, nor the vulnerability it exploits will be known a priori, and thus preventable via software patches or anti-viral signatures. Existing products, technical approaches, and organizational infrastructures are insufficient to detect and react to this threat on the time-scale and network scale necessary to counter the damage that future worms can cause.

This program seeks the definition of a strategy and development of its associated architectures, algorithms, and technology to:  (1) detect worm-based threats; (2) dynamically quarantine infections to localized sectors to prevent propagation of infections; (3) extract, compute, and distribute generalizable signatures intra-enterprise faster than worm propagation rates and inter-enterprise via peering relationships; (4) select cost-optimized and mission-aware responses to infection that will ensure the cost of the response is not greater than the cost of the stimulus event or infection; (5) clean-up, recovery, or reconstitution of data and infected systems; (6) capture worm code, analyze payload, trigger mechanisms, predict propagation vectors, identify code lineage and attribution.  

The key research challenges that must be addressed in an integrated solution are: (1) detecting and responding to highly stealthy, passive, or contagion worms, in addition to traditional scanning and topological worms; (2) reacting quicker than extremely fast-moving worms such as target-listed worms; (3) distinguishing worm traffic and behavior from legitimate traffic; (4) being robust to ambient and malicious false positives;  (5) identifying corrupted components and data to enable automatic reconstitution after attack; and (6) ensuring the cost of the response is much less than the cost of the event. 

Offerors must state in proposals their plan for providing deliverables for installation, training, manuals, etc. required for evaluation by the testing facility, as well as travel costs. Offerors should support the technical feasibility of their concept or idea and demonstrate and discuss successive phases leading toward technology development, validation and transition.  

SCOPE AND FUNDING (Dynamic Quarantine Defenses):

Subject to the terms and conditions of the DoD Appropriations Act, the Government anticipates award of two (2) to three (3) contracts/agreements to develop the capability to dynamically quarantine worms that attack military enterprise networks.  Total technology development funding is anticipated to be approximately $5.5M in Program Year (PY) 1, $9.0M in PY2, and $12.5M in PY3.  The base and option periods for this project are expected to continue through FY 2006. The Government reserves the right to change all of these values as it deems necessary. 

This effort will be divided into two phases of 18 months each. Testing will be conducted in regular intervals inside of each 18 month period. The goal of Phase I will be to develop the architecture, protocols, detection and response algorithms, and prototype implementations to dynamically quarantine worms of varied types to 10 percent of the vulnerable population of machines. At the end of 18 months, detection mechanisms must have a false alarm rate of less than or equal to 10 per day while containing all worms released on a controlled test bed to 10 percent of the vulnerable population of machines. In addition, the time to recovery for a mission-critical applications and data, running on a test-bed network infected with a worm will be less than or equal to 60 minutes after infection.  

The goal of Phase II will be to implement the architectures, protocols, and algorithms developed in Phase I into network and host devices such as logic-enhanced routers for line-speed network performance, logic-enhanced network interface cards for fine-grained host-based responses, and potentially other host-based approaches such as software instrumentation of operating systems or applications.  In addition, Phase II work will include further development and refinement of Phase I algorithms to meet Phase II goals as well as respond to increasingly stealthy and dangerous worm types. The quantitative goals for Phase II are to develop devices capable of detecting and containing worm infections to 1 percent of vulnerable machines, with a false alarm rate of less than or equal to 1 per day, while minimizing the time to recovery for mission-critical applications running on a test-bed network infected with a worm will be less than or equal to 6 minutes after infection.

Offerors should propose a Phase I base effort supporting the technical feasibility of their concept or idea and its implementation and follow-on Phase II pre-priced options that further lead toward successful completion of program go/no-go milestones.  It is envisioned that the base effort proposed will not exceed 18 months, and the successive phase or option proposed will not exceed 18 months.  Offerors should not propose total efforts exceeding 36 months.  Any such proposal doing so maybe disregarded.  

Offerors can address both Phase I and Phase II, or Phase I only. Offerors should propose an initial 18-month Phase I baseline effort, with a follow-on Phase II effort with pre-priced options. It is possible that a separate solicitation will be issued at a later date, focusing solely on the Phase II effort. Proposals that focus only on Phase II will not be considered for this solicitation. 

Any offeror may submit a proposal in accordance with the requirements and procedures identified in this BAA. These requirements and procedures include the form and format for proposals. Offerors for the technology development of dynamic quarantine defenses may be foreign firms or may team with foreign firms as long as the firm meets criteria in this solicitation and the Government is permitted to conduct business with the firm. Offerors for  the technology development of dynamic quarantine defenses may also include foreign personnel as part of their proposed resources as long as these personnel qualify technically and possess the proper security clearances ultimately required.

False positive rate	False positive rate of detector components are not exceed 1 false alarm/day. 
Time to recovery	The time to recovery for infected systems shall not exceed 6 minutes. 

These milestones were chosen in order to achieve the overall program goals within the desired timeframe for program completion. Proposers should describe how their approach will enable successful attainment of part or all of the program milestones.

TEST AND EVALUATION

Test and evaluation of approaches and technologies developed in this program will be performed by an independent third party in a government laboratory facility in Arlington, VA with government furnished equipment.  The establishment of reliable, defensible, and widely accepted benchmarks for evaluating worm defense technologies is, by itself, a challenging problem. Furthermore, the scope of possible worm attacks is very broad: different spreading mechanisms, topologies, target population demographics, ease of firewall penetration, polymorphism to thwart signature specifications, and combinations of multiple modes and/or hybrid mechanisms. Consequently, validation of dynamic quarantine defenses must adequately address this multi-faceted threat. Accordingly, DARPA seeks independently proposed approaches for the test and evaluation of dynamic quarantine approaches against the set of defined go/no-go milestones. 

Proposed approaches should address the measures to be evaluated, the assessment method, the design of experiment approach, the use of any mission-critical applications to be deployed in the networked environment and related simulated or actual workload.  Any requirements that will be placed on performers for interfaces, instrumentation, protocols or formats, should be included. Proposed approaches should address non-interference, portability, repeatability, cost-effectiveness, and security issues with test and evaluation. In addition, approaches for scaling machines such as deployment of multiple virtual machines per physical machine and approaches for clean-up and system reset after experiment runs are encouraged. Approaches that include various life-cycle validation techniques with frequent periodic validation exercises are encouraged, though only experimental validation is required for go/no-go milestone evaluation. 

Offerors should propose approaches for the test and evaluation of dynamic quarantine defenses against representative next generation computer-based worms within a closed-network environment without requiring the development of such worms. DARPA does not encourage, nor intends to fund the development of computer-based worms. Approaches that develop high-fidelity worm simulation environments, emulation via widely deployed software daemons, or other worm emulation techniques should be explored. In addition to describing approaches for representing testing of next-generation worm types and behaviors, offerors must include rationale and measures for why and to what extent the proposed worm simulation/emulation will model worms with high fidelity and how these will be used to measure dynamic quarantine defenses.  Finally, offerors for test and evaluation must describe how their own and other performers’ intellectual property, software, hardware, and data which they will execute and evaluate will be properly secured via technical and legal means. 

Offerors should support the test and evaluation of dynamic quarantine technology within DARPA’s Technology Integration Center, Arlington, VA.  Offerors should propose a base 18 month effort with a follow-on pre-priced optional 18-month effort in concert with the Dynamic Quarantine program schedule.  The proposed schedule should permit test and evaluation of technology developers’ approaches well within the 18-month time window for go/no-go milestone evaluation. Offerors should not propose total efforts exceeding 36 months.  Any such proposal doing so maybe disregarded.  Proposals for test and evaluation should clearly label their proposal as such, so as not to be construed as a technology development proposal for dynamic quarantine technologies.

SCOPE AND FUNDING (Test and Evaluation):

Subject to the terms and conditions of the DoD Appropriations Act, the Government anticipates award of a single contract/agreement to develop the capability to design experiments and evaluate dynamic quarantine defenses against malicious worm attacks on military enterprise networks.  Total test and evaluation funding is anticipated to be approximately $0.9M in Program Year (PY) 1, $1.0M in PY2, and $1.5M in PY3.  The base and option periods for this project are expected to continue through FY 2006. The Government reserves the right to change all of these values as it deems necessary. 

The test and evaluation effort will follow the program schedule of two 18-month phases. Testing will be conducted in regular intervals inside each of the 18-month periods. The goal of the test and evaluation effort is to evaluate the dynamic quarantine approaches against the program-defined go/no-go milestones. 

Offerors can address both Phase I and Phase II, or Phase I only. It is possible that, depending on what proposals are submitted, a separate solicitation will be issued at a later date, focusing solely on the Phase II test and evaluation effort. Proposals that focus only on Phase II will not be considered for this solicitation. 

Offerors’ personnel for the test and evaluation must be US citizens.  Offerors in the test and evaluation organization will not be permitted to be a technology developer within the dynamic quarantine program.

<DESC>17.	The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) plans to establish a Coast Guard Information Technology Services Solutions (CGITSS) Multiple Award Contract (MAC).  CGITSS will provide for the full range of IT service solutions for the U.S. Coast Guard, with the potential for use by organizations performing Homeland Security functions within the same department as the Coast Guard, through four primary support services functional areas:  Information Management Analysis and Planning (MAP), Information Systems Engineering (ISE) and Design, Information Systems Operations and Management (SOM), and Information Systems Security (ISS).  The attached draft requirements document contains additional information on these functional areas and the anticipated labor categories.  CGITSS will provide contracting opportunities for full and open competition, as well as set-asides for small business, 8(a), and HUBzone in all functional areas. The anticipated NAICS codes are 541511, 541512, 541513, and 541519.  The Small Business size standard is $21.0M.  CGITSS contracts will be awarded to vendors in all functional areas for which they are determined to provide the best value to the government taking technical capability, management approach, past performance and pricing into consideration.  Therefore, a vendor may receive a CGITSS contract that includes all four functional areas, three functional areas, two functional areas, or just one functional area.  CGITSS contracts will promote the use of performance based contracting, however, contracts will also accommodate the issuance of task orders for all types of pricing arrangements (firm-fixed price, time & material, cost-plus fixed fee, labor hours).  CGITSS contracts will allow for various incentive contracting features, including award fee and award term.  This means that the opportunity will exist for CGITSS contracts/task orders to go beyond the normal 5-year performance period, with possible maximum performance periods of up to 15 years.  In addition, CGITSS will require pre-approval of prime contractors teaming partners/subcontractors.  Interested vendors are invited to attend one of two planned Industry Days to be held from 9:00 A.M. till 11:00 A.M. on December 16, 2002 and from 1:30 P.M till 3:30 P.M. on December 17, 2002 at the Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20590.  The purpose of the Industry Day sessions is to kick-off the CGITSS MAC project, review the functional areas and labor categories with industry, provide additional information regarding CGITSS, provide a forum for industry to pose questions regarding the project, and obtain from industry lessons learned from their involvement with other MAC and Government Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs).  If you cannot attend an Industry Day session, you will NOT be precluded from competing for CGITSS contracts, and, you WILL be able to pose questions regarding CGITSS to the contacts identified herein even after Industry Day.   Vendors interested in attending one of the Industry Day sessions must make an advance reservation in response to this announcement.  Due to limited seating, vendors are limited to sending one representative to one Industry Day session.  Reservations must be made by e-mail to Brenda Peterson, bpeterson@comdt.uscg.mil and Dani Wildason, dwildason@comdt.uscg.mil no later than 3:00 P.M. EST on December 6, 2002.  Telephone reservations and inquiries will not be accepted.  The subject line of the e-mail should read CGITSS and the e-mail should contain only the following information:  the name of the person requesting attendance at Industry Day, full corporate name and mailing address, attendees telephone number, attendees fax number, attendees e-mail address, and preference of Industry Day dates.  These e-mail responses shall NOT contain any attachments, corporate capabilities or other corporate marketing information.  Seating at Industry Day is on a first come, first serve basis.  All vendors who respond to this announcement will receive an e-mail either confirming their attendance of an Industry Day session or indicating that their reservation could not be confirmed due to unavailability of seating.  Note that we will NOT be entertaining any questions regarding CGITSS as a result of this announcement at this time. Vendors are encouraged to submit their questions in writing at Industry Day.  Future information regarding CGITSS, including a complete list of Industry Day attendees, a complete list of all questions posed at both Industry Days and CG responses thereto, and all other vendor questions/CG responses throughout the CGITSS acquisition process, will be released to the public through this website.

<DESC>General Services Administration (GSA) is soliciting for a construction contractor to improve the appearance, accessibility, signage, function and security of the main lobby and elevator lobbies/cabs that contributes to the security of the Federal Building, U.S. Post Office and Courthouse.  PROJECT OVERVIEW: The main lobby of the Federal Building Post Office and Courthouse was planned and designed to determine the scope of this First Impression Project.  The interior walls and ceiling will remain; however, a major step taken to improve the appearance of the space was to overlay, repair, and replace the flooring.  To contribute to a more cohesive appearance the deteriorated curtain wall, elevator cabs, convector covers, wood rails and planters, and doors will be refinished.  Handicap access will be improved with power-assists added to the main exterior doors.  Way finding and signage improvements include replacing the building directory and adding bulletin boards in the elevators.  To contribute to the overall security of the building, there will be a new central security station that screens everyone entering the building instead of currently screening only the people that use the elevators.  There will be public seating in the lobby so it could be used for its intended purpose.  Contractor shall be responsible for sequencing the work in order to allow safe usage of the lobbies during construction.  SELECTION PROCESS: This procurement is issued pursuant to the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program.  Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a sealed bidding process.  The successful offeror will be the responsive and responsible firm offering the lowest evaluated bid price for the base bid and selected options.  The estimated magnitude of this project is between two hundred fifty thousand dollars and five hundred thousand dollars ($250,000.00 and $500,000.00).  The approximate duration of the contract is five months.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 236220.  This procurement is UNRESTRICTED.  For the purposes of this procurement, a concern is considered a small business if its average annual receipts are $28.5 million or less.  Joint venture offers will be considered.  The contractor’s personnel will be required to obtain security clearances prior to working on this project.  The physical protection of Federal employees, the visiting public, and facilities has always been a priority for General Services Administration (GSA).  GSA and other Government agencies are reviewing GSA’s construction and security criteria to find ways to prevent future occurrences of terrorism.  Dissemination of Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU) building information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it.

<DESC>The Naval Air System Command proposes to procure engineering support services to support the U.S. Navy’s integration of an embedded Terrain Awareness Warning System (eTAWS) capability onto a Type II PCMCIA card modified to host the eTAWS algorithm, Digital Terrain Elevation Data, and a processor on both the AN/ASQ-215 Digital Data Set (DDS) and Advanced Memory Unit (AMU) for use in the EA-6B and T-45 aircraft.  The services procured in support of the eTAWS include modifications to an existing manufactured PCMCIA card, engineering and technical support, and associated data documenting this engineering change.  Modification will include the addition of 500 megabytes of Flash memory, the addition of a commercial based Digital Signal Processor (DSP), and the incorporation of a commercially available Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).  The services will be acquired sole source basis from Smiths Aerospace - Electronic Systems, Germantown, MD.  Smiths Aerospace is the only known source that possesses the necessary technical data, knowledge, experience, and expertise to produce a PCMCIA card that can host the eTAWS code on both the DDS and AMU due to their sole ownership of the data rights to the DDS and AMU Operational Flight Programs (OFPs).

Revised price offers or quotes shall be electronically submitted by Offerors or Quoters during the DPE. Offerors or Quoters shall not submit revised pricing via any other  mechanism including (but not limited to) post, courier, fax, e-mail, or orally unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer (see paragraph D for further details).  2.

No Automatic Award Determination. The Contracting Officer has determined that price is not the only factor to be considered when determining which Offeror shall receive the contract award. Therefore, the Offeror with the lowest price at the close of the Dynamic Pricing Event may not automatically be awarded the contract or purchase order  that results from this solicitation. 3. Notification of Unsuccessful Offeror(s). The Contracting Officer shall award a contract based on all the factors identified in this solicitation.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station, Panama City, Florida, intends to conduct a limited competition between Bell Avon, Inc. of Picayune, MS and B/E Aerospace-SMR Technologies, Inc. of Fenwick, WV to award a firm fixed price contract to manufacture LCAC Deep Skirt System Components.  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) has conducted a qualification program for manufacturers fabricating LCAC flexible skirt systems. These manufacturers were qualified in accordance with Government document No. 802-6336529, LANDING CRAFT, AIR CUSHION, PROJECT PECULIAR DOCUMENT, SKIRT MATERIAL CHARACTERISTICS AND REQUIREMENTS DATED 01 APRIL, 1996, Revision C and document No. 802-6336530, LANDING CRAFT, AIR CUSHION, PROJECT PECULIAR DOCUMENT, SKIRT FABRICATION PROCEDURES da ted 01 April, 1996, Revision B.  To date only Bell Avon, Inc. and B/E Aerospace-SMR Technologies have been certified as capable of providing the required LCAC flexible skirt systems.  As such these are the only two firms capable of competing for this requirement.  Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

<DESC>General Objectives and Requirements This Statement of Work (SOW) is being issued on behalf of the U.S.  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission located at 1801 L Street NW,  Washington, D.C. 20507.  EEOC is requesting qualified Offerors to provide a  Fixed Price (FP) response to the tasks described in this SOW. Notice:   This is a summary  SOW for industry.  It is not inclusive of all  required task to complete the requirement.     Title of Project EEOC Training and Outreach Online Registration Operations Purpose of the Project The purpose of the SOW is to contract with a full service firm for  registration and payment processing services.  It is the intent of EEOC to  outsource the following: Registration Payment processing		 Electronic Marketing The following tasks may be outsourced based on feasibility: Fulfillment/Mail Production/Lettershop Operations including warehousing  and distribution Training Site Logistics  Background Current Revolving Fund Division Operation The Revolving Fund Division (RFD) is responsible for operations  relating to training, event registration, direct sales orders, payment  processing for training events and direct sales, customer contact and service,  and direct marketing.  These functions are currently being supported by  numerous database applications performing a variety of functions.  All  RFD staff are full-time and work at headquarters. Currently, the foremost methods of receipt of registration for seminars  and sign-up courses is  through the US Postal Service (USPS) and fax.   Registration is handled through the manual input of data into a  database within the Marketing, Sales and Registration System (MSRS), to  include customer specific information such as name, company name, company  address, telephone numbers, payment information, and various other data  elements.  After the participants are registered and payment has been processed,  field office staff responsible for presenting the seminar generate the  registration list and nametags via the MSRS web-based registration  system and check in registrants on the day of the seminar.  It is RFD policy  to only register individuals who have provided payment, so there are  only a small number of  walk-in participants and pay-at-the -door  registrants, usually less than 10 per seminar.  After each seminar is  completed, the field office prepares a closeout package for each seminar,  including walk-in registration information and payments collected on-site.   The package is then sent to the Customer Service Representatives for  final processing, updating of the MSRS records, and  seminar closeout.   Field staff involved in supporting the registration function are not RF  staff and the cost of their time supporting the registration function  is reimbursed to the EEOC. The RFD currently contracts out fulfillment, mailing and letttershop  operations and internally does its own email marketing. Marketing, Sales and Registration System (MSRS) The MSRS system is a web-based application utilized by RFD operations  to register and track information for all seminar and sign-up course  participants.  MSRS is a developed application with maintenance support  now being provided to RFD through the Office of Information Technology  (OIT).  The MSRS was initially designed to coordinate the registration  function between the RFD headquarters management and the PAs in the field  who manage the day-to-day operations associated with Technical  Assistance Program Seminar (TAPS).  At the time of implementation, the system  allowed for improved management of TAPS by allowing both RFD  Headquarters and field offices to access MSRS and view the registration of TAPS  participants.  In addition, it provided a central source to store data on  the type of payment, business information and individual participant  information.  Both RFD Headquarters and field staff personnel can enter  and retrieve information.  Data is available from the system for each  seminar/sign-up course and information is retrievable by registrant or  organization name.  The system can produce class lists and name tags. The MSRS uses Internet technology and a Wide Area Network with  browser-based access by RFD Headquarters and field office staffs.  The  application was built using ASP code and an Access database on the back-end.  RFD Headquarters and field office staff personnel can view and edit all  information in the MSRS.  Currently, the system does not allow any  registration process to occur directly from the Internet.  While the  registrant information is stored on a web-based application, it does not allow  for attendees to enter, view or change any personal registration  information without contacting RFD Headquarters.  This inefficiency therefore  places a large burden on RFD staff members to enter all of the data  collected for registration via phone, fax, email or mail. Financial Applications EEOC's Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) utilizes the  Department of Interior National Business Center's Federal Financial System  (FFS) to manage the general ledger, budget execution, receipt and  payment, procurement and reporting functions.  FFS was originally designed  and developed by American Management Systems headquartered in Fairfax,  VA.  RFD personnel process all registrants' accounting information  through this mainframe application. For payment processing between federal agencies, EEOC utilizes the  Intra-Governmental Payment and Collection system (IPAC).  IPAC is the  web-based interagency financial system designed and operated by the  Department of Treasury that serves to eliminate cash or check transactions  between Government agencies.  Training Events RFD is responsible for many different types of training seminars.   Training events that require  participant information collection are  entered into MSRS.  These include all Technical Assistance Program Seminars  (TAPS) and sign-up courses.  MSRS does not contain information on  product sales or customer-specific training.  The following outlines the  types of training offered by RFD: Technical Assistance Program Seminar (TAPS)¿  Seminars are conducted at  off-site locations, usually hotels or conference centers.  Between 50  and 60 such seminars are held annually. These seminars are one or two  full days in length and meals are provided, such as lunch, and snacks  during mid-morning and mid-afternoon breaks.  Breakout sessions are held  during these meetings requiring between one and three extra rooms for  these sessions.  The majority of speakers are EEOC district or  headquarters employees, but outside speakers are also utilized, usually on a  no-fee basis.  EEOC employees from  district offices located nearby handle  on-site logistics support. TAPS seminars historically average  approximately 160 people per seminar. (For specific information on locations,  see Appendix A - TAPS Locations). Half-day TAPS: These  seminars are similar in nature to the above,  however they are conducted in only half-day sessions, therefore do not  require meals to be provided. Average attendance is approximately 30  people.  The number held each year ranges from none to as many as six.   EXCEL TAPS:This multi-day seminar occurs only once per year, and is  always held at an off-site location to accommodate its size (recent ones  have been held at Atlantic City).  This  seminar is generally one week  in length with registration beginning Monday afternoon, and the final  sessions closing Friday morning. Again, this  seminar is modeled after  the standard TAPS  seminar, however because of its length requires  greater planning.  It is also much larger in scale attracting over 500  attendees last year.  In the future, additional multi-day TAPS may be  scheduled.  Sign-up Courses:Currently the only sign-up courses offered are those  delivered to Federal employees at the EEOC headquarters training site and   EEOC office sites in 5 regional federal centers (Chicago, Dallas,  Denver, San Francisco and Atlanta) and do not require on-site logistics.   Sign-up courses are either full day or multi-day, and training is  delivered by EEOC trainers.  Attendance averages approximately 30 people per  session.  Approximately 30 of these courses are taught each year.  Additional sign-up courses are planned for the future for private sector  employees and these also will be held in EEOC training facilities.  Customer Specific Training (CST):These courses are designed to deliver  EEO information on-site at corporate or  federal, state or local agency  locations.  The registration system (MSRS) is not used for these  courses and CST's require no on-site logistics support.  An agreement is made  between EEOC and the customer to deliver training at a certain price  and one payment is generated.   A limited amount of information on the  company /organization  is obtained from the agreement and tracking of  payments for on-site training is done through a WordPerfect table.  EEOC  employees located in regional offices throughout the country perform  this training.   About 200 agreements are entered into yearly covering  about 400 training events (some contracts are for more than one session).  Attendance per session  is approximately 35 people. For specific information on the EEOC or the RFD, please see our website  at www.eeoc.gov .  Current Functions & Operations The RFD staff presently perform the following functions and operations: Process  training requests (submitted on registration forms received by  mail and through direct customer contact by telephone and electronic  mail) from individuals who will attend Revolving Fund training events  (TAPS and Sign-Up Courses) and maintaining a database of key registrant  data (MSRS).  Take orders (submitted on order forms received by mail and through  direct customer contact by telephone and electronic mail) from customers  for direct sales items and maintaining a database of key customer data. Receive copies of training agreements for customer-specific training  and maintain tracking system for collection of payment. Collect training fees and direct sales payments in the form of checks,  credit cards, and electronic payments, entering collection data into an  automated accounting system, and issuing invoices when applicable. Notify customers to confirm reservations for training events. Deliver training event material to registrants and direct sales items  to customers through fulfillment. Maintain and update mailing files derived from database of key  registrant and customer data. Manage accounts receivable through collection and write-off consistent  with Federal practices. Market programs through mail and electronic means. Perform all financial management, account reconciliation and reporting  services using the IFMS.  Staff in field office presently perform the following on-site logistics  support for RF events: For TAPS Prepare statement of work for seminar location (hotel or other meeting  space) to include meeting rooms, food and audio-visuals. Review bids from hotels/other meetings spaces, visit and view sites and  negotiate contract. Design program agenda, create slide shows and handout materials and  invite outside speakers, as appropriate, and deliver all or most of the  sessions. Arrange for duplication of handout materials.  Coordinate and trouble-shoot day of seminar on-site logistics with  hotel (AV, meeting rooms,  food service and signage).  Check in participants and provide handout materials to attendees and  handle a limited number of new registrations/pay at the door payments.  Distribute and collect evaluations.   For CST Prepare agreement with company or organization client for delivery of  on-site training course(s) and send copy of agreement to RFD. Deliver training at client's site.   For Sign-Up Courses Arrange for use of EEOC space or other free or low fee space for  course. Order copies of handout materials from RFD or EEOC's Publications  Distribution Center.  Set-up AV equipment owned by EEOC and deliver training. Project Tasks and Associated Deliverables Using a Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) or equivalent application, the  Contractor must propose a solution that replaces MSRS and includes any  alternatives to the execution of current Revolving Fund functions and  operations (Section 1.4).  The goal is to increase the effectiveness and  efficiency of both manual and computer-based operations, incorporating  best business practices. The solution recommended by the Contractor  must include the ability for on-line (Web-based) registration with  electronic payment (including credit cards, invoicing, and cash  reconciliation) by RFD customers.  The system solution must include seamless and  integrated registration, sales and payment data processing with maximum use  of computer technology interfacing with EEOC's financial system,  delivery of confirmation notices to customers upon payment verification;   recording of payments through Treasury accounts, i.e., contracting using  Department of  Treasury for electronic lockbox access; and, integrating  with current EEOC IFMS and computer systems (see Appendix B).  In  addition, the RFD currently has an interagency agreement for its fulfillment  operation and has a separate contract for the lettershop mailing  operations. RFD wants to explore the possible integration of the mailing  (postal and email) and fulfillment operations with the registration  function; whereby, minimizing cost associated with data processing/mail list  management and contract administration of a single contract verse  multiple contracts. The recommended system solution must also include  electronic marketing as well as conference room scheduling and logistics  planning with hotels or conference facilities for multi-day seminars.  A  list of seminar locations is outlined in Appendix A - TAPS :locations Description of Tasks The Contractor must complete the following proposed tasks or equivalent  steps to meet the objective of this statement of work and provide the  project management with the appropriate documentation to support the  completion of the project:  Project Planning Transition to Outsourced Registration Services including direct sales Full Implementation of Registration Outsourcing Fulfillment/ Lettershop Operations (Optional) and Site Logistic Support  (Optional) Task 1:Project Planning Coordinate and Facilitate Project Kick-Off Meeting  The Contractor will coordinate a kickoff meeting with EEOC  representatives.  This initial meeting will provide a forum for all involved  parties to address any potential issues and concerns that could impact future  work activities or the delivery of required services.  This initial  meeting also will provide an opportunity to confirm project priorities,  address proposed approaches and supporting rationale, and review the  requirements of all deliverables and services to be provided during project  performance.  This meeting will provide the basis for developing the  detailed Project Management Plan and Timeline that will be delivered by  the Contractor.  The Contractor will document all discussions, action  items, and issues before submission for EEOC's review and approval. Prepare Project Management Plan and Timeline The Contractor will develop a project management plan that outlines key  activities for replacing the current system within EEOC's RFD  operations.  The plan should include key milestones and expected end products or  outcomes associated with each task.  The plan should clearly delineate  anticipated levels of both Contractor and EEOC involvement.  Review Current RFD Operations This task will require the Contractor to familiarize themselves with  RFD's current processes and procedures with a focus on what will be  necessary to transition these tasks to the Contractor.  The Contractor will  be expected to review all pertinent documentation provided by EEOC as  well as to shadow RFD personnel as they perform registration and payment  processing activities.  This information will be necessary to guarantee  complete understanding of RFD operations and ensure that Contractor  participation does not decrease overall customer satisfaction.  Prepare and Submit Periodic Status Reports The Contractor will prepare written progress reports summarizing key  project accomplishments, anticipated plans for upcoming reporting  periods, and any issues where contingency measures may be warranted.  These  written reports will be submitted on a periodic basis as specified by  EEOC.  All written reports will be submitted for EEOC's review prior to  the conduct of more formalized status meetings and/or conference calls,  which will be coordinated with EEOC in advance.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) plans to establish a Coast Guard Information Technology Services Solutions (CGITSS) Multiple Award Contract (MAC).  CGITSS will provide for the full range of IT service solutions for the U.S. Coast Guard, with the potential for use by organizations performing Homeland Security functions within the same department as the Coast Guard, through four primary support services functional areas:  Information Management Analysis and Planning (MAP), Information Systems Engineering (ISE) and Design, Information Systems Operations and Management (SOM), and Information Systems Security (ISS).  The attached draft requirements document contains additional information on these functional areas and the anticipated labor categories.  CGITSS will provide contracting opportunities for full and open competition, as well as set-asides for small business, 8(a), and HUBzone in all functional areas. The anticipated NAICS codes are 541511, 541512, 541513, and 541519.  The Small Business size standard is $21.0M.  CGITSS contracts will be awarded to vendors in all functional areas for which they are determined to provide the best value to the government taking technical capability, management approach, past performance and pricing into consideration.  Therefore, a vendor may receive a CGITSS contract that includes all four functional areas, three functional areas, two functional areas, or just one functional area.  CGITSS contracts will promote the use of performance based contracting, however, contracts will also accommodate the issuance of task orders for all types of pricing arrangements (firm-fixed price, time & material, cost-plus fixed fee, labor hours).  CGITSS contracts will allow for various incentive contracting features, including award fee and award term.  This means that the opportunity will exist for CGITSS contracts/task orders to go beyond the normal 5-year performance period, with possible maximum performance periods of up to 15 years.  In addition, CGITSS will require pre-approval of prime contractors teaming partners/subcontractors.  Interested vendors are invited to attend one of two planned Industry Days to be held from 9:00 A.M. till 11:00 A.M. on December 16, 2002 and from 1:30 P.M till 3:30 P.M. on December 17, 2002 at the Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20590.  The purpose of the Industry Day sessions is to kick-off the CGITSS MAC project, review the functional areas and labor categories with industry, provide additional information regarding CGITSS, provide a forum for industry to pose questions regarding the project, and obtain from industry lessons learned from their involvement with other MAC and Government Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs).  If you cannot attend an Industry Day session, you will NOT be precluded from competing for CGITSS contracts, and, you WILL be able to pose questions regarding CGITSS to the contacts identified herein even after Industry Day.   Vendors interested in attending one of the Industry Day sessions must make an advance reservation in response to this announcement.  Due to limited seating, vendors are limited to sending one representative to one Industry Day session.  Reservations must be made by e-mail to Brenda Peterson, bpeterson@comdt.uscg.mil and Dani Wildason, dwildason@comdt.uscg.mil no later than 3:00 P.M. EST on December 6, 2002.  Telephone reservations and inquiries will not be accepted.  The subject line of the e-mail should read CGITSS and the e-mail should contain only the following information:  the name of the person requesting attendance at Industry Day, full corporate name and mailing address, attendees telephone number, attendees fax number, attendees e-mail address, and preference of Industry Day dates.  These e-mail responses shall NOT contain any attachments, corporate capabilities or other corporate marketing information.  Seating at Industry Day is on a first come, first serve basis.  All vendors who respond to this announcement will receive an e-mail either confirming their attendance of an Industry Day session or indicating that their reservation could not be confirmed due to unavailability of seating.  Note that we will NOT be entertaining any questions regarding CGITSS as a result of this announcement at this time. Vendors are encouraged to submit their questions in writing at Industry Day.  Future information regarding CGITSS, including a complete list of Industry Day attendees, a complete list of all questions posed at both Industry Days and CG responses thereto, and all other vendor questions/CG responses throughout the CGITSS acquisition process, will be released to the public through this website.  

NO FURTHER RESERVATION REQUESTS FOR THE CGITSS INDUSTRY DAYS WILL BE ACCEPTED AS ALL SESSIONS ARE NOW FULL.  Non-availability notices will NOT be issued for reservation requests received after the date of this notice.  No further questions regarding the CGITSS project will be accepted until after the questions and answers from the Industry Days are posted in January 2003.  E-mail confirmations and further instructions will be sent to all vendors who are registered for an Industry Day session no later than December 6, 2002.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to provide an update on the CGITSS project.  In late January 2003, the Coast Guard met with the CIO of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to discuss the CGITSS project.  As a result of this meeting, it was determined that (1) the CGITSS multiple award contracts will be established for DHS department-wide use (we reiterate that this will be another tool in our contracting toolbox and NOT a mandatory vehicle) and (2) DHS Investment Review Group (IRG) approval for these contract awards is not required. Accordingly, the CGITSS project name has been changed to DHS SPIRIT (Security, Planning, and Integrated Resources for Information Technology).  Future FedBizOpps notices will reference DHS SPIRIT (formerly CGITSS).  The solicitation number remains DTCG23-03-R-CGITSS.  The anticipated procurement lead time as well as the contract ceiling presented at Industry Day Sessions and posted on this site is being revised.  We continue to work on consolidating questions and researching/preparing responses to the over 600 questions received as a result of Industry Day Sessions.  We are endeavoring to address these questions in light of the fact that the project will now result in multiple award contracts for DHS-department wide use.  Therefore, we do not anticipate having the questions and answers posted until the end of April 2003.  CONTRACTORS NOTE:  DUE TO OVERWHELMING INTEREST IN THIS REQUIREMENT, NO QUESTIONS OR ONE-ON-ONE MEETINGS REGARDING THE DHS SPIRIT PROJECT (formerly CGITSS) ARE BEING ACCEPTED.  E-MAILS OR TELEPHONIC INQUIRIES RECEIVED WILL NOT BE ADDRESSED.  All further DHS SPIRIT project information will be posted on this site as it becomes available.  Your patience is appreciated in this time of transition.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to provide an update on the CGITSS project.  In late December 2002, the Coast Guard was informed that the CGITSS project must be reviewed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Investment Review Group (IRG).  At this time, it is not known how long this review process will take.  However, the anticipated procurement lead time presented at Industry Day Sessions and posted on this site will be revised as we progress through the DHS IRG process.  We continue to work on responses to the over 600 questions received as a result of Industry Day Sessions.  Questions are being consolidated and answers are forthcoming.  However, due to the overwhelming number of questions received, we do not anticipate having the questions and answers posted until the end of February 2003.

NO ONE-ON-ONE MEETINGS HAVE BEEN OR WILL BE CONDUCTED WITH ANY VENDOR REGARDING THIS PROJECT.  All further CGITSS information will be posted on this site as it becomes available.

<DESC>THIS SOLICITATION IS HEREBY BEING ISSUED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS, INVITING FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION. This procurement will result in the award of up to five (5) separate Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) design-build Construction Contracts general building type projects(new construction and renovations) including but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facilities, medium industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical and electrical improvements, civil construction (grading, drainage, and sewage, potable water – storage and transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation, and community support type facilities for activities in the southern area of the state of Florida managed by Southern Division Naval Facilities Engineering Command. The work will be at the following primary locations: Naval Air Facility Key West, FL and area of responsibility north up to and including West Palm Beach on the East coast and Ft. Meyers on the West Coast of Florida.  Proposers will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build, Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures that result in awards based on Best Value to the Government – cost or price or other factors considered. Each contract is for one year with four option years.  The anticipated workload is $100 million over the life of all contracts and the maximum combined value of all contracts will not exceed $200 million. Projects will vary in size from around $3 million to $15 million with the average project in the $3 - $5 million range.  The successful offerors will be encouraged to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders.  Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract.  Participation in the pre-proposal conference or site visits for future task orders would be the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government.  Task orders would require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects would also require incorporation of sustainable features.  Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state.  Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase of 3 to 7 proposers (design-build teams) based on design-build factors that include:  Past Performance, Technical Qualifications (including proposed subcontractors), Management Approach and Small Business subcontracting effort.  Phase I design-build factors relate to the five (5) year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects including (new construction and renovation) but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facility, medium industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical, electrical improvements civil construction grading, drainage, sewage, potable water-storage, transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation and community support type facilities.  Only those proposers selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  In Phase II, the successful 3 to 7 Phase I offerors must submit technical and price proposals.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals would not be considered for an award.  The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution; Small Business Subcontracting Effort; and other factors that define the quality of construction.  Cost and Price proposal may include total cost; evaluation of scope/design options with the Government’s published budget for award.  The best value proposal will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts.  The other IDIQ contract(s) will be awarded to the design-build offeror(s) who provide the next most competitive proposal(s).  A minimum guarantee of $50,000 will be consideration for the award of the other IDIQ contract(s).  The minimum guarantee will be payable only if the offeror(s) are awarded no task orders over the five (5) year contract term.  Task orders would be competed among the three to five firms that were awarded an IDIQ, with each task order awarded based on best value or lowest price technically acceptable proposal.  The seed project for this solicitation is for the Repairs to Visiting Quarters, Building 438, Naval Air Facility Key West, FL.  The work is to repair deteriorated structural, mechanical, electrical, and finish systems.  Building 438 is a three-story permanent structure (25,850 SF).

The documentation must be submitted to the POC within 10  days of the electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the EPA.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 12.  The anticipated award date is 4/10/03.  See numbered note 26.

The other two are the Animal, Plant, and Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Earth (GLOBE) Program under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

The release of this draft PWS is the first step to meet the requirements. Prior to DOC/NOAA undertaking the full acquisition process, we intend to determine if our needs can be met as presented below. Firms who believe they can meet our needs are requested to respond to this Request for Comments (RFC). Comments should address the PWS and each functional area. Your response to the PWS should coincide with the numbering identifiable to the paragraph numbering contained below. Comments will only be used to determine if we should proceed with a procurement action and for the refinement of current draft specification. The Government shall not pay for any information, literature, demonstration, etc., provided to the Government as a result of this RFC. 

Responses must be submitted electronically, and to the attention of Joel Perlroth, Contracting Officer and Patsy Ybarra, Contract Specialist.  The e-mail addresses are Joel.L.Perlroth@noaa.gov and Patsy.A.Ybarra@noaa.gov.  

If desired, responses may be faxed to Mr. Perlroth on 301-258-4525 and Ms. Ybarra on 816 426-7530.  Based on industry comments, it is the Governments intent to update the PWS over the next two (2) to three (3) weeks.  

Please note that all future updates to the PWS will only be posted at http://www.rdc.noaa.gov/~casc/directors/pws.htm.   Although the system prompts you for a PWS general user id, there is NO PASSWORD necessary for complete access to the web site.  Click on OK to go directly to the desired file storage area on the FTP site.

<DESC>1.1.1	At the following locations there are facilities that should be surveyed for asbestos-containing materials (ACMs) and lead-based paint (LBP).  Due to limited resources, identification of ACM and LBP in facilities has been accomplished on an as needed basis during engineering design reviews for demolition and renovation.  To date identification of ACMs in base facilities has been accomplished by an inspector from Base Civil Engineering (BCE) or by IDIQ contract with local inspectors and labs.  Since the surveys have been completed on a partial basis, it has not allowed for a very proactive approach to asbestos management and does not meet the requirements levied upon Base Civil Engineering in Air Force Instruction 32-1052 to identify and manage ACMs.
1.2.1	This effort addresses a comprehensive physical asbestos identification survey for all listed buildings with an approximate total of 236,884 sq. ft. of floor space.  The purpose of the survey is to provide the base with a comprehensive management tool capable of quickly identifying potential asbestos and LBP hazards for facilities on base in either text or graphic formats.  This survey includes identification, sampling and analysis of suspect ACM and LBP from both the interior and exterior of these facilities.  ACM survey results will specify the type (for both friable and non-friable materials) and the quantity of ACMs in either linear or square feet, as appropriate, and specify existing health risks using the AHERA  protocol.  LBP samples are to be taken using the NITON X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) analyzer, with one (1) XRF shot to be taken of each suspect material.  Any inconclusive results are to be bulk sampled and analyzed using Flame Atomic Absorption (FAA).  Lead-based paint materials are to be assessed by condition and accessibility factors.  The final survey results and system will provide a means of planning and programming repairs, renovations, demolition projects, and prioritizing health risks or responding to emergency conditions.  The survey will provide a consistent and effective program for managing ACM in accordance with the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA) and the National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) requirements.  A database system of all readings will be developed using a Personal Computer (PC) tied into the USAF Civil Engineering computer system, to create an easily updateable database management system that is compatible with existing Luke computer hardware.  The system will allow for transfer of files and survey information between the base and headquarters and will include a workstation for the dedicated use of the Facilities and Asbestos Computerized Tracking System (ADAM*) management program .  The contractor will provide AutoCAD drawings documenting the findings of the survey.
Please call for copy of full SOW and building requirements.

<SUBJECT>75 -- REQUEST FOR IMPACT INFORMATION ON SALES OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS POTENTIALLLY AFFECTED BY A PROPOSED ADDITION TO THE COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE PROCUREMENT LIST
<DESC>This notice does not constitute a request for information, quote or proposal for procurement of products or services.  The Committee for Purchase has been asked to consider adding the below listed product(s) to its Procurement List (PL).  This action would be taken under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, whose purposes include providing employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Product(s) added to the PL must subsequently be purchased from a nonprofit agency(ies) designated by the Committee.  An addition to the PL could have severe adverse impact on a company's overall financial status.  The Committs is considering the addition of: Remanufactured Inject Cartridges (7510-01-443-2122 abd 7510-01-443-2123). In determining whether a product is suitable for addition to the PL, the Committee considers the impact on commercial firms who are providing the product(s) to the Government as MAS/BPA vendors.  Specifically, the Committee considers the potential impact on the firm's sales, and the extent to which the firm is dependent on the income from such sales to the Federal Government.  It is then the Committee's responsibility to determine whether the benefits of adding a product, or a portion thereof, to the PL offset any potential adverse impact on commercial firms. 
To determine whether the addition of the product(s) listed in this notice would have a severe adverse impact on a firm, the Committee will consider its total annual sales from all sources for the most recent 12-month period for which data is available.  It also needs to receive information on the total revenue derived by a company in the same 12-month period from the sale of the products being considered for addition to the PL.  Documents substantiating the total revenue sales figures must also be provided.  If audited data is available, it should be provided.  You may also wish to notify your employees or their representatives about this possible addition to the Procurement List. 
When the Committee assesses impact on a contractor, it takes into account the sales of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well.  If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, the Committee requests the other corporations to which the company is related and the nature of the relationship be identified, and that total sales information data is provided for the other corporations.  

If the information provided the Committee is considered confidential, please advise and it will be safeguarded.  Because of the tight time constraints associated with adding products to the PL, it is essential that the Committee receive the information by the response date indicated on this notice.  If no information is received by that date, the Committee will consider that there will be no severe adverse impact on any commercial firm should the listed product(s) be added to the PL. 
For more information concerning the Committee and its authority, refer to Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  You may also telephone Mr. Barry S. Lineback, Operations Analyst on the Committee staff, at (703) 603-0035 for further information.

<SUBJECT>D -- Notice of Intent to extend services on F04684-96-0038 (ROMSSC)
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT:  The 30th Space Wing intends to extend the Range Operations, Maintenance, and Support Services Contract (ROMSSC) #F04684-96-C-0038 with ITT Industries, for a period of six months (01 Apr 03-30 Sep 03).  By extending the ROMSSC Contract, launch critical services will be uninterrupted while the new eight year Western Range Operations, Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (WROC4) Services Contract is being competed under F04684-01-R-0008.  The current ROMSSC contract provides support to the overall diversified mission of the 14th AF, 30 SW, 30 OG, 30 CS, range operations, associated unit operations, and commercial launch agencies.  This contract provides operations, maintenance, and support services to the US Air Force, 30th Space Wing (30 SW) Western Range (WR).  The WR embraces a geographical area extending from the US West Coast to the Indian Ocean.  Instrumentation sites are located at VAFB, other California coastal sites, and in the Hawaiian Islands.  The scope of work encompasses the capability to operate and maintain control centers and Range facilities while providing for future planning, flight safety, technical studies, and analysis support.  Also included are resource control and scheduling for systems assignment, status reporting, systems maintenance and repairs, downtime modifications and real time operations.  Mobile instrumentation and measurement resources are deployed to other ranges, centers, and laboratories to meet Range customer requirements.  WR receives and provides Range support to and from Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Pacific Missile Range Facility, NASA Space Centers, 45th SW, 452 FTS, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), North American Defense Command, US Space Command (USSPACECOM), US Coast Guard, Air Force Flight Test Center, (AFFTC), and Kwajalein Missile Range.  The 30 SW is responsible for providing a fully instrumented Range capability to conduct and support activities for space lift, ballistic missile, tactical military operations and aeronautical programs.  The WR is a designated Major Range Test Facility Base in support of federal and non-federal users.  All hiring and training of personnel, learning of mission critical systems, development of O&M procedures, and obtaining of certifications and required security clearances must be accomplished without interruption of ROMSSC services or change to launch schedules.  Phase-in will not be included due to the aggressive launch schedule, the criticality of services to be provided and the impact that would result from the interruption of these services.  The incumbent contractor will not provide transition training since this would cause the government a substantial duplication of costs and an unacceptable delay to launch schedules.  Interested parties may provide necessary information, including written capabilities statement, and past performance references to Velma Davis within 5 days of this publication.
