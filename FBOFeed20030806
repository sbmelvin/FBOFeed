<DESC>NASA/SSC plans to issue a Best Value Request for Offer (RFO) for Roadway construction of Leonard Kimble Road.  The work for this requirement consists of, but is not limited to the following:  Provide all labor, equipment and materials to construct Leonard Kimble Road including 2.1 miles of overlay and 0.37 miles of new roadway.  Additionally, this work includes the following: Clearing and grubbing, installation and maintenance of erosion control measures, stripping unclassified material, base repair of existing asphalt surface, leveling of existing asphalt surface, hot bituminous pavement leveling, unclassified excavation, borrow excavation (Class 7), granular material (Class9, Group B), establishing vegetative cover, asphalt binder courses and base, signs, final surface course overlay, and striping. Best Value Selection (BVS) seeks to select an offer based on the best combination of price and qualitative merit (including past performance, and relevant experience) of the offers submitted and reduce the administrative burden on the Offerors and the Government. BVS evaluation is based on the premise that, if all offers are of approximately equal qualitative merit, award will be made to the Offeror with the lowest evaluated price (fixed-price contracts). However, the Government will consider awarding to an Offeror with higher qualitative merit if the difference in price is commensurate with added value. Conversely, the Government will consider making award to an Offeror whose offer has lower qualitative merit if the price (or cost) differential between it and other offers warrant doing so.  The order of magnitude for this procurement is $500,000 to $1,000,000, and the effort shall be completed within (180) calendar days after receipt of the notice to proceed.  This procurement is unrestricted. The NAICS Code and small business size standard for this procurement are 237310 and $28.5 million, respectively. This procurement is part of the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. As a result, all qualified sources may submit a bid, which shall be considered by the agency.	The anticipated release date of the RFO is on or about August 26, 2003, with an anticipated bid closing date of on or about September 25, 2003.  The firm date for receipt of bids or offers will be stated in the RFO.  A pre-proposal conference and site visit have been scheduled for September 9, 2003 at 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. at the South Gate Reception Center, Room 109. Offerors are requested to arrive 30 minutes early in order to receive a badge for on site access to Stennis Space Center.	Oral questions will not be accepted; but written questions will be accepted at the conclusion of the site visit. Official written answers to questions will be posted as an amendment. Offerors are encouraged to submit questions prior to the pre-proposal conference.  The Cut-off date for questions in response to the solicitation and the site visit for this project is September 11, 2003.  The clauses at 52.236-2, Differing Site Conditions, and 52.236-3, Site Investigations and Conditions Affecting the Work, will be included in any contract awarded as a result of this solicitation. Accordingly, offerors or quoters are expected to inspect the site where the work will be performed.  Offerors are strongly encouraged to attend the site visit conference to inspect the site to satisfy themselves regarding all general and local conditions that may affect the cost of contract performance, to the extent that the information is reasonably obtainable. In no event shall failure to inspect the site constitute grounds for a claim after contract award.  An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B".  Specifications and Drawings will only be made available on CDROM. Requests for copies shall be made by email to the Bid Distribution Office: Robert.S.Harris@nasa.gov or you may fax your request to (228) 688-1141.

.	Apply technology approaches to protein identification and quantitation that include separation techniques and protein detection and identification methods including high throughput mass spectrometry (SELDI-or MALDI-TOF,LC/MS,LC/tandem MS, and affinity methods such as protein chip array, peptide aptamers, and isotope-coded affinity tagging.  (This project does not include development of technologies applied to 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis.)
 
.	Facilitate technology engineering that will improve the detection and identification of proteins, digested protein fragments, and peptides in serum.
.	To provide standardized measurements enabling characterization of serum soluble proteins, the laboratories will utilize a minimum of 12 in-bred mouse strain models representing different, well-characterized cancer tumors for serum protein measurement.
.	The research project will include assessment of protein profiles (molecular signatures) from samples using two approaches: random protein identification in mouse serum and, a targeted “candidate” approach that utilizes labeled known peptides to identify specific protein moieties identified in the MS approach.
.	The laboratories will develop common resources for sharing among members of the consortium including: specimens (serum and plasma), reagents (monoclonal, polyclonal, and single chain antibodies), and data obtained from the protein measurements. 
.	The consortium will establish a data and resource-coordinating center that will facilitate communication and resource exchange for the project.
Conditions:
.	The period of performance will be two years.  The NCI-Frederick (SAIC) anticipates making awards to 1 or more consortiums (each consisting of at least 3 individual laboratories).
.	It is assumed that significant technology will be brought to and developed from research and development conducted on the project.  Data developed from the project will be placed in the public domain (publications or database).
Specific Tasks:
.	Develop plan for use of a minimum of 12 individual in-bred mouse strains for acquisition of serum and plasma.
.	Develop reagents for antibodies, proteins and peptide arrays.
.	Develop database(s) and informatics support for archiving and analysis of proteomic data
.	Develop standard assay materials, i.e., plasma, and serum, from mouse models.
.	Sponsor workshops around the design, evaluation, and analysis of technology development and project design and progress assessment.
.	Develop milestones and deliverables of interest to broad research community.
 

Interested offerors should submit an expression of interest with a statement of capabilities and a 5-page summary approach plan.

SAIC/NCI will review the Statement of Capability to determine qualified offerors to receive solicitation.  

The Statement of Capabilities and the 5-page plan should be submitted to Kim Nusbaum by August 29, 2003.

The Transceiver /Shorting Device (TSD) for semi-flush fixtures is a solid s= tate digital electronic component that is an integral part of the ALSF-2 La= mp Monitoring subsystem.  The control and monitoring (CM) unit (which is th= e brain of the system) communicates with the TSD over the existing power li= nes that connect to the lighting loops.  It sends a 4 kHz polling pulse tha= t rides over the 60Hz carrier frequency to reset the transceiver=E2=80=99s = internal counter and receives an 8 KHz tone from each of the TSDs.  The res= ponses of the TSDs are time slotted based on their addresses.  The CM=E2=80= =99s polling pulse and the TSD=E2=80=99s responses are synchronized to the = 480 V ac 60 Hz input.  The TSD is resident in the PAR 56 lamp holder, and m= onitors the health of the PAR 56 lamp.  When the lamp fails and/or deterior= ates to the point where it is outside of its operational tolerances, the TS= D provides this information to the CM.   When a lamp fails, the TSD shorts = out the secondary of a 20 amp current transformer.   Depending on how many = lights are out, a caution or failure alarm is generated.  The TSD for semi-= flush fixtures shall be impervious to moisture and water and /or encapsulat= ed in a watertight enclosure. FAA has an existing contract with New Bedford Panoramex for this equipment.=   Under this contract we have already completed first article testing, and = completed the learning curve associated with establishing and maintaining s= atisfactory production and quality control processes.  New Bedford Panorame= x also holds patents for some of the imbedded technologies, such as lamp fa= ilure detection.  To purchase from another vendor would add unacceptable ex= pense and delay to FAA=E2=80=99s ability to obtain the required equipment.

 PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:	Harare, Zimbabwe

AREA OF CONSIDERATION: 	HIV/AIDS and reproductive health programs

Due to the nature of the job, it is important to fill this position as soon as possible, but there is no specific date by when the position needs to be filled.  The position is currently vacant and is a replacement position for a previous incumbent who moved into another position.   
 
A.  POSITION:
HIV/AIDS Program Specialist

B. BACKGROUND TO USAID HIV/AIDS OFFICE
The HIV/AIDS Office in USAID/Zimbabwe is comprised of a small team of dedicated people working closely and collaboratively under a common set of guiding principles to help Zimbabweans combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic in their country.  While the epidemiological data in Zimbabwe are shocking, the team has a positive outlook, saying, ¡§We focus on remembering that even though an estimated 34% of the sexually active population are HIV positive, over 66% are not.  Our challenge is to help them stay that way and to provide care and support for the 34% that are positive.¡¨     

To meet this challenge in the rapidly deteriorating Zimbabwe environment, the team believes that it is imperative to implement a strategic and focused program that builds on USAID's comparative advantages and utilizes opportunities to complement and build synergies with other national and donor-supported HIV/AIDS programs.  To this end, the team has adopted a strategy that is closely coordinated with other donor programs and fits into and forms an integral part of the Government of Zimbabwe¡¦s (GOZ¡¦s) national approach to HIV/AIDS.

The USAID/Zimbabwe HIV/AIDS team believes that Zimbabwe¡¦s HIV/AIDS crisis cannot be viewed as only a health issue, but instead is a long-term development issue that is inexorably linked to the current food and economic crisis.  Program implementation, therefore, requires a multi-sectoral approach carried out in close coordination with both USAID and other strategic partner programs in other sectors.  The team foresees that the need for an integrated, concerted attack on HIV/AIDS will last through at least the next two generations.  The short-term strategy presented in this document will, in coordination with other donor and national efforts, assist Zimbabwe in meeting the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS (UNGASS) goals.  Continued, significant investments in HIV/AIDS will be required, however, before the epidemic will be under control.  

To have an impact on the HIV/AIDS crisis, the USAID/Zimbabwe team is committed to using best practices, such as the ABC approach to safe sex.  At the same time, USAID/Zimbabwe will learn and try new approaches.  To this end, the team believes that operations research, in conjunction with program implementation, monitoring and evaluation, is essential.  The team will use lessons learned to improve its programs, will adopt innovations when there are clear indications that new approaches are needed, and will continue to be creative and take risks.  

To address the HIV/AIDS crisis, the US Government has decided to implement a program focused on achieving the HIV/AIDS strategy as illustrated in the results framework below. USAID/Zimbabwe will achieve its ¡§HIV/AIDS crisis mitigated¡¨ strategic objective through three interrelated intermediate results (IRs).  The first IR focuses on behavior change to reduce the rate of new HIV infections.  The second IR supports the development of a supportive policy environment, including the collection and distribution of high quality data and information, which strengthens the national response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic.  The third IR responds to the need to reach those infected and affected by HIV/AIDS, particularly orphans and vulnerable children, with appropriate care, treatment and support. 
 

IR1:  	Reduced high-risk sexual behaviors
Preventing the transmission of HIV is key to achieving USAID/Zimbabwe's strategic objective of ¡§mitigating,¡¨ or making less severe, Zimbabwe¡¦s HIV/AIDS crisis under this IR, USAID will (1) support behavior change communication and community activities that reinforce behavior change and (2) encourage the use of critical preventive and supportive health care services.  

IR2:	Enhanced capacity to formulate, advocate and implement improved HIV policies
Policy frameworks at national, regional, district, and local levels are some of the most powerful determinants of the social environment for the AIDS crisis.  Good policies guide, facilitate, and empower people to respond to the crises they face.  To encourage policy change, USAID is building advocacy capacity within a broad array of public, private, civil society and faith-based  organizations and supporting improvements in the availability and quality of information and data for advocacy and policy development.  

 
Five themes will continue to serve as the focal areas for USAID¡¦s advocacy support: Women¡¦s empowerment, Speaking out and reducing stigma, Reproductive health, Youth and Children Infected and Affected by AIDS.  Changes related to these themes are expected to have a significant impact on the HIV/AIDS crisis.

CDC has been working with the MOH to re-establish the sentinel surveillance system.   This system has now begun to provide information critical to determining the way forward. Surveillance, operations research and data gathering efforts are expected to result in improved knowledge of HIV and the impact of HIV interventions, which will lead to improved planning and program implementation.

IR3:	Increased care and support of orphans, vulnerable children and individuals infected with HIV
Care and support of those affected by the HIV/AIDS pandemic is essential for achieving USAID/Zimbabwe's strategic objective.  To this end, USAID developed an expanded response to the global pandemic and began working with other donors and host country partners to help local institutions provide basic care and psychosocial support services to at least 25% of HIV-infected persons and to provide community support services to at least 25% of children affected by AIDS in high prevalence countries by the year 2007.  

HIV/AIDS Team Composition:
The SO team comprises PHN staff, including a Direct Hire Team Leader, USPSC Contractor who serves as the HIV/AIDS Advisor, two FSN HIV/AIDS Program Specialists, one HIV/AIDS Program Specialist and two FSN Project Management Assistants, along with representatives of other mission offices (the Controller's and Program offices). 

C. OBJECTIVE: 
The objective of this Contract is to obtain the services of a qualified individual to ensure the continued and smooth implementation of both the HIV/AIDS and the reproductive health programs.

The incumbent will also assist as needed in the design and management of other health program activities such as Family Planning and Reproductive Health, and contraceptive logistics/supply.

Travel:
In fulfilling position monitoring requirements, the incumbent conducts field visits as needed to rural, peri-urban, and urban sites throughout Zimbabwe to assess the status of ongoing program implementation and/or general country trends within the several sectors of Office focus.  This will be conducted on an as needed basis and is estimated to take about 10 percent of the incumbent¡¦s time.

<CONTACT>James Bieschke, Contracting Officer, 630-252-2120, james.bieschke@ch.doe.gov;Marlene Martinez, Contract Specialist, 630-252-2080, marlene.martinez@ch.doe.gov
<DESC>MOX FUEL FABRICATION FACILITY IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION The Chicago Operations Office of the Department of Energy (DOE), in support of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), plans to contract with Duke COGEMA Stone & Webster (DCS) LLC to adapt the design of the US MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) for use by the Russian Federation. The NNSA Fissile Material Disposition Program, in accordance with the DOE Record of Decision dated April 24, 2003, and as published in the Federal Register (68FR20134), intends to dispose of 34 metric tons of U.S. surplus, weapons-grade plutonium in a safe manner.  Mixed Oxide (plutonium and uranium oxide) nuclear fuel assemblies that will be manufactured at the U.S. MFFF will be irradiated in U.S. commercial light-water reactors.  As a result, the material will be transformed to the spent fuel standard, making the plutonium as difficult to recover and as unattractive for use in weapons as the plutonium in existing commercial spent fuel.  The Department of Energy awarded a contract on March 22, 1999 to Duke COGEMA Stone & Webster, LLC, currently located at 128 South Tryon Street, Charlotte, NC 28202 for both fuel fabrication and reactor irradiation services.  Under that contract, DCS has been developing the design for the domestic U.S. MFFF, including managerial and technical integration of all the required contract activities. The selection of DCS for the contract to design the domestic U.S. facility was the result of a competitive selection process.  The resulting contract included the application of certain limited rights data, owned by the DCS LLC member companies.  The DCS design of the domestic U.S. MFFF is in the final phases. The Russian Federation is pursuing the disposition of surplus weapons-grade plutonium in tandem with the U.S. efforts.  In December 2002, the Russian Federation agreed to use the DCS design of the U.S. MFFF in implementing the Russian Federation?s disposition program, to be reviewed and adapted as necessary in light of Russian legislation and standards, rules, and requirements applicable to similar facilities. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations 6.302-1, ?Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements,? it has been determined that DCS is the sole contractor that can replicate and utilize the current domestic U.S. design to the extent practicable and address the technical needs and regulatory requirements within the Russian Federation as well as meeting the proposed schedule identified in the DOE Record of Decision (68FR20134).  The DCS design incorporates commercially proven COGEMA limited rights data that are central to the successful design, construction, start-up, and operation of the facility. These data are necessary to replicate and utilize the domestic U.S. design for use in the Russian Federation.  DCS is the only contractor that can provide design control and engineering input during construction, startup, testing, and operation of the facility.  Therefore, this contract will be negotiated on a sole source basis. It is anticipated that a performance-based cost-type contract for design and licensing expertise and engineering support during construction, startup, testing, and operation of the facility will be awarded with a period of performance commencing on or about December 1, 2003 and ending December 2009.  Performance will take place primarily in Charlotte, NC, France, and the Russian Federation. The minimum requirements of the proposed contract are as follows: (a) utilize the U.S. MFFF design to the maximum extent practical for the design of the potential Russian MFFF.  Minor changes will be required to address differences in the functional requirements, site utility design, site environmental conditions, regulatory requirements within the Russian Federation, and codes and standards associated with domestic construction materials; (b) provide technical support to DOE and NNSA to establish the functional requirements for fabrication of Russian MOX fuel; (c) exercise control over the design process to ensure that the design adaptation meets the established objectives; (d) prepare drawings, specifications, supporting calculations, and analyses for the potential MFFF to be built in the Russian Federation; (e) control the technical data transfer process throughout the design phases of the project consistent with any data rights limitations; and (f) provide design control and engineering support during construction, startup, testing, and operation of the facility. See government-wide numbered note 22.  Though this contract will be negotiated on a sole source basis with DCS, all responsible sources who believe they can perform the efforts described herein may submit a proposal detailing their capabilities that will be considered by the agency. Such capability statements may be faxed to Ms. Marlene Martinez at DOE-Chicago, (630) 252-5045.

<DESC>NA NAICS Code:	541512.  Basis for Sole Source Negotiations: Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302. The United States Department of Transportation, Research and Special Programs Administration, Volpe National Transportation Center (Volpe Center), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for technical support for implementation of the DynaMIT model at the Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT).  The DynaMIT model is a traffic predictor developed by MIT.  This procurement is part of an on-going project to integrate the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) DynaMIT model at the Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT) and to test the application and viability of automatic non-recurring congestion detection and traffic  management of the integrated system.  DynaMIT will be used to determine the baseline normal traffic condition.  Once the normal condition has been set, other systems will be used, along with other data sources, to determine the occurrence of an incident.  Upon detection of an incident, DynaMIT will be used to assess the impact of the incident and to provide predictive traffic information and guidance for implementing proactive traffic management strategies to mitigate the congestion.  The objectives of the contemplated contract are: (1) to assist LADOT in integrating and testing DynaMIT, CLAIRE and AIDA for automatic non-recurrent congestion detection and traffic management; (2) to build, calibrate and validate DynaMIT using the archived data collected from the test site; and (3) to refine  DynaMIT for incorporation into the integrated software system for the online test. Volpe Center market research evinces that MIT is uniquely qualified to meet this requirement.  This notice provides an opportunity for entities to submit a capability statement clearly establishing the capability to perform the services required to meet the contract objectives stated above.  This is not a request for technical proposals and no solicitation is available.  Capability Statements, limited to twenty (20) single spaced, 12 point font, single sided pages, excluding resumes, must be submitted within fifteen (15) days from electronic posting of this notice.  A determination whether to compete the contemplated contract through competitive procurement methods based upon the Capability Statements recei ved, is solely within the discretion of the Government.   This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, the NAICS Code is 541512 and the anticipated award date is the second quarter of calendar year 2003.

<SUBJECT>A --Design of a Multistatic Radar System for the ASDE-3 Surface Surveillance Radar (Includes Bistatic Antennas and Receivers, Data Processing, Fusion, Related Analyses and Engineering Support Services)
<SOLNBR>DTRS57-03-R-20045
<RESPDATE>061803
<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Elizabeth Durkin, Contract Specialist, (617) 494-2979
<DESC>NA The John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center intends to negotiate, on a non-competitive basis, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) and AR Subpart 6.302-1, with ProSensing, Inc., located in Amherst, Massachusetts.  This effort is to support the Federal Aviation Administration’s program to investigate the major principles associated with the multistatic radar concept as applied to the Airport Surface Detection Equipment (ASDE)-3 radar system for the purpose of improving airport surveillance.  These principles include: system architecture; geometrical considerations relative to multipath target location; dependence of system performance on the number of multistatic receivers; radar cross-section behavior; antenna requirements; surface and rainfall clutter effects; bistatic  gain; resolution cell size; time synchronization; and polarimetry.  The proposed effort is a follow-on to a successful proof of concept (POC) effort that was performed by the Government with support from ProSensing, Inc., for the design and implementation of a prototype bistatic receiver and recorder system utilizing the multistatic radar principles for improving ASDE-3 performance.  Due to ProSensing, Inc.'s experience on the POC phase of this multistatic radar project, their continued effort will be both time and cost effective as it relates to bistatic receivers.  The proposed effort will entail developing an in-depth design of an ASDE-3 multistatic receiver network suitable for integration into an airport environment, including the effective combining of data from the ASDE-3 radar wit h measurements from bistatic receivers.  The design shall be to the level where a prototype can be built and tested primarily through the integration of commercial off-the-shelf components. The work shall include performing a detailed design of the prototype multistatic radar receiver, data fusion and display system that would operate in conjunction with an existing ASDE-3 radar; designing a digital receiver/signal processor card which supports the processing of the received bistatic signals; exploring implementation options for the data fusion engine; analyzing the benefits and utility of fully-polarimetric/dual polarization versus single polarization operation; developing a test plan for a field test of a prototype system; performing a study of methods for time synchronization and data l inks for bistatic sites remote to the Air Traffic Control Tower facility and the main airport terminal; and, compiling and submitting a final report.  The project shall be completed within 12 months after award of a contract.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 517910 and the small business size standard is $12.5 million.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Interested firms have fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis, to submit in writing, to the identified point of contact, clear and convincing evidence of their qualifications and/or capabilities relevant to this specific project, such as Past Performance Reports demonstrating work on comparable projects.  Such qualifications an d/or capabilities will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  Responses received after fifteen (15) calendar days, or without the required information, will be considered non-responsive to this synopsis and will not be considered.

<CONTACT>KATHERINE S. VIANO, CONTRACTING OFFICER, 781-377-7746
<DESC>ESC/NDM has been tasked with new direction with respect to the procurement of communications systems, including GEMS.  ASD/NII Memorandum dated 9 June 2003 requires all Global Information Grid (GIG) assets being developed, procured, or acquired as of 1 Oct 2003 shall be both Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) capable as well as IPv4 interoperable.  This mandate supports the DoD goal of transitioning to IPv6 for all inter- and intra-networking across DoD by FT 2008.  ASD/NII Memorandum dated 17 June 2003 requires all communications waveforms and systems that operate at or above 2MHz be JTRS/SCA compliant.  This is interpreted to mean that all transceivers/receivers that operate at or above 2MHz be in compliance with both the Software Communications Architecture and the Joint Tactical Radio System Operational Requirements Document.  In addition, these transceivers must be able to run the networking-services layer of the Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW), support internet-packed routing on the user and network sides of the radio, and must incorporate National Security Agency (NSA)-certified software programmable cryptology.  ASD/NII Memorandum dated 7 July 2003 mandates that all DoD programs will follow the Global Information Grid architecture, including its Information Assurance component, which is spearheaded by the National Security Agency.  Other directives that are applicable are the latest untailored versions of DoD Instruction 4630.8, DoD Directive 8100.1, the Joint Technical Architecture, and ESC DED 002.  Given these mandates and the inherent risks to the GEMS program associated with them, we at ESC/NDM request that all potential offerors revisit the information presented to us in response to previous Requests for Information (RFI) regarding total program cost and schedule.  Our desire is to execute a program for 130 fixed and transportable GEMS utilizing the funding profile as previously published.  We wish to have Increment I development begin in FY04, Increment I production begin the fourth quarter of FY06, but no later than the first quarter of FY07.  Initial Operational Capability (IOC) will be declared when a to be determined (TBD) number of terminals have been tested and fielded to demonstrate Increment 1 capabilities.  Increment II development should begin in FY07, and full operational capability (130 GEMS fielded with both Increments I and II capability) should be achieved before the end of FY10.  We need to know whether this program would be executable, given the existing funding profiles, existing operational requirements, and new/updated mandates.  If a funding restructure or scheduling modification of any kind is necessary to execute a totally-compliant program, we would like industry inputs regarding what funding and/or schedule changes should be considered.  To remain within the published funding profile, we are also considering program options that would either make use of existing legacy systems (assuming the attainment of waivers for a select number DoD policies identified above), or restructure development and procurement of incremental capability in a manner other than that specified in the GEMS ORD.  Industry thoughts and comments on these or other options are welcome.  Please respond to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Katherine S. Viano, at 781-377-7746 or by email at kathy.viano@hanscom.af.mil, no later than 19 August 2003.  See Numbered Note 26.

<SUBJECT>16 -- Block 2 - Patient Support Pallets (PSPs), in support of the Air Force Aeromedical Evacuation Program
<SOLNBR>F4162403R1005
<RESPDATE>082103
<CONTACT>Olga Brandt, Contract Specialist, Phone 210-536-6395, Fax 210-536-5836, Email olga.brandt@brooks.af.mil - William Keihl, Contracting Officer, Phone 210-536-6318, Fax 210-536-4535, Email william.keihl@brooks.af.mil
<DESC>Imminent retirement of the C-141 and aging of the C-9 aircraft has led to the requirement for an aeromedical evacuation system based on aircraft pallets which could be used to convert cargo aircraft for opportune patient airlift without permanent aircraft modifications.  This system would provide AMC and the overseas commands a flexible, modular capability to rapidly reconfigure airlift aircraft, to include the KC-135, KC-10, and C-17, for use in transporting various numbers and combinations of patients in order to carry out the AE mission.
It is the Air Force’s intent to negotiate on a sole source basis a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) requirements contract for one year with one option year with ARINC Engineering Services, LLC, Oklahoma City, OK under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, “Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements” for the production of Patient Support Pallets (PSP).  ARINC has completed the design and testing of a functional unit, has completed the production of the first 25 units, and delivery is complete.  A description of the anticipated effort follows.  The objective is to procure 39 PSP units.  This is to acquire commercially available and modified commercially available systems that provide aeromedical evacuation capability in the footprint of a 463L pallet, using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components to the maximum extent possible.  The primary system is the PSP.  The PSP offers flexible configurations to provide seating, litter stanchions, and medical equipment support for use on any airlift aircraft as required.  The PSPs comprise several components that can be assembled in multiple configurations for various airframes missions.  These components include:  specially modified 463L pallets, litter stanchion sets, seats, pallet spacers, and pallet ramps/extensions.  Each stanchion set will be capable of supporting three to four litters at adjustable intervals, depending on overhead clearance in particular airframe.  Spacers provide a suitable walking surface to eliminate unsafe gaps between pallets installed on cargo rollers, while ramps and extensions eliminate tripping hazards for personnel moving between a pallet surface elevated on cargo rollers and the aircraft cargo deck.  PSPs would be configurable as follows:  (1) all litter configuration with a center aisle, (2) all litter configuration with back-to-back stanchion sets, (3) all seat configuration, and (4) mixed configuration of a single stanchion set with a row of seats across a center aisle.  Operators Manuals shall be provided with each delivered PSP.
Any alternate proposal must express verifiable capabilities to deliver a tested first article for inspection.  The government will not fund testing.  Testing of the first article must conform to the standards in the following paragraphs.
Hardware testing: 
The stanchion configuration must be tested to a loading capacity of three litters at 320 lbs each and for a loading capacity of four litters: 320 lbs for the two bottom litters, 220 lbs for the third litter, and 160 lbs for the top litter.  The seat must be rated for a 260 lb person.  The pallet frame must be tested for use on the KC-10, KC-135, and C-17 airframes.  The system must function/remain intact during and after acceleration in accordance with the following loads:  9g forward, 1.5g aft, 8g down, 4g up/lateral.  Temporary and permanent deflections must neither cause serious injury nor inhibit egress.  The load path from the seat to and through the pallet must be tested.  The load path from the stanchion arms to and through the pallet must be tested.  A 1.33 safety factor on the seat belt to seat fitting must be verified by test.  A 1.33 safety factor on the seat to pallet fitting must be verified by test.  All installed equipment must restrain the full load.  Additionally, jet aircraft random and operational vibration testing must be successfully conducted while fully loaded with three and four litters per stanchion.     
Environmental testing.
Testing must demonstrate that the system can operate in a temperature range of 32 – 120 degrees F, and can be stored from – 40 to 140 degrees with relative humidity from 2 – 94%.
Contract value is estimated to be $3.9M.  Contract award is anticipated to be September 2003.  Detailed information must be submitted to the address cited below within 15 days of issuance of this synopsis.  This synopsis is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals.  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice.  Any information received will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the Government.  If no written response is received, the contract will be awarded without further notice.  Written responses need to have as a minimum,  (1) identification of company size (e.g., # of personnel, if 8A or small business, etc.), (2) facilities, (3) testing capabilities, (4) technical capabilities, (5) personnel and management capabilities, and (6) estimated delivery date.  See numbered note 25.  Submit to 311 HSW/YASK, 7980 Lindbergh Landing, Brooks City-Base, TX  78235, Attn:  William Keihl or Olga Brandt.

<DESC>National Institutes of Health, (NIH) National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cancer Diagnosis Program (CDP), plans to procure services for Bladder cancer tissue microarrays to support prognostic assay development on a sole source basis with Foundation IMIM, Dr Aiguader Road 80, Barcelona, Spain 08003.  The acquisition is being conducted under the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees. The Cancer Diagnosis Program is charged with advancing cancer diagnostics by facilitating research using human specimens and patient data.  One way to accomplish this is to create sets of reference tissues that can be used by researchers to evaluate specific cancer diagnostics.  One approach that makes parsimonious use of the tissue is to create tissue microarrays from carefully selected specimens and controls to meet specific research needs.  This project is to create three to four tissue microarrays for research on bladder cancer diagnostics.  NCI/CDP determined that there are very few collections of bladder cancer specimens and that none except the Foundation IMIM collection has the number of specimens needed with the patient data and the technology required to create the tissue microarrays necessary to accomplish this project.  The IMIM group in Barcelona, Spain has created a unique collection of paraffin block bladder cancer specimens with the precise data needed to create the planned tissue micorarrays.  Briefly, the Foundation IMIM  group has assembled a cohort (n=1365) of bladder cancer patients diagnosed between May 1997 and April 2001 in 17 hospitals from 5 geographical areas of Spain. This work was conducted with appropriate IRB approval and with patient permission to use their specimens and data for future research.   Period of Performance: Base year:  Upon award through twelve (12) months with one (1) option year.  The government cannot produce these materials because it does not have access to the required specimens and data. Foundation Imim is the only known source to the NCI that can provide the aforementioned requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must include sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine whether the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST (local Washington DC time) on August 20, 2003.  If you have any questions, please submit them in writing via electronic mail to Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent on holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Office of Justice Programs (OJP), Office on Violence Against Women (VAW) attends to award a purchase order on a sole source basis to the Corporate Sports Marketing Group, Inc, 400  Cleveland Street, 8th Floor, Clearwater, Florida 33755.  This order is for the placement of   advertisements in the Little League World Series, National and American League Championship Series, and the World Series program booklets.  It is VAW's hope, that the placement of these advertisements will urge men to become involved in the effort to end violence against women. The Office on Violence Against Women  was created in 1995  to provide leadership against domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking.  Since VAW's  inception, the Office has launched a multifaceted approach to implementing the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA),  by forging state, local and  tribal partnerships among police, prosecutors, the judiciary, victim advocates, health care providers and faith leaders.  Under  VAWA, the Office on Violence Against Women has issued  grants to  help provide victims with the protection and services they need to pursue safe and healthy lives and enable communities to hold offenders accountable for their violence.  VAW considers the  opportunity to advertise in the  Championship Program Guides  an excellent opportunity to urge men to help end the violence against women.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.

The mission of the DMNB is to elucidate the biochemical and genetic basis of hereditary neurodegenerative disorders and to develop effective therapies for patients with these conditions. The success of these treatments depends to a major extent on the ability to target the therapeutic enzymes to metabolite-storing cells. We propose to target therapeutic enzymes to hepatocytes in order to treat patients with major hereditary disorders including ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man # 311250).  This enzyme is primarily localized in the liver and specifically in the hepatocytes in this organ. The potentially therapeutic enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase is a non-glycosylated protein.  Therefore, it is unlikely that this protein will be specifically taken up by hepatocytes after its parenteral administration. The trigalactosyl ligand was previously prepared by Merck Sharp and Dohme Research Laboratories (Ponpipom MM, et al. J. Med. Chem. 1981; 24: 1388-1395). However, this compound is no longer available and the only known source to the investigator that has the interest and ability to synthesize the ligand at this time is Israel Mining Industries. This item is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 3:00 p.m. EDT, on August 12, 2003.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.  NAICS 325413

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology (LCMB), plans to procure from Carl Zeiss Inc., One Zeiss Drive, Thornwood, NY 10594, the upgrading of an existing Zeiss LSM 510 Meta System with a 405 nm diode laster, photomultiplier channel 4, software modules and inverted Axovert 200 Microscope. The upgrade will be used for advanced confocal imaging studies, for example determining the composition and time dependent changes in protein complexes formed during the activation of receptors in live cells.  This upgrade will allow NCI to observe the movement of individual proteins and intracellular organelles in stimulated cells. It will aid NCI in determining if alterations in these proteins and organelles can induce or inhibit transformation in model systems and whether they are associated with human neoplasms. The upgrade of the Zeiss LSM 510 Meta will enable more efficient performance of work that is dependent on observation of microscopic structures in live and fixed cells. The system shall:  1) be capable of photoexcitation of photo-activatable green fluorescent protein (PA-GFP) and excitation of cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and other blue fluorescent dyes such as Hoechst and Pacific Blue;  2) be capable of realtime simultaneous confocal fluorescence viewing and documentation at four wavelengths with motorized optical sectioning and image acquisition software;  3) Possess scripting software for experimental flexibility;  4) possess all the capabilities of the LSM 510 Meta for photobleaching, observation of  fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and confocal polychromatic detection; and 5) be capable of imaging living cells in flasks and chambers as well as adding cells and reagents to chambers mounted on the microscope. This system is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5.  Carl Zeiss Inc. is the only organization known to the NCI researcher that can upgrade the current Zeiss system to a system that has all the aforementioned features that are required and believed to be unique.

<DESC>In support of a Defense Advance Research Projects Agency (DARPA) research and development effort, DARPA has a requirement for the development of a system for the detection and identification of bacterial or viral pathogens. DARPA intends to enter into a sole source contract with Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) of San Diego, CA, to perform this effort. The effort is a follow-on task under an existing DARPA contract with SAIC for the continued development of a highly specialized prototype, and it is likely that award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition and would also result in unacceptable schedule delays. The research is deemed to be available only from the original source.  This Notice is intended for informational purposes only; it is not a Request for Proposals. However, interested parties should contact SAIC for subcontracting opportunities.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The contract will include administrative and technical support for records management and information collection activities and management of federal information resources.  This procurement will initially support the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) located in Arlington, Va 22202, but the USPTO will be moving to Alexandria, VA 22313-1450 during CY2003-CY2005. This will be a Labor Hour type contract with performance incentives.  The period of performance for this requirement is anticipated to be for a base period of one year and four additional one-year options.  This requirement is a Small Business Set-Aside under North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 541519 and the size standard is $21 million.  This procurement will utilize the newly issued Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG). The PTAG was published in the 2003 Federal Register (http://www.gpoaccess.gov/fr/index.html), search on “PTAG”.  Detailed submission instructions will follow in the Request for Proposal (RFP).

<DESC>The purpose of Amendment 1 to DTCG23-03-Q-OPD03 is to provide question and answers to all potential offerors and to change the total evaluated price methodology. Questions and answers are as follows; 1Q: Are there any specifications for the size and or number of He-3 tubes? 1A: The requirement is that all items must fit into the backpack.  There is no specific size or number of He-3 tubes. 2Q: Is an alternative neutron detection technology acceptable? 2A: 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items. Paragraph (e) Multiple offers clearly states ,“Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.”
3Q:  What are the sensitivity requirements for the neutron and gamma rays sensors? 3A:  There is no stated sensitivity requirement.  Sensitivity performance is related to unshielded detection (alerts) as a function of distance. 4Q:  Is there a size specification for the CsI detector? 4A: No. 5Q:  Is CsINa or CsITl preferred by the end user? 5A:  No preference. 6Q:  Is there a resolution specification for the CsI gamma detector? 6A:  No.  The intended use of the backpack is a threshold instruments not analytical instrument. 7Q:  Is the weight or the battery life more important in the assessment? 7A:  The weight is important and the operational capacity is important.  Since it can take 40 continuous hours or more to search a vessel, the backpack must have an operational capacity of 40 continuous hours. 8Q:  Is 40 hour battery life an absolute requirement or desired?
8A:  See answer 7A.  The total evaluated price is changed as follows:  The estimated annual requirement is 19 each  per year for an estimated total of 95.  The total evaluated price will be calculated by multiplying the estimated annual requirement per year and summing the five years.  All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.

One side and one end opening 20ft containers will be acceptable and one side and two end openings 20ft containers will be acceptable too. If we accept these limited access containers, I will need to purchase ten.  The Army does not want us to field two different types of containers. So the solicitation will be updated as follows:  1.  Volpe Center will purchase 7 full access 20ft ISO containers.   OR 2.  Volpe Center will purchase 10 Limited Access container (one sid e and either one or two side access 20ft ISO containers).   All containers must be the same.  If there are any further questions regarding this solicitation please contact Karen Marino by email at marinok@volpe.dot.gov.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis only for an In-Transit Visibility Satellite Tracking, Communications and Reporting System. There is NO solicitation for any action at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This sources-sought synopsis is being issued to conduct market research and determine availability of qualified sources. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor will it reimburse the interested party for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. The 15th Contracting Squadron is seeking qualified sources capable of providing all services necessary to meet the requirements for a system to provide in-transit visibility to include, but not be limited to, C-21, C-12, KC-135, and C-130 Mobility aircraft.  System must provide secure, two-way packet data communications with future provision for a full DoD encryption.  The system must be portable (carry on/off aircraft) and provide global near real-time tracking using global positioning information and provide communications to a ground station as well as to other airborne mobility aircraft.  The system must be self-contained requiring no interface to aircraft systems components with the exception of power.  An internal aircraft windshield mounted antenna is acceptable.  The system ground command and control component must be able to provide near real-time two-way packet data communications and real-time tracking of mobility assets on a global basis. No further information on this system requirement will be provided. All responses are requested to indicate if they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned small business, or HUB zone small business.  No solicitation document exists.  Interested companies are requested to identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement to Darrell Strahan, Contracting Officer, 15 CONS/LGCZ, (808) 449-6860 x613; or e-mail: Darrell.Strahan@hickam.af.mil. Additionally, respondents should identify any Government support they will require. The NAICS code for this sources sought is 513340.  A determination by the Government to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary.  The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought request. Again, this synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Responses are due no later than 11 Aug 03 from capable interested parties.  Parties expressing interest in this sources sought notice are reminded that the system must be completely provided within 30 days of contract award.

Announcement of Opening for a Contractor: 
Regional Commercial Information Provider—Tomsk, Russia

BISNIS is the U.S. Government's primary information resource center for U.S. companies exploring business opportunities in Russia and other Eurasian countries, and for Russian/Eurasian companies seeking U.S. business partners. A primary goal of BISNIS is to bring buyers and sellers together to facilitate successful business transactions.

Eurasia representatives are the primary BISNIS contact with local organizations.

BISNIS has been providing related services for several years from Tomsk for Tomsk, Kemerovo, and Irkutsk regions and intends to continue during FY2004.

<DESC>The Government plans to issue a labor hour contract for the acquisiton of a DS-101 Hybrid (CDH) Follow on Device.  The COMSEC/TRANSEC Integrated Circuit(CTIC), CTIC/DS 1001 Hybrid (CDH) is a custom hybrid microcircuit that, when embedded in a host, provides communications security.  The current CTIC and CDH do not have the capability to be reprogrammed with the latest encryption/decryption algorithms.  As cryptographic algorithms age, users of the CTIC and CDH will need the capability to reprogram the devices with the new algorithms.  A CDH Compatible Follow-on (CCF) must have the capability to be reprogrammed. The CCF may be of the same form factor as the existing CDH in response to user needs, but should be capable of other forms if needed.  This is the development of a next generation cryptographic capabilty that supports security, interoperability, flexibility and programmability, and Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) compatibility with future requirements.  The CDH Compatible Follow-on program wil analyze needs of the current systems that use the CTIC/CDH in order to capture the requirements of the CCF.  The CCF program will design a development prototype (brassboard)that will meet the functional requirements of the CTIC/CDH with expanded algorithm and key management capability(programmability).  There will be two phases to this requirement.  The Brassboard Proof-of Concept Development Phase is to develop a prototype brassboard design for a prgrammable CDH follow-on device.  The brassboard design will be used to test and demonstrate the functionality of the follow-on device.  During this phase the Government will verify that the programmable CDH follow-on meets performance and functional requirement of the existing CDH.  The reprogrammable capability will also be tested and verified.  The brassboard design is not intended to be certified by NSA, but will be designed in accordance with NSA certification standards.  It will be built to the requirements that result from a study to be accomplished during the same time of this effort. The period of performance for this phase is 12 months.  The Form Factor Development Phase will be an option to continue with this second phase of development was added to the SOO.  If the brassboard development phase is successful and the study supports continuing this effort, the option will be exercised.  The objective of this phase is to convert the brassboard design into the CDH form factor required.  The final design form factor must meet the requirements of, and be certified by NSA during the phase.  Requirements and final design are to be determined by the study results. The period of performance for this phase will be 8 months.  Secret security clearance is required.  The following depicts the evaluation criteria in order of importance:  Tehnical and Management Capabilities, Relevant past Performance, Personnel availability, and cost/price.  This requirement will be incrementally funded.

<DESC>Mail and Courier Services Study Statement of Work
									
Background

		CRS currently has three mail and freight distribution units, operating under three separate divisions: (1) Office of Information Resources Management (IRM); (2) Information Research Division (INF); and (3) Office of Finance and Administration (FIN).  Each unit handles different phases of the mail and freight distribution process.  FIN and INF both handle courier services (for pick-up and delivery of materials to, from, and between CRS locations and Congressional offices) .  

		1.	Current INF mail processing and courier services to congressional offices:  CRS maintains a special mail room wherein they sort incoming mail and books (intended for congressional offices, the CRS, or other Library offices) and from which they provide the delivery and pick-up services of mail and books for Congress.  Congressional deliveries/pick-ups are made to/from various offices in four House office buildings (the Cannon, Longworth, Rayburn, Ford buildings), three Senate office buildings (the Russell, Dirksen, and Hart buildings), and the United States Capitol building.   Mail service to congressional offices is particularly time-sensitive.

		  The special mail room operation is staffed by eleven (11) full-time contract staff. 

		2.	Current FIN mail processing and commercial courier services : CRS/FIN staff pick up the sorted mail from the CRS special mail room and deliver it to CRS offices/divisions three times daily.  CRS/FIN staff also provide pick-up services for the CRS offices/divisions and pick-up and delivery of freight and Federal Express mail from the Library’s Madison building mail facility.  The CRS Office of Finance and Administration also arranges for outside couriers needed by CRS staff.

These pick-up and delivery functions are performed by three (3) full-time CRS/FIN staff.  Arrangements for the courier service is handled by another CRS/FIN staff member; however, the workload for this activity is marginal. 

		3.	Current IRM mail processing: IRM has a pick-up service twice daily to handle the USPS mail that is forwarded from the Library’s offsite mail screening and  decontamination facility to the Library’s Madison building mail facility.  IRM staff handle the initial sorting of mail to pull out print subscriptions and  books and to deliver the remaining outside mail to the CRS special mail room, where it is sorted by CRS office/division.  Twice daily, IRM staff pick up Government Printing Office (GPO) items from the Madison building loading dock.   In addition, staff from the Services’s research divisions go to IRM to pick up daily priority newsletters, congressional documents, and monographs.


These activities are performed part-time by one (1) IRM staff and one (1) IRM contract employee.  The IRM staff member spends about 1½.hours per work day on these activities, and the contract employee spends about ½ hour per day performing his assigned duties related to this function.  The various  division staff involved in pickup of division materials range in level and just spend a few minutes of each day — usually at a set time in the early morning of each day — picking up division materials to ensure that daily subscriptions and other critical materials are available for use by the Service’s research analysts.   

		4.	CRS estimates the volume of mail and freight handled in CRS to be approximately 225,000 pieces annually.  The majority of the receipts are periodical subscriptions, books, and other research materials used in a research or Library environment. 

		5.	INF and IRM are being reorganized and consolidated under a new and different organizational structure.  Under the new organization, the work activities should be limited to that of information professionals and research assistance. 

		6.	CRS seeks (1) an independent analysis of the current mail operations; (2) a description of current best business practices for a comparably sized mail and freight distribution operation (in both commercial and Federal environments); and (3) a prioritized recommendations with an implementation plan to restructure and/or re-engineer the Service’s operation — to include possible consolidation under a single office.

	
Scope of Work

		The requirements as specified in this document shall provide for a study to assess the current CRS mail and freight distribution operations and its management of courier services; to make recommendations for achieving greater operational efficiencies in both staff and management; to offer recommendations for improving the processes related to handling mail, freight, and courier services — including the possible functional consolidation under a single office.


Requirements

		In order to gain a comprehensive understanding  of existing operations, or the status quo, and to understand fully the business requirements of the Service, the contractor will interview managers and other stakeholders involved with CRS mail and freight distribution processing and management of courier services.  The study and analysis will include but may not be limited to the following:

The study and analysis shall include recommendations for the most efficient level of staffing, the most efficient management structure, and a recommendation for using contract staff versus federal employees to perform each of the functions.

•	A transition plan for implementing recommendations.
