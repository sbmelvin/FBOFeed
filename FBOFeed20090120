SCOPE OF SERVICES
The wellness services to be provided under this subcontract shall conform, at a minimum to health and weUness services specified in the Job Corps Federal Regulations (Title 20 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 638.510), in the Job Corps Policy and Requirements Handbook (PRH), Chapter 5 and applicable Technical Assistance Guides (TAGs). To accomplish these ends, the Center Physician shall:
A. Provide wellness services for a maximum of twelve (12) hours per week. Any additional hours must be approved in advance by the Center Director. The services will be provided at the facilities located at the Center Wellness Services Clinic. Center staff will provide clinical services in emergency situations only, except as provided in written health care guidelines. The Wellness Center is not authorized to provide routine treatment to staff
The maximum weeks of service will not exceed 48 weeks per year. Services are not required during DOL-mandated Center shutdowns that occur during the summer (2 weeks in July) and winter (2 weeks in December). The Subcontractor will not be paid during this period, unless the Physician is required by the Center to provide services, including call, or attend Center-mandated training during this shutdown. The Center will notify the Physician of planned shutdowns as early as practicable.
B. Develop, implement and monitor the total Center Wellness Program. Specific duties
	include, but are not limited to:

	and delivered to the Center in a timely manner.

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) will issue on 01/27/09 a Solicitation for Letters of Interest (LOIs) to U.S. Small Businesses for the development of prototype photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules. This Solicitation is in support of U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Solar America Initiative (SAI). Authorized under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the SAI represents a significant enhancement of DOE's business strategy of partnering with the U.S. industry to accelerate commercialization of PV system research and development (R&D) to meet aggressive cost and installed capacity goals. Within the framework of the SAI, this PV Technology Pre-Incubator project is positioned to bridge the gap between the concept verification stage of a technology and the development of a commercially viable prototype. This enhanced progress is achieved by taking demonstrated innovative technologies, with the potential for a disruptive improvement in solar energy production, and accelerating the transition to the prototype stage. The expected 12 month objective and result is a demonstrated PV cell or module prototype that incorporates the core innovations, meets the proposed level of performance, and is capable of meeting the entrance criteria and goals of the related SAI PV Incubator project. Subject to the availability of funds, it is the intent of NREL to award a total of approximately 5-10 firm fixed price (w/price participation) subcontracts, up to $500k each, and 12 month duration. A Net Conference regarding this Solicitation is scheduled for Tuesday, February 10, 2009, 9:30 A.M. Mountain Time.  The Solicitation is available to view/download from NREL's website at http://www.nrel.gov/business_opportunities/solicitations_rfps.html

<DESC>Contracting Office Address:
Department of the Navy, Naval Air Systems Command, NAVAIR HQ, Building 2272, 47123 Buse Road Unit IPT, Patuxent River, MD 20670, UNITED STATES




This notice N00019-09-R-0226 (previously N00019-08-R-0057) is to provide industry additional information on the flight demonstration phase of the STUAS/Tier II UAS Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) (formerly referred to as System Development and Demonstration (SDD)) solicitation to include flight demonstration details and visit request requirements.  An EMD Request for Proposal (RFP) is forthcoming that will require timely and complete RFP proposal submission in order to participate in the flight demonstration phase.  Additionally, range clearance information as outlined below is also required.

The flight demonstration will provide offerors the opportunity to display the capabilities of their systems through the conduct of actual flight operations on the Naval Air Warfare Center (Weapons Division) (NAWCWD) China Lake range.  A typical system is defined as a ground control station, at least one operational air vehicle with payload, launch and recovery equipment, and sufficient support equipment, supplies and consumables to support a minimum of 10 hours of flight operations.  Each offeror will be provided the opportunity to conduct two flights targeting 10 flight hours within a consecutive two day period. The demonstration will be conducted using a Government provided demonstration plan which will be provided in a follow-on FedBizOpps announcement.  

In order to participate in the demonstration you must have submitted a proposal (RFP  forthcoming) as the demonstration will take place after proposal submission.  Also prior to the demonstration, each offeror is required to complete and submit attachments 1, 2 and 3 from the previous FedBizOpps announcement in order to receive range safety clearance to operate on the NAWCWD China Lake range.  These three attachments can also be found on the PMA-263 website at http://www.navair.navy.mil/pma263/ at the More Competition Information link accessed via the STUAS/Tier II link.

Offerors shall not submit Source Selection Information as part of any of the attachments, and, accordingly, no documents shall be marked with Source Selection or Contractor Bid and Proposal markings.  See FAR 2.101 and 3.104.   

Attachment 1  Range Safety Questionnaire.  The purpose of this questionnaire is to collect background information in order to identify any potential hazards or risk areas the UAS may pose to range operations.  It is ultimately used to gain a range safety clearance to allow operations on the NAWCWD China Lake range.  

Attachment 2  Radio Frequency Allocation Request.  This request must be completed to participate in the demonstration in order to coordinate frequency allocations for each system.  

Attachment 3  Laser Information Sheet.  For those systems that include a laser, a Laser Information Sheet must also be completed.  In the event the system does not employ a laser, return the Laser Information Sheet clearly noting that the system does not employ a laser.

It must be emphasized that attachments 1, 2 and 3 are required in order to gain a range safety clearance to operate on the NAWCWD China Lake range.  

Each offeror who plans to submit a proposal and participate in the demonstration must submit hard copies of completed attachments 1, 2 and 3 postmarked by 6 February 2009 to NAWCAD China Lake Range at:



Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division BLDG 31455
Range Control Center Range Safety Office Code 52330MD
China Lake CA 93555
POC: Stephen R. Sutton

Attachments should include offeror point of contact information to include name, email address and phone number.  A Range Safety point of contact will be assigned and will contact the offeror point of contact to facilitate checklist review and range clearance.


In addition, offerors are requested to email shipment confirmation to:

- Greg Oliver, PMA-263 Assistant Program Manager for Test and Evaluation.  
   	Email:  gregory.oliver@navy.mil
- Art Amses (AIR 2.4.4.2) Contract Specialist
		Email: Arthur.amses@navy.mil

Do not include completed attachments unless email can be encrypted with PKI technology. 


Offerors who require the inclusion of foreign nationals as part of their demonstration team are required to have the foreign nationals submit an official visit request through their respective embassy in order to gain access to the NAWCWD China Lake range.  The point of contact for coordinating official visit requests for the demonstration is:

- Carolyn Schmidt, Foreign Clearance Officer (FCO). 
  	Phone:  (760) 939-5472
  	Email: carolyn.schmidt.ctr@navy.mil 
	Company information for Ms. Carolyn Schmidt: Naval Systems Inc. (NSI), 21491 Great
	Mills Rd, Suite 100, Lexington Park, MD 20653.  Phone: 301-737-1911

It is important to note that the official visit request process typically takes three months or more; therefore, potential foreign visitors participating at the request of a U.S. demonstration participant should begin this process as soon as possible.

The demonstration is planned to be conducted during a period that starts no earlier than 01 May 2009 and concludes no later than 30 June 2009.  Release of an updated competition timeline is anticipated in the near future to facilitate planning.    After final RFP release, a site visit to the actual demonstration location on the NAWCWD China Lake range will be scheduled for offerors to attend at their own expense.   The Government intends to conduct a random drawing of offerors who have submitted final proposals to determine the order in which offerors will be asked to conduct their demonstration.

Each offeror who plans to submit a proposal and requests to participate in the demonstration plan may send no more than two representatives to the site visit.  It is not anticipated that sufficient time will be permitted to process any foreign national visit requests; therefore, only U.S. citizens will be permitted access for the site visit.  Actual dates for the demonstration and site visit will be provided in a follow-on amendment to notice N00019-09-R-0226 (previously N00019-08-R-0057).

This announcement is not a contract, request for proposal, promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind on the part of the Government. The Navy will not assume liability for any costs incurred for review of the provided information or for any costs associated with offerors participation in this procurement; therefore, offeror cost in response to this notice is not considered an allowable direct charge to the Government.  Within the facilities restrictions or parameters, use of government range time will be provided at no cost to offerors.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development (HUD) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for closing agent services for single family properties owned by HUD in one geographic area, the state of Arkansas.  HUD intends to award one contract to cover the state of Arkansas, which includes the following counties:  Arkansas, Ashley, Baxter, Benton, Boone, Calhoun, Carroll, Clark, Clay, Cleburne, Columbia, Conway, Craighead, Crawford, Crittenden, Cross, Desha, Drew, Faulkner, Franklin, Garland, Grant, Greene, Hempstead, Hot Spring, Independence, Izard, Jackson, Jefferson, Johnson, Lawrence, Lincoln, Little River, Logan, Lonoke, Madison, Miller, Mississippi, Ouachita, Phillips, Poinsett, Polk, Pope, Pulaski, Randolph, Saline, Scott, Sebastian, Sevier, Union, Van Buren, Washington, White, Woodruff, Yell.  The primary objective is to perform closings on HUD-owned properties as quickly as possible, within 50 miles of the subject property.   A purchaser is normally allowed 30-60 calendar days to close a transaction, however, sometimes HUD may offer special incentive programs to homebuyers to close in a shorter period of time, such as 15 days after contract signing.  The contractor is expected to coordinate with the Management and Marketing contractor (M&M) to accomplish the closings within the allotted timeframes unless an extension is necessary due to circumstances outside of the contractors control.   The contract will be performance-based with incentives and disincentives.  The contract duration will be for one year with three one-year options.  This is a total small business set-aside.  More detailed information concerning the work requirements will be provided in the solicitation.  The solicitation should be available for downloading from the Federal Business Opportunity website on or about 2/9/2009.  The NAICS Code is 541191 with a size standard of $7 million.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be made available.  Telephone and email requests for the solicitation will not be accepted.  Small business concerns need to respond with a written proposal by the due state stated in the solicitation.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p>The 45th Space Wing issues this sources sought synopsis for information and planning purposes in support of the nuclear test ban treaty. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the government nor will the government pay for information solicited. The anticipated contract will provide expert technical services to the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC) in conducting a variety of projects with mixed Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M), Research and Development (R&amp;D), and limited procurement funding. These supported projects are designed to advance DoD technical capabilities in nuclear treaty monitoring, R&amp;D of advanced detection technologies to support the counter-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and other applied technologies. A portion of the effort will enhance national capabilities to detect, locate, identify, assess, and report in near-real-time all atmospheric and space nuclear detonations (NUDETs) in coordination with other government agencies. Other thrust areas include multi-phenomena sensing R&amp;D to further air, ground, and space sensor capabilities across the electromagnetic/optical spectrum. In order to effectively meet the program requirements, the contractor must have a specialized mix of professionals in defined areas of interest, including subject matter expertise in sensor systems and technologies across the electromagnetic/optical spectrum. Robust capabilities in digital signal processing, including state-of-the-art commercial tools such as (but not necessarily limited to) MatLab and LabView are also required. Other desired resources would include modeling and simulation capabilities in multi-phenomena energy propagation. Experience with AFTAC's Nuclear Detonation Detection System and familiarity with applicable national agencies and Department of Energy National Laboratories in relevant sensor system R&amp;D and data analysis software development is highly desired. Personnel must have clearances to support classified work at a level commensurate with the requirements, up to and including TS/SCI. Responders are advised that prospective offerors will be required to hold a current Top Secret facilities clearance or propose their plan to obtain one. Due to the security requirements of the work location, no work can be performed until appropriate facility and personnel clearances are obtained. All sources capable of providing these services are being sought. In addition to the information provided below, responding parties must also indicate their size status in relation to the size standard of 500 employees and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541712, R&amp;D in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences. Sources with 8(a) status or otherwise classified as a small disadvantaged business should address their status in their responses. An indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) task order type contract is contemplated with a 5-year contract period. No technical or solicitation document exists at this time. All interested firms should submit a capabilities package that outlines the firm's capabilities in providing the required services. The contractor will be required to establish Associate Contractor Agreements (ACA) with contractors supporting other AFTAC efforts. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. Recent, relevant experience in all areas should be provided. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. The response must not exceed 10 pages. Phone calls will not be accepted. Point of contact is Ms. Pat Bosinger, Contracting Officer, 45 CONS/LGCCA, 1030 South Highway A1A, MS1000, Patrick AFB, FL 32925, e-mail: pat.bosinger@patrick.af.mil.

(a) Prohibitions. 

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;
 (g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

FAR 52.217-7 OPTION FOR INCREASED QUANTITY  SEPARATELY PRICED LINE ITEM (MAR 1989)

The Government may require the performance of the numbered line items, identified in the Schedule as option items, at the unit prices stated in the Schedule.  The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only.  The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary.  Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period.  The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or both.  When time is of essence initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by a facsimile of confirmation.  A contract modification will be executed shortly thereafter to include those options wherein exercise notification was provided.  Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period.  To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option.  In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits.  The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period.  However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired.

<p><br /><strong>ANNOUNCEMENT OVERVIEW (Original)</strong></p>
<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT TITLE: Autonomous Space and Ground Systems for Space Superiority</p>
<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT NUMBER: BAA_RV_08_02</p>
<p>CATALOG OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC ASSISTANCE (CFDA) NUMBER(S): 12.800 AIR FORCE DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCES PROGRAM and 12.910 RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT</p>
<p>BRIEF PROGRAM SUMMARY: <strong>This is a 35 day Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to solicit research proposals for the United States Air Force Research Laboratory's (AFRL) Spacecraft Component Technology Branch</strong>, which is supporting the advanced decision support and autonomy efforts in Space Situational Awareness (SSA), Command and Control (C2), and Defensive CounterSpace (DCS). The technologies developed under this solicitation will provide affordable and reliable solutions to enable the next generation of Air Force space systems. This effort will require access to classified information up to and including SECRET/NOFORN; therefore, foreign owned firms are precluded from submitting proposals. This acquisition is anticipated to result in multiple awards for contracts or assistance instruments using an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The Government anticipates awarding a Cost-Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) completion type contract for Task 1; it will be issued concurrent with the contract award and will constitute the contract's guaranteed minimum order requirement. The anticipated ordering period for individual award(s) resulting from this BAA is up to 48 months in duration with individual task order period of performance ranging from 18 - 48 months.</p>
<p>PROPOSAL DUE DATE AND TIME: This BAA will remain open for a period of 35 days from the date of publication. The due date for proposals submitted in response to this BAA is no later than 12:00 p.m. MST on 19 JANUARY 2009. Proposals received after the due date and time shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3).</p>
<p>ESTIMATED PROGRAM COST: Anticipated funding for this BAA (not per contract or award) is: FY09-$1.5M; FY10-$1.5M; FY11-$1.4M; FY12-$1.0M. This funding profile is an estimate only and will not be a contractual obligation for funding. All funding is subject to change due to government discretion and availability. All potential offerors should be aware that due to unforeseen budget fluctuations, funding in any or all areas may change with little or no notice.</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION: The applicable NAICS code for this announcement is 541712 with a size standard of 500. This acquisition is unrestricted and is issued under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation paragraph 6.102(d)(2) that provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to this BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition In Contracting Act of 1984. There will be no other announcement issued for this requirement. Offerors MUST monitor FedBizOps/EPS http://www.fbo.gov and/or Grants.gov/FIND http://www.grants.gov in the event this announcement is amended. Due to past problems with posting notices to Grants.gov/FIND, offerors are advised to monitor both websites to ensure timely receipt of notifications.</p>
<p>TYPE OF CONTRACTS/INSTRUMENTS: The Air Force reserves the right to award the instrument best suited to the nature of research proposed. Accordingly, the Government may award any appropriate contract type under the Federal Acquisition Regulation or Other Transaction (OT) for Prototype, grant, cooperative agreement, or OT for Research. The Air Force may also consider award of an appropriate technology transfer mechanism if applicable. Specific instructions for assistance awards are in paragraph 7 of this BAA. It is anticipated that award under this BAA will be a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF)/Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) completion contract which requires successful offerors to have an accounting system considered adequate for tracking costs applicable to the contract.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED NUMBER OF AWARDS: The Air Force anticipates awarding multiple contracts or assistance instruments. However, the Air Force does reserve the right to make one award or no awards pursuant to this BAA.</p>

<CONTACT>Debra Buckley, Contract Specialist 805-982-3993 Peter Ly, Technical POC, 805-982-1367
<DESC>This modification is to clarify the due date for submission of abstracts and point of contact information for submission and technical questions.  The due date for submittal of abstracts is 09 FEB 2009.  The point of contact for technical questions and submission of abstracts is: PETER LY, NAVFAC ESC PW222, 1100 23RD AVENUE, PORT HUENEME, CA 93043
This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the NAVFAC Engineering Service Center (ESC) under FAR 6.102(d)(2).  This announcement is open until 01 February 2009.  NAVFAC ESC is interested in a non-mechanical fastener technology and methodology to attach thin-film photovoltaic (PV) panels to a concrete roof that is capable of withstanding Guam weather conditions, including typhoon winds of up to 200 mph.  Furthermore, the technology and methodology shall be compatible with roof coatings that are used on concrete roofs. Work under this award will be conducted in two phases. Phase I is to develop and validate the technology and methodology under controlled conditions, such as in a laboratory environment. Phase II is to field test a fully functional system in Guam. Each phase will be negotiated and awarded separately.
The announcement for this award is for abstracts only and shall be no more than five (5) pages of technical material. The abstracts shall outline the topics of interest. The abstract may be supplemented by resumes and list of publications relevant to this announcement which will not count against the five (5) page limit. The award will be made for Phase I only and is estimated for up to $450K. Abstract emphasis should be on the Phase I effort with the subsequent phase identified more broadly. Multiple awards may be made under this announcement. Topics of interest described below are provided as guides to areas that may be included in the abstract for the various phases. It is not expected that any individual abstract will include all topics, nor is it expected that abstracts limit their approach to only the areas specified in the topic list. Individual topics of interest are as follows: (a) Identify a technology and methodology for attaching PV panels to a concrete roof. Imp! act(s) to the cost of installation should be considered. (b) Thin-film PV panels generally have a product warranty of at least 20 years. The technology and methodology for attaching them to the roof should also be capable of having a similar warranty and/or be capable of maintained such that it endures for 20 years. (c) Areas of the roof not protected by the PV panels may need to be reapplied. Protecting the proposed technology, methodology, and PV system from damage during re-coating of the roof should be considered. (d) Maintenance on PV systems are relatively minimal. However, some PV panels can still fail. Ease of disengaging and reapplying the proposed technology and methodology may reduce the system's life cycle costs. (e) Testing standards, such as IEC 61646 and IEEE 1262, are commonly used to test PV modules. Any proposed technology and methodology should be capable of passing these types of tests.
A NAVFAC ESC technical review board will evaluate the abstracts to this BAA. The abstracts will be evaluated based on the following CRITERIA (listed in descending order of importance): (1) the scientific/technical merits and objectives of the abstract; (2) the contractor's capabilities, related experience, techniques, or unique combination of these that are integral factors in achieving the contractor's proposed objectives; (3) the qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the principal investigator, team leader, or key personnel who are critical in achieving the objectives of the abstract; (4) the cost relative to the proposed scientific/technical approach, and (5) the applicability of the conclusions to guidance and criteria. Subsequent to review, the NAVFAC ESC Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) may request a full scale Proposal of no more than 25 pages. NAVFAC ESC may share the abstracts and the proposals with other Dept. of Defense (DOD) personnel of offices associa! ted with this topic. Information that is sensitive or proprietary must so be marked page by page in the abstract and or proposal. Multiple awards may be made. The request for a proposal does not obligate the government in awarding a contract. CRITICAL NOTE: A CONTRACTOR IS REQUIRED TO REGISTER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (CCR). NO CONTRACT AWARD WILL BE MADE TO ANY CONTRACTOR THAT IS NOT REGISTERED OR IN THE PROCESS OF REGISTERING WITH THE DOD CCR. THE DOD CCR MAY BE REACHED AT (888) 227-2423, OR WEBSITE WWW.CCR.GOV. THERE IS NO COMMITMENT BY THE NAVY EITHER TO MAKE ANY CONTRACT AWARDS OR TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY MONEY EXPENDED BY THE CONTRACTOR BEFORE A CONTRACT AWARD. ONLY A WARRANTED CONTRACTING OFFICER CAN OBLIGATE THE GOVERNMENT. Any information that may be sensitive to review by such personnel should not be submitted. Eligibility notification will be sent to all contractors, who have submitted an abstract, after the Navy's TEB has r! eviewed all abstracts submitted by an internal periodic cut-off date. The internal periodic cut-off date may occur several times within the period from the BAA announcement to the closing date for receipt of abstracts. Abstracts may be submitted at any time, but to ensure review by the TEB, abstracts should be received by 09 February 2009. Abstracts received after this date may or may not be evaluated by the TEB and will be dependent upon the results of the evaluations and budgetary constraints. For technical questions regarding this BAA, contact Peter Ly by telephone at (805) 982-1367 or via e-mail at peter.ly@navy.mil. Abstract submittals to this BAA should be submitted on a single CD-ROM, in MS Word .doc format, or Adobe .pdf format along with 3 printed hard copies. Packages shall be mailed via USPS, UPS, or FedEx to:  PETER LY, NAVFAC ESC PW222, 1100 23RD AVENUE, PORT HUENEME, CA 93043
