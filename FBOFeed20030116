<CONTACT>Amy Dahlke Procurement Tech 7022938779     adahlke@lc.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation has a requirement for the removal and replacement of sixty-one (61) caster assemblies.  The caster assemblies support turntable structures located in the Visitor Center Theater.  The assemblies consist of two rings of fixed casters, 40 casters on the outer ring and 21 casters on the inner ring, which support a turntable structure mounted on inverted 80-pound ASCE rails.   The turntable has an unverified total weight of about 922,000 pounds including a design live load of 60 pounds per square foot (psf), and carries a maximum of 450 persons total in three separate theaters.  At least 13 of the 61 original casters have failed; 10 have been replaced with casters of a revised design.  Metallurgical evaluations of the failed casters and finite-element stress analyses of the original caster design and the first-revised caster design indicate that all 61 of the existing caster assemblies must be replaced with new caster assemblies of a new design.  Accordingly, the work to be performed includes the following:  (1) Fabricate 65 new caster assemblies (61 to replace existing and 4 spares), in accordance with the new caster assembly designs furnished by the Government; (2) Design and engineer suitable procedures for the removal of the 61 existing caster assemblies and for the installation of the 61 new caster assemblies, without damaging the existing turntable structure and equipment or the building structure; (3) Remove and dispose of the 61 existing caster assemblies; (4) Design, engineer and fabricate suitable jacking fixtures and equipment to be utilized in the replacement of the 61 caster assemblies; (5)   Install the 61 new caster assemblies under the existing turntable, in the 3-foot-deep turntable pit, where vertical clearances for access to the work may be as little as 1 foot in some areas; and (6) Align, adjust and test the 61 new caster assemblies under turntable load and motion. The work is located at the theater level of the Hoover Dam Visitor Center, adjacent to the Nevada abutment of Hoover Dam, on the Colorado River, approximately 7 miles northeast of Boulder City, Nevada, and 32 miles southeast of Las Vegas, Nevada, in Clark County Nevada. It is strongly recommended that all prospective offerors attend the pre-proposal site visit.  The site visit is tentatively scheduled for February 12, 2003 at 9:00 am PST.  The site visit will begin at the Hoover Dam Visitor Center.  Additional details on the site visit will be included in the solicitation.   This solicitation is unrestricted.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 236220 Commercial & Institutional Building (Theater Construction).

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office of Diversity intends to procure on a non-competitive basis with the National Training Lab (NTL) Institute for Applied Behavioral Science to facilitate Survey Feedback Action (SFA) workgroup meetings for NOAA executives and managers. The objective of SFA workgroup meetings is to identify and address understanding differences issues, behaviors, systems, policies and practices that are not inclusive and to work on ways to improve them. NTL trainers are familiar with NOAA's organizational culture and have experience in working with NOAA leaders, as they conducted leadership training for NOAA executives and managers during the NOAA Diversity Network conference, and have conducted SFA Facilitator training for NOAA's in-house cadre of  SFA Facilitators. NTL trainers are uniquely qualified to facilitate SFA meetings because they understand the value that differences can bring to an organization's internal workings, and have studied and shared these practices in their approach to individual, group, and organization change. NTL trainers are eminent practitioners and prominent experts in the areas of diversity, group theory, organizational development, personal growth and social change. NTL's Human Interaction labs are the most popular, the most replicated, and the most effective programs offered for changing human attitudes and behaviors. Their new applications of experiential learning have emerged to represent the most current and cutting edge programs in the fields of change management, human resources, organizational development, training, and diversity. NTL's renowned Journal of Applied Behavioral Science contributes a body of knowledge to the field that increases understanding of change processes and outcomes; and the publication continues to grow in reputation and prestige around the world. While other trainers have been considered,  NTL is the only company with substantial technical expertise and experience to identify, understand and address issues of diversity tension, diversity conflict, attitudes and behaviors which surface during SFA meetings.  Any source that believes it can supply the required service should respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet the above requirement, within 45 days of this notice, to the above address. The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bonafide capability to meet the requirements.  See note 22.

Work includes integration of various disciplines such as survey/location capabilities, geophysical detection and discrimination, systems integration, geographical information systems data management, his torical data analysis, footprint reduction methodologies, field reconnaissance, engineering evaluations, geophysical mapping, anomaly discrimination, cost analysis, risk analysis, statistical sampling and analysis, and sampling, removal, and treatment of O E.  Work also requires successful support and execution of other elements of the OE program at the Former Fort Ord including, but not limited to, the OE Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (OE RI/FS) and site specific Fort Ord requirements emanating f rom the Fort Ord endangered species Habitat Management Plan (HMP), treatment and demolition of OE items, and land transfer requirements as a result of convenant deferral requests. The proposed contract action is for an increase in contract capacity of $9 m illion due to the current contract reaching its full, negotiated capacity less than three years into an anticipated five-year contract period.

The period of performance for Contract No. DACA05-00- D-0003, will remain the same, with a contract completion date of 13 July 2005.  All interested parties may respond or submit statements of qualifications.  This is not a request for competitive proposals or quotations.

This data involves the design of military derivatives of Boeing?s Model 707, 727, 737, and 747 commercial aircraft.  It comes in the forms of drawings, CD-ROMs, Mylars, Digital Electronic Media and other formats.  The Government needs access to this proprietary data in order to obtain competition from contractors to make replenishment spare parts for the Government?s military derivatives of the above stated Boeing commercial aircraft.  In order to obtain this data from Boeing, a contract is required, setting out the terms and conditions under which Boeing will agree to the Government?s use of this data for competitive procurement of replenishment spare parts for the above stated aircraft.

All responsible and responsive offers will be considered.  The proposed issue date for the solicitation is 6 Feb 03.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR part 12.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to negotiate with and issue a sole source modification to Dewolff, Boberg, and Associates (DBA), 100 North Central Expressway, Suite 210, Richardson, Texas 75080, for additional consulting services, as part of a previously awarded Command-wide Efficiency Management and Productivity Improvement Consulting Services contract.  The resultant modification will add an additional 65 manweeks of effort.  DBA has already begun the Command-wide study and as such holds significant knowledge of NAVSEA and affiliated Program Executive Office (PEO) procedures, contracts, policies, and organization.  The scope of work requires that the contractor evaluate NAVSEA processes, program management functions and duties, and government and contractor manpower needs.  As such, it is a requirement that the contractor be free from all potential conflict of in terests, cannot be currently performing any other NAVSEA contract, and will be prevented from being awarded any future NAVSEA business.  DBA is in a unique position of never having held a NAVSEA contract, other than the current Command-wide Efficiency Management and Productivity Improvement Consulting Services contract and is excluded from performing any other type of future work for NAVSEA.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, on behalf of the Program Manager for Ammunition, Marine Corps Systems Command and USSOCOM desire the acquisition and qualification of non-development improvements to the existing 40mm M430 High Explosive, Dual Purpose (HEDP) cartridge.  Improvements must include a propulsion system that eliminates the base plug design of the current cartridge and incorporation of a programmable variable time (VT) fuze that allows the cartridge to function and fire from both the General Dynamic Armament Systems MK47 and the MK19 Grenade Machine Gun (GMG).   The acquisition of two HEDP versions (point detonating and programmable) under one contract (allowing for the use of common components and one line of production tooling) is contemplated so that USSOCOM and the USMC can maximize common sub-components and reduce the overall costs of qualifying  and procuring improved ammunition.  It is desired that the contractor: (1) Have a non-developmental 40mm (High Velocity) Propulsion system design that demonstrates reduced dispersion and improved lot to lot muzzle velocity variations (when compared to the M430) with production ammunition in hot, cold and ambient conditions when fired from the MK19 and MK47; (2) Have existing production tooling/line capable of producing LRIP quantities of improved M430 cartridges.  The contractor should have an existing high rate production for improved M430 40mm Propulsion system; (3) Have a programmable fuze that will function with General Dynamic Armament System's  MK47/ALGL; (4) Have the technical expertise and facilities to: (a) Integrate incendiary technology into existing HEDP warheads; (b) Conduct standard NATO/IM safety tests prior to delivery of qualification samples.  It is also des ired that Improved Shelf Life and dud reducing performance features are included in the PIP.  If not located in CONUS, the Contractor must be willing to move Load, Assembly and Pack (LAP) of the improved 40mm point detonating cartridge to the United States and provide a summary plan for US based production, to fulfill potential section 806 restrictions.  Interested Parties should reply by submitting a White Paper no later than 14 March 2003 to Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Attn: Code XDS105, Building 183, Room 133, 17320 Dahlgren Road, Dahlgren, VA 22448-5100.  Questions may be submitted in writing to the above address, or email vaughangr@nswc.navy.mil.  Interested Parties who are willing to provide Qualification Rounds at no cost for USMC/USSOCOM testing should so indicate in the submitted white paper.  No further information is available from the Procuring  Office.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS OF REQUIREMENT FOR ENGINEERING SERVICES IN SUPPORT OF THE INTEGRATION OF  AIRBORNE MINE COUNTERMEASURES SYSTEMS WITH VARIOUS COMMAND, CONTROL, COMMUNICATIONS, COMPUTERS, INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, AND RECONNAISSANCE (C4ISR) SYSTEMS The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station, Panama City, Florida (NSWCDDCSS), intends to award a sole-source Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract to Northrop Grumman Corporation, Melbourne FL for engineering services in support of the integration of airborne mine countermeasures systems currently under development with existing or potential future C4ISR systems for the purposes of developing real-time or near real-time data transfer and post mission effectiveness analyses.  The Airborne Mine Defense Program Office (PMS-210) is managing multiple Organic Airborne Mine Counter Measur es (OAMCM) sensors for the next generation of mine warfare systems.  Northrop Grumman is the prime contractor for Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS), Rapid Airborne Mine Clearance System (RAMICS), and Coastal Battlefield Reconnaissance and Analysis (COBRA), three of these programs.  ALMDS is also the lead program to set the standards and common C4I, Tactics, Mission Planning, and Post Mission Analysis (CTMP) architecture for Initial Operating Capability (IOC) planned for CY05.  In this context the IDIQ contract with Northrop Grumman is being established for C4I, Tactics, Mission Planning, and Post Mission Analysis (CTMP).  This effort will establish the overall framework for all OAMCM systems to fit under as a common approach to Operational Integration and Fleet Delivery.   NSWCDDCSS is the contracting agent for ALMDS and will serve in this capacity for the CTMP commo n OAMCM tasking. The purpose of this effort is to ensure the integration and interoperability of the ALMDS, the RAMICS and the COBRA system.  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. Northrop Grumman Corporation is the sole designer and developer of the ALMDS, RAMICS, and COBRA systems. The required detailed knowledge of these system designs and the ability to determine the C4ISR integration requirements for these systems is solely resident at Northrop Grumman. Therefore Northrop Grumman is the only source possessing the expertise, technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to perform the required engineering studies and interface requirement definition analysis required for the integration of the AMCM suite of sensors and existing and potential fleet C4ISR systems. Thus, this acquisition is for continued provis ion of highly specialized services within the meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii).

The contractor would be required to provide a hard copy report containing alternatives, recommendations and a strategic plan for implementation and make an oral presentation of plan to SRG/CBC key players.  Background information:  On 09 August 2002 the First Naval Construction Division (1NCD) was established at Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek, VA. The new alignment revamped a decade-old structure in which Atlantic Fleet Seabees reported to the Second Naval Construction Brigade in Norfolk, while Pacific Seabees fell under Third Naval Construction Brigade, Pearl Harbor. Those two brigades were decommissioned and replaced by the new organization.  The mission of 1NCD is to organize, train, operate and maintain the Naval Construction Force; to command and control Naval Construction Regiments; and to develop, coordinate and implement policy and requirements to man, equip and train Seabees.  An integral part of the traditional organization has been the two active training regiments, the 20th NCR in Gulfport and 30th NCR in Pearl Harbor.  As a result of this fundamental change in structure, the two training regiments have taken on a new focus as the 20th Seabee Readiness Group Atlantic (SRGLANT) and 31st Seabee Readiness Group Pacific (SRGPAC). The commanding officers of the Naval Construction Battalion Centers (CBC) in Gulfport and Port Hueneme, Calif., serve additional duty as commanders of the respective Seabee Readiness Groups. Under the new organization, SRGLANT, and by association CBC Gulfport, have been tasked with assuming the leadership role for logistics while SRGPAC and CBC Port Hueneme have been assigned the leadership role for training.

The contracted party will perform preliminary investigation and research into the required actions necessary for SRGLANT and CBC Gulfport to aggressively assume the leadership role in the area of logistics.  The contracted party will develop a strategic vision for SRGLANT role as Lead readiness group for Logistics.  2.  A significant portion of Naval Construction Force logistics involves the management of Table of Allowances (TOA). The contracted party will develop strategic recommendations for the SRGLANT R-43 organization for TOA management.  These recommendations should cover both types of TOA, final title and Pre-positioned War Reserve Material Stock (PWRMS). Any offerors must possess the following qualifications.  The contracted party must have (1) Knowledge of Naval Construction Force operations, training, and logistic support requirements.  (2) An understanding of the new 1NCD organization structure and how the two SRGs conceptually fit into that organization. (3) A well developed comprehension of the facilities, systems and capabilities of both CBC Gulfport, CBC Port Hueneme, Seabee Readiness Groups, Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NCF SYSCOM role) and the Naval Supply System.  (4) Contracted party must possess the ability to analyze the current visions of the NCF logistics improvements (logistics improvement roadmap) and past initiatives to get to the present concept of operations.

The solicitation document and its incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-11.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to procure on a sole source basis using Simplified Acquisition procedures with Boston Biosciences Inc. To continue this on-going research, 550 custom made peptides with amino acid sequences will cover the genes of HIV-1 Env, Gag, Pol and Nef from different clades.  These custom-synthesized 15-amino acids peptides with 11 amino acids overlapping each other will be made in 25mg scale with over 75% purity by HPLC.  The purpose of this requirement is to develop vaccine for HIV, Ebola and potentially, other viral diseases.  Making different mutations of viral proteins is critical in the vaccine development.  After making different mutations of viral protein, those vaccine candidates will be evaluated for their immunogenicities against the viral proteins.  Having various reliable and accurate assays to measure the B cell and T cell response in animals after immunization is an essential part of this process.  Synthesized peptides have been used to develop different immune assays to measure the different immune responses.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Deseases have used these custom peptides for years.  It is imperative that the same consistent high quality specific custom peptides synthesis.  Such consistency is essential for analysis data between different experiments at different times, and  this intrinsic consistency cannot be replaced easily by other companies products.  Therefore, we must maintain continuity of  reagents to insure experimental results are not influenced by new variables and to avoid delays in testing products from other suppliers, changing vendors now would compromise results.

<SUBJECT>A--EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE RESEARCH USING DATA AND PRODUCTS FROM TERRA, AQUA, AND ACRIM SATELLITES
<SOLNBR>NRA-03-OES-02
<RESPDATE>041503
<ARCHDATE>01162004
<CONTACT>Dr. James C. Dodge, EOS Coordinator, Phone (202) 358-0763, Fax (202) 358-2770, Email jdodge@hq.nasa.gov
<DESC>This NASA Research Announcement (NRA) provides an opportunity for scientists to undertake significant studies concerning some of the Earth Science Enterprise's key research questions through the use of data and derived products from three of the Earth Observing System (EOS) series of satellites, namely Terra, ACRIMSAT, and Aqua, and their measurement sensors. It represents both a continuation of the research aspects of the EOS Instrument Teams from these satellites and new opportunities for other scientists to conduct research projects using the new data and products resulting from these satellites. This NRA solicits two types of proposals: 1.)	 "EOS Algorithm Refinement Proposals" will be accepted from prospective new or continuing science team members who wish to refine and maintain the derived product quality for any of the currently-approved Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) algorithms. The scientific justification for such improvements must be compelling and should be the focus of the proposed investigations. Current team members from foreign countries need not reapply and do not need to submit proposals to this NRA.  2.)	"Science Data Analysis and Modeling Research Proposals" will be accepted from any proposer with innovative approaches to making scientific use of the data or products from the research sensors on Terra, Aqua, and ACRIMSAT.   These data and/or products can be used individually, in combination with that from other sensors, or in conjunction the appropriate data from other sources and satellites. Proposers selected under this category may also request to become members of one or more science teams. This NRA is open to all scientific investigators who submit proposals that respond to the key science questions of the Earth Science Enterprise Research Program ( http://www.earth.nasa.gov/visions/researchstrat/Research_Strategy.htm  ), and meet the other requirements stated in this announcement. Awards will be made for a period of up to three years for approved projects. Participation in the program is open to all categories of domestic and foreign organizations, including educational institutions, industry, non-profit institutions, NASA centers and other U.S. Government agencies. In accordance with NASA policy as described in Appendix B, all investigations by foreign proposers will be conducted on a no-exchange-of-funds basis, i.e., investigators whose home institution is outside the United States cannot be funded by NASA. Current foreign EOS Science Team Members may continue their participation and need not propose again. The total budget available for EOS science team leaders and members to conduct Algorithm Maintenance and Data Analysis and Modeling will be approximately $63M/yr for the next three years.  NASA is trying to achieve a balanced program of activity that is keyed to the post-launch status of the flight program missions. As time goes on, less emphasis will be placed upon algorithm refinement and more will be placed on the analysis of EOS data and the modeling of results. The support for algorithm development is currently planned to decrease from about $33M to $24M over the next three years, with a corresponding increase in the amount devoted towards scientific data analysis and modeling efforts. Team member proposals should be in the general range of $150K-300K/yr. The overall program balance will be determined by the selecting official.  Both the number of team members and the sizes of the resulting grants and contracts from this solicitation will be determined by the selecting official to achieve an optimal blend of continuing algorithm refinement and necessary continuing calibration and validation activities while moving aggressively to achieve the maximum exploitation of the new EOS data for answering the key questions of the ESE Research Plan. The complete NRA will be available electronically on January 30, 2003, via the Internet at the Research Opportunities Web Page at  http://research.hq.nasa.gov  under "Office of Earth Science (Code Y)". A paper copy will be available to those who do not have access to Internet by calling (202) 358-3552 and leaving a voice mail message. This announcement will be open through April 15, 2003, and proposals may be submitted at any time throughout this period. Notice of Intent will be due February 28, 2003.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620    The EPA intends to award a sole source purchase order to Dr. Jesse Ford at Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR.  97331-2147. Dr. Ford will be tasked with reviewing the fourth draft Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) heavy metals assessment;  organizing peer review comments for incorporation into the final document; organizing figures, tables and data annexes for delivery to AMAP and providing editorial and logistical support to enable final delivery of the edited report.  Dr. Ford is uniquely qualified to provide these services.  She has been  active in the field of airborne Arctic contaminants (heavy metals and organochlorines) since 1990.  She contributed data to heavy metals chapter for AMAP Phase 1 and new data on persistent organic pollutants for Phase II.  In 1999, Dr. Ford served as rapporteur for the EPA sponsored "Heavy Metals  in the Arctic" international meeting in Anchorage, AK which formed the foundation for the AMAP Phase II international research plan.  Her research results released in July 2001 on heavy metals enrichment from the Red Dog Mine haul road in Alaska for the U.S. National Park Service was of exceptional  quality and has triggered significant governmental investigation.  She is up to date on heavy metal research and has substantial experience in parterning on complex tasks with scientific teams.  These factors make Dr. Ford capable of providing the expertise required by EPA to fulfill its  obligations as lead agency in support of heavy metals under AMAP.

<DESC>This Synopsis Is Being Issued To Update Potential Offerors On The Status For The Upcoming Procurement Of An Aircraft Integrated Maintenance System (Aims) To Be Installed In The Ch-46 Helicopter.  PROPOSALS ARE NOT REQUESTED AT THIS TIME AND WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED UNTIL AFTER THE SOLICITATION IS RELEASED.  The draft solicitation is expected to be released on or around January 24, 2003 and may be accessed at http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/.  The closing date for comments to the DRAFT RFP will be 5 February 2003.  The release date for the final solicitation will be published in a subsequent synopsis. 

The U.S. Marine Corps has a requirement for an Aircraft Integrated Maintenance System (AIMS) and related supplies and services for the CH-46E aircraft. The primary components of AIMS will be desktop software application, onboard Processor Unit, a Display Unit, Optical Rotor Tracker, Vibration Sensors, cable assemblies and miscellaneous aircraft installation components. AIMS will be the consolidation and integration of existing support equipment functions including rotor track and balance (Chadwick-Helmuth P0372/8500C), vibration monitoring and analysis (Chadwick-Helmuth 14235), engine data acquisition and analysis (Howell H337NP600A).
AIMS, when installed in the CH-46E aircraft, will provide for integrated rotor track and balance capability, continuous monitoring of vibration levels of all dynamic components and engine performance parameters. AIMS will also provide for future implementation of aircrew in-flight warnings for basic vibration exceedances and engine parameter exceedances. AIMS data will be downloaded to a desktop software application for additional data analysis, trending and storage. AIMS will be user configurable to the extent required for vibration alarming and initializing aircraft configurations. The benefits of an onboard monitoring system include the preservation of aircraft structure and electronic components life, tremendous reductions in maintenance man-hours due to enhanced trouble shooting /fault isolation and the elimination of ground support equipment requirements. The requirement includes the aircraft kits, ancillary hardware, and engineering services necessary to upgrade CH-46E aircraft.

The proposed contract will include basic line items for the non-recurring engineering required to manufacture two (2) each AIMS prototype kits, including all software and peculiar support equipment; two (2) each AIMS Engineering Simulation Systems including all software; and two (2) each AIMS Validation/Verification kits including all software and peculiar support equipment.  Repair, training, and technical support services and associated hardware/software shall also be provided as part of the basic requirement.   Upon satisfactory completion of first article testing, options may be exercised for up to 215 each AIMS production kits; spare and repair parts; 72 each ancillary equipment and associated software; User/Engineering Ground Software; 2 each Maintenance Trainer units; and repair, training, and technical support services for the preceding items.   Hardware deliveries are required as follows:  Prototype kits ? 8 months after contract award (ACA); Engineering Simulation Systems ? First unit: 8 months ACA/Second unit:  16 months ACA; VAL/VER kits ? 14 months ACA; Production kits and Interim Spares ? 6 months after production (option 1) contract award.  Upon final release of the RFP, proposals will be evaluated based upon each offeror?s Technical Approach, Past Performance and Price.  Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The synopsis is amended to restate the description of the effort as follows: The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) is responsible for the investigation of novel biological technologies that provided significant improvement in current Navy systems or represent new technologies and materials to be developed. One area of research has utilized the ability of certain classes of biological molecules to self organize and to fabricate molecular systems of interest to the Navy in primarily but not exclusively, non medical applications. The application of this technology includes: 1) the development of novel materials and processing methods, 2) the fabrication of a variety of chemical sensors (also new chemical and biological diagnostic techniques), 3) process improvement in microelectronic and hybrid devices, 4) the processing of blood surrogates, and 5) the prevention of biofouling in critical Naval structures.

The NRL has a broad mission that requires the expertise of a qualified contractor to carry out research and development in the diverse area of Bio/Molecular Science and Engineering. The work requires expertise in Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Engineering and Administrative Services. The Center is responsible for the synthesis, development, and application of state   of   the  art bio/molecular and self assembly technologies for Naval applications including processing methods, chemical sensors, hybrid biomaterials, bio/molecular devices, diagnostic techniques and methodologies in non medical research and anti corrosion and anti fouling treatments.

NRL has a requirement for a contractor to conduct research and development activities on site at the Naval Research Laboratory. The principle objectives of this research effort are to: 1) fabricate and design optical and electrode base biosensors, 2) research membrane biophysical chemistry and self assembly of microstructures for advanced materials, 3) study methods of dry state preservation of blood cellar components to include in vitro testing and new materials and methods to accelerate the healing of soft and hard tissue injury including in vitro testing, 4) design microwave devices, ultramicroelectrodes and electron emitters on metallized composites and patterned assembly for advanced materials using liquid crystals and colloids, 5) explore selective patterning and application of biological materials ( proteins, cells) on solid substrates, 6) synthesis and characterization of liquid crystal materials, 7) investigate processes for lithography and patterning for high resolution imaging, 8) use genetic engineering to research biomaterials, 9) synthesis and development of novel materials for separation, 10) perform literature searches, organize and execute technical review programs, create graphics, etc. for publishing, 11) purification, characterization and application of biomolecular motors and their component proteins, 12) related to blood substitution, tissue repair, and deeper understanding of the relationship of the mechanisms at work in amerliorting the effects of injury to military personnel, and 13) selective monolithic periodic mesoporous organosilicas for filtration applications and application of chemical detection dosimeter for environmental toxins, 14) fabricate biological and electrochemical biosensors as well as seafloor bio fuel cells for further research as well as for technical demonstrations. Further details will be provided in the statement of work of the RFP. The Government anticipates award of a cost plus fixed fee term contract.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION: Training Transformation, mandated OSD, will require the integration of training, not only across training systems, but also as an inseparable element in DoDs new system of systems environment. As such, the Department must identify interfaces between training systems and acquisition, logistics, personnel, military education, and command and control processes, and ensure training is integrated into these processes. Interoperable net-centric training capabilities, such as embedded simulations, job-performance aids, and integrated simulators and training devices, will be elevated as priorities within the acquisition process. Acquisition processes will be modified to include training requirements as a key performance parameter or a similar forcing function construct to ensure cost-benefit trade offs inherent to the design of new military systems and equipment explicitly considering interoperable, net-centric training systems and testing. Training will be tracked in a manner similar to that of key performance parameters throughout the acquisition process. REQUIREMENT: NAVAIRSYSCOM has a requirement for development and revision of guiding documents and training support in their use to inform DoD training system acquisition managers and developers in the improvement of acquisition process and training system effectiveness to meet the strategic OSD goal cited above. NAVAIR Orlando anticipates awarding an indefinite quantity/delivery type contract to the selected firm/team. A single source will be selected to ensure seamless integration of best practices across the MIL-PRF/HDBK-29612 volumes. The Government anticipates a Not-to-Exceed $5M contract over a 60-month period. Detailed requirements for specific tasks will be issued as firm-fixed price/cost plus fixed fee delivery orders for a task or combination of tasks under the contract. PRODUCTS AND SERVICES: The products will include analysis of education and training technology and processes, incorporation of human systems integration factors across the processes, insertion of technology, and streamlining of the Instructional Systems Development (ISD)/Systems Approach to Training (SAT) process. The effort will include the development of training system acquisition and development guidance products that include DoD training Military Standards, Specifications, and Handbooks, electronic performance support systems, and other aids for training managers and developers. This effort will also include market research of best ISD business practices related to the ISD/SAT, interactive multimedia instruction, advanced distributed learning, distributed mission training, and trainer acquisition processes. It will include independent verification and validation of computer-based training and education courses and products, analysis of industry training processes and potential application for DoD training and education. It will also include guidance for identification of required human performance measures and opportunities for embedded training early in the acquisition process.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION: Training Transformation, mandated OSD, will require the integration of training, not only across training systems, but also as an inseparable element in DoDs new system of systems environment. As such, the Department must identify interfaces between training systems and acquisition, logistics, personnel, military education, and command and control processes, and ensure training is integrated into these processes. Interoperable net-centric training capabilities, such as embedded simulations, job-performance aids, and integrated simulators and training devices, will be elevated as priorities within the acquisition process. Acquisition processes will be modified to include training requirements as a key performance parameter or a similar forcing function construct to ensure cost-benefit trade offs inherent to the design of new military systems and equipment explicitly considering interoperable, net-centric training systems and testing. Training will be tracked in a manner similar to that of key performance parameters throughout the acquisition process. REQUIREMENT: NAVAIRSYSCOM has a requirement for development and revision of guiding documents and training support in their use to inform DoD training system acquisition managers and developers in the improvement of acquisition process and training system effectiveness to meet the strategic OSD goal cited above. NAVAIR Orlando anticipates awarding an indefinite quantity/delivery type contract to the selected firm/team. A single source will be selected to ensure seamless integration of best practices across the MIL-PRF/HDBK-29612 volumes. The Government anticipates a Not-to-Exceed $5M contract over a 60-month period. Detailed requirements for specific tasks will be issued as firm-fixed price/cost plus fixed fee delivery orders for a task or combination of tasks under the contract. PRODUCTS AND SERVICES: The products will include analysis of education and training technology and processes, incorporation of human systems integration factors across the processes, insertion of technology, and streamlining of the Instructional Systems Development (ISD)/Systems Approach to Training (SAT) process. The effort will include the development of training system acquisition and development guidance products that include DoD training Military Standards, Specifications, and Handbooks, electronic performance support systems, and other aids for training managers and developers. This effort will also include market research of best ISD business practices related to the ISD/SAT, interactive multimedia instruction, advanced distributed learning, distributed mission training, and trainer acquisition processes. It will include independent verification and validation of computer-based training and education courses and products, analysis of industry training processes and potential application for DoD training and education. It will also include guidance for identification of required human performance measures and opportunities for embedded training early in the acquisition process. CAPABILITIES: The joint services ISD/SAT and training acquisition policies emerged out of long-term debates within the Defense Training System Working Group (DTSWG) to arrive at consensus on best practices. Accordingly, participation with the DTSWG in that deliberative process will be a weighting factor in source selection.  Consideration will also be given for experience in the authoring and revision of the current guiding documents. Successful performance of this contract will require extensive knowledge of and experience with MIL-PRF-29612, MIL-HDBK-29612, related DIDs, MIL-PRF-XXXX and MIL-HDBK-XXXX for trainers.

It is anticipated that the Proteomics sites will deposit their reagents/products to a centralized repository such as the Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases Research Resource, a new program that will be supported by a separate NIAID contract for distribution to the broader research community; 3) In conjunction with the Project Officer, establish a Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) composed of leading scientists knowledgeable in a broad range of proteomics and bioinformatic research areas.  The committee members shall also include individuals with expertise in microbiology, immunology (both innate and adaptive immunity), and infectious diseases.  The committee shall provide advice to the NIAID on the operations and future directions of the Proteomics Centers program based on the state of proteomic technological and research advances, including those contributed by the Proteomics Centers; and 4) Organize programmatic meetings and other related activities involving all of the Proteomics Research Program sites.  It is anticipated that one (1) cost-reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded, with a period of five (5) years, beginning approximately September 2003.  RFP NIH-NIAID-DMID-03-45 will be available electronically on or about December 13, 2002, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Branch (CMB) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract.  Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>NASA/JSC is hereby soliciting information for potential sources for delivery of a new Space Shuttle auxiliary recorder system and associated documentation.	The vendor will be responsible for designing, testing, and producing flight and ground support hardware. The current system uses a Shuttle unique controller to run a 1960 designed magnetic tape recorder.  Numerous obsolescence issues exist with the current system with the most pressing being the ability to buy, store and qualify magnetic tape.  NASA intends to upgrade the current system with a modern design that will enhance the current system's capabilities while using less power, less cooling, taking up less space, and requiring less maintenance.	   The new system will be controlled via the existing discrete command interface and will provide real-time analog and discrete status.  The new system will be required to record digital and analog inputs, store the inputs, and play back the stored data in its original form.  The new system, which is located in the crew cabin, will run for a total of two hours during a mission.  Runtime can be broken down into 15 minutes prelaunch, 45 minutes during ascent, and the final ninety minutes during entry.    Post landing the data is played back to a ground data reduction facility.  This data is then distributed to the engineering community for review.  Data storage requirements are estimated to be in the 80-gigabyte range.  Data integrity is a must and the stored data cannot be corrupted by on-orbit radiation.     No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these cites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Responses must include the following:  name and address of firm,  size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, and/or woman-owned; number of years in business; affiliate information:  parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phone number).	Technical questions should be directed to:  Ken Dwyer. Procurement related questions should be directed to: Julie Karr. The requirement is not considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product as defined in Internet "Note A".   This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.   The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.  All responses shall be submitted	to Julie Karr no later than Febuary 17, 2003.  In responding reference BV-01-15-03.  Any referenced notes can be viewed at the following URL:	  http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasanote.html

<DESC>Description: 69 Training Aids and Devices 

The Marine Corps Systems Command, Program Manager for Training Systems (PM TRASYS), intends to upgrade the United States Marine Corps Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement-Training System (MTVR-TS) electronic classrooms (EC) courseware.  The Marine Corps recently procured EC and electronic courseware to train MTVR operator and maintenance personnel.  Camp Johnson, NC and Fort Leonard Wood, MO consists of seven 40-seat and two 60-seat EC respectively.  The objective of the MTVR-TS EC upgrade is to deliver commercial and non-developmental items (CaNDI) courseware application software that provides the same user interfaces and course content as the existing courseware.  The government has approximately $500,000 available for the effort at this time.  

The government considers the following capabilities necessary for successful performance of this effort:

?	Demonstrated successful management of programs that 
        develop, modify, and deliver EC based courseware.  

?	Demonstrated success in designing, establishing, or 
        modifying military electronic classroom environments for 
        the purpose of implementing new or modified electronic 
        courseware.  

?	Demonstrated success in the development and delivery of 
        military EC based courseware with the following 
        attributes: 1) military skills-based training courseware, 
        such as maintenance, operator, or other non-leadership, 
        non-professional, task type instruction; 2) contains both 
        instructor led and Interactive Courseware (ICW); 3) 
        duration suitable for Military Occupational Skill (MOS) 
        or skill certification course; 4) contains level IV 
        interactivity; 5) Internet ready (i.e. able to transport 
        across the internet).  

?	Demonstrated in-house core expertise of curriculum 
        developers, software developers, and courseware 
        programming engineers.

?	The offeror has sufficient existing financial stability 
        and company infrastructure to successfully complete the 
        effort.

Interested and qualified parties are invited to provide comments and questions relative to the attached draft MTVR-TS EC Statement of Objectives (SOO) no later than 07 February 2003.  The government?s intent is to release a Request for Proposal (RFP) in April 2003 and award a contract in June 2003.   The government anticipates the contract to last twelve months or less for this effort. A site visit to Camp Johnson, NC will be available to qualified parties after the RFP release.  The type of contract is still under consideration by the government at this time.

This RFI also serves as solicitation for interested parties.  All those interested in receiving an RFP must respond to this posting. 

Closing Date:  02/07/03

<DESC>NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) intends to negotiate a modification to Contract NAS5-35079, on a sole source basis, with Johnson Controls, Incorporated (JCI).  The sole source acquisition is to obtain supplies and services for modifications to the Utility Control System (UCS) at GSFC.  The modification will permit for an increase in contract performance time to permit  GSFC to prepare and transition the existing UCS from a proprietary system to an open protocol UCS.  The modification will allow for future competition of the requirement. At present, no single standard communications protocol exists which allows devices from other manufacturers to communicate transparently with the UCS at Goddard in its existing configuration.   This sole source modification is justified under 10 USC 2304 ( c )( 1 )  ONLY ONE RESPONSIBLE SOURCE because utilizing Johnson Controls equipment for the continuing replacement of the UCS is essential to achieving the Governments stated requirements. However, all responsible sources desiring consideration are requested to fully identify their interest and capabilities, in writing, not later than 4:30 p.m., local time, 15 days after the publication of this synopsis, to the Contracting Officer cited above. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open basis, based upon the responses, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See note 26.  An Ombudsman has been appointed, See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard intends to modify an existing contract, for the construction of a 21,500 SF NESU/ESU Building, to add an additional 1600 SF of building at ISC Honolulu, Hawaii.   Oceanic Companies Inc. was awarded a contract for the construction of the NESU/ESU Building in September 2002.  Additional space is needed for additional personnel.   Oceanic is currently constructing the building.  At this time, anyone other than Oceanic would result in duplication of costs to the Government that would not be recovered through soliciting competitive proposals again.  The contract requires general construction disciplines.  Estimated amount is not expected to exceed $300,000.00

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI).  This is not a solicitation for bids/proposals, but a Request for Information (RFI).  This synopsis is issued for the sole purpose of the OC-ALC/PKOSS Operational Contracting Division, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, to conduct Market Research in accordance with FAR Part 10.  This effort is to seek qualified sources capable of providing select services for the Air Force Research Laboratory.  The select services are in support of the Air Force Research Laboratory Probability of Detection Studies for Nondestructive Inspection Facilities Requirement.  Background:  The Air Force NDI Office is tasked via Air Force Instruction 21-105 to perform POD studies for the Air Force when requested by its customers.  A POD protocol was created for the POD studies.  This protocol is called  NDInsite (trademark) [Karta Technologies, Inc.,5555 Northwest Parkway, San Antonio, TX 78249, (210)-582-3551 (Government Furnished Property)].  A POD study is a statistical process that determines the current inspection capability of a facility, NDI process, or NDI equipment.  There are various kinds of studies that can be performed using the protocol.  The key to any POD study is the specimen.   Specimens are parts or simulated parts that contain flaws.  Most of the specimens are unflawed to simulate actual working conditions.  The flaws in the specimens vary in size and location depending on the kind of POD study applied.  Services are to include a variety of interrelated tasks to be performed by the contractor when instructed to do so by the Government.   There are seven major tasks associated with this requirement.  When invoked by a Delivery Order, the contactor shall perform one or more of the tasks.  An abbreviated description of tasks are as follows;  (1)  General Administration and Management of Resources:  Prepare Monthly reports of the progress on each task under contract in a format approved by the Government Quality Assurance Personnel (QAP).  (2)  Meetings:  The contractor shall make all arrangements for meetings, to include the preparation/distribution of agendas, opaque projectors for vu-graph briefings, etc, and the taking/distribution of all meeting notes/action items.  (3)  POD Study Execution Plan:  Contactor shall develop a detailed execution plan necessary to administer a POD Study at the location(s) identified in the contract Delivery Order and prepare all documentation and briefings in accordance with NDInsite (trademark).   (4)  Perform an Announced POD Study:  When invoked by a Delivery Order, the contractor shall aquire the necessary specimen sets from the QAP and shall arrange for transport to and from the location(s) determined by the Government.  Contractor shall travel to location(s) and administer the announced POD Study(ies) in accordance with the established protocol plan.  Contractor shall perform any cleaning or preparation associated with the POD Specimens.  Contractor shall use the analysis software to determine the current POD capability of the facility(ies) studied, provide a report summarizing their activities, identify any discrepancies or unusual activities, and submit the report to the QAP.  (5)  Perform an Unannounced POD Study:  When invoked by a Delivery Order, the contactor shall aquire POD specimens from the QAP and arrange for shipment(s) of POD specimens to the selected facility(ies) for testing by facility personnel.  Contractor shall perform any cleaning or preparation associated with the POD Specimens.  Contractor shall use the analysis software to determine the current POD capability of the facility(ies) studied, provide a report summarizing their activities, identify any discrepancies or unusual activities, and submit the report to the QAP.  (6)  Design and Develop Metal POD Specimens:  When invoked in a Delivery Order, contractor shall prepare specimen design drawings with coordination of the Government QAP.  When approved, the contractor shall acquire the necessary materials and manufacture the necessary flawed and unflawed specimens, which shall become the property of the Government.  Each specimen shall have a ?bumpy? bar code serial number.  Contactor shall prepare a report characterizing the flaws in each specimen as to size and location in a format approved by the QAP.  Contactor shall input this data into the specimen database established in NDInsite (trademark).   (7)  Design and Develop Non-Metallic Composite and Bonded Assembly POD Specimens (Ultrasonic):  When invoked in a Delivery Order, contractor shall prepare specimen design drawings with coordination of the Government QAP.  When approved, the contractor shall acquire the necessary materials and manufacture the necessary flawed and unflawed specimens, which shall become the property of the Government.

<DESC>This is a special notice issued by Westinghouse Savannah River Company (WSRC), management and operating contractor for the U.S. Department of Energy's Savannah River Site near Aiken, South Carolina.  WSRC wishes to determine public interest in licensing for commercial applications a new method and device that collects and concentrates airborne agents in a liquid sample for immediate onsite or subsequent laboratory analysis.  The Aerosol-to-Liquid Particle Extraction System (ALPES) is designed to collect chemical agents; radioactive particles; microorganisms such as spores, bacteria, and fungi; and molecules and other substances associated with explosives.  The collection efficiency is greater than 90 percent for particles of less then 0.3 micron diameters.  ALPES takes advantage of the long-proven use of wet electrostatic precipitation to separate particles from air.  The device comprises an ionization section atop a tubular collection electrode enclosed in a column.  A pump pulls air through the vertical column at a flow rate of 300 liters a minute.  A reservoir at the bottom of the column contains liquid that is pumped up through the inside of the collection tube, which is charged at 8,000 volts.  The liquid flows over the top of the charged tube and down the sides, collecting the ionized particles from the outside surface of the tube.  Constant recirculation of the liquid through the tube concentrates the collected particles.  With minimal pressure drop, the device consumes less then 12 watts of power and operates quietly.  ALPES can be wall-mounted for inconspicuous operations in facilities such as hospitals, post offices, convention centers, and stadiums.  For more information on the patent-pending ALPES device, contact Joseph P. Dugan via telephone at (803) 725-0848; via fax at (803) 725-4988; via email at joseph.dugan@srs.gov; or via regular mail at Westinghouse Savannah River Company, Building 773-41A, Room #243, Aiken, SC  29808.  Responses to this notice should be received by February 18, 2003.  This is not a request for a formal subcontract; it is a request for interested parties and licensing opportunities only.

<SUBJECT>39 -- FPI
<DESC>Under the provisions of FPI's guidelines process, published March 12, 1997, in the Federal Register and March 25, 1997, in the Commerce Business Daily, FPI submits the following "good faith" announcement for public notice and comment.  FPI proposes to manufacture containers for sale competitively to the United States Postal Service (USPS), without mandatory source.

Under FPI's guidelines covering the production of new products and significant expansion of existing products, the primary determinant of what constitutes a "specific product" is an item's Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code.  USPS containers fall within Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code 3920 - Materials Handling Equipment, Non Self-Propelled.  FPI has recorded sales in this category every year since FY 1997.

Under FPI's guidelines, the secondary determinant of what constitutes a "specific product" is an item's Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code.  No SIC code specifically includes USPS containers.  The most appropriate SIC codes for USPS containers are:  SIC 3444 - Sheet Metal Work;  SIC 3496 - Misc Fabricated Wire Products; or SIC 3499 - Fabricated Metal Products, N.E.C.  FPI has made items in each of these SIC codes for several years.

FPI has a history of making items in both the FSC code and SIC code for USPS containers.  For this reason, FPI believes USPS containers do not meet the definition of "new product" set forth by FPI's guidelines. However, FPI recognizes that a reasonable person may construe this item to be a product separate and distinct from any other made by FPI. 

Under the terms of FPI's expansion guidelines, interested parties may submit comments regarding this proposed production by FPI. In submitting comments to FPI, the following guidelines will apply:

1) Comments will be due within 21 days of the date of this notice;

2) Relevant comments will focus on and address why USPS containers should be considered a new product, separate and distinct from a similar item currently produced by FPI;

3) While the primary purpose of the comments will be to determine if the item should be defined as a new product, comments related to market share and/or the impact resulting from such a production decision may also be considered relevant.

All comments received in response to this announcement will be considered by FPI.  All commenters will be advised when FPI makes a final determination.  Any interested party has a right to raise any question at any time with FPI's Board of Directors.  

All comments should be addressed to:  Chief Administrative Officer, Planning, Research and Activation Branch, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534.

<SUBJECT>--REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: Department of Defense Traffic Management
<DESC>NA REQUEST FOR INFORMATION Department of Defense Traffic Management  January 9, 2003 1.  Purpose    a.  The Assistant Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Logistics Systems Management), in coordination with the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Transportation Policy), are working together to assess and align key defense transportation systems ar chitectures with the Department of Defense (DoD) Enterprise Architecture.   b.  The objective of this Request For Information (RFI) is to obtain information to better understand commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and government off-the-shelf (GOTS) products and process capabilities that are available to provide DoD transportation off ices with the processes and system capabilities required to optimally move cargo throughout the worldwide Defense Transportation System (DTS).   c.  The DoD seeks to determine whether COTS and/or GOTS solutions and associated processes can singularly, or in part, meet future DoD traffic management technical and operational requirements relating to the movement of cargo. 2.  Scope a.  The scope of this RFI pertains to the functional and operational capabilities of existing COTS and GOTS traffic management solutions and the technical (i.e., architectural) environment in which these solutions operate.   b.  DoD seeks and encourages responses from both vendors and GOTS Program Management Offices (PMO) that currently provide traffic management products.  DoD requests that even vendors of solutions that provide only a portion of the required capabilities (as  presented in this RFI) respond.  It is important for DoD to understand product core capabilities and whether they fit as a modular component within a larger traffic management solution. 3.  Background   a.  DTS Profile.  The DoD is a high volume, high transaction shipping activity that executes over one million shipments annually.  The DTS supports day-to-day peacetime operations and scheduled exercises as well as contingency operations during times of cr ises.  The DTS operates in accordance with the Defense Transportation Regulations (DTR) (http://public.transcom.mil/J4/j4lt/dtr.html).  Regulations pertaining specifically to cargo movement are documented in Part II of the DTR.  Please reference the DTR, P art II, to understand the regulatory environment in which todays DTS operates.  The DoD maintains over 594 DoD shipping activities throughout the world and conducts approximately ten billion dollars worth of business annually, of which about half is assoc iated with cargo movements and traffic management.  In addition to organic moves, the DoD also maintains contracts with approximately 470 commercial carriers across all modes of transportation. b.  Technical Environment.  The DTS requires a web-enabled traffic management system for receiving, distributing, and processing transportation-related information at DoD transportation offices located throughout the world.  Some transportation offices mai ntain constant network and Internet connectivity.  Other transportation offices operate in locations where network and Internet connectivity is intermittent and of poor quality.  In addition, based on todays processes, DoD traffic management systems maint ain a significant number of system interfaces, each having multiple interface agreements/requirements. 4.  Targeted End-State  The DTS seeks to establish a traffic management operational environment comprised of industry proven transportation management best practices characterized by the following:   	Web-enabled, user friendly capable 	Networked or stand-alone modes capable 	Shared data environment 	Systems integrated with trading partner systems (e.g., carriers, financial systems, DoD tracking systems, DoD operations planning systems, etc.) 	Elimination of legacy DoD-unique processes and documents as applicable 	Leveraged use of Automatic Identification Technologies (AIT) 5.  RFI Structure  This RFI contains a qual itative component called General Questionnaire and a quantitative component called RFI Quantitative.xls.  The qualitative component seeks to understand high-level corporate and product information, while the quantitative component seeks to understand p roduct or solution specific capabilities.    6. Instructions to Respondents  Respondents are requested to complete both the qualitative and quantitative components in accordance with the instructions set forth below.  Please go to the Defense Contracting Command  Washington site at http://dccw.hqda. pentagon.mil/tran.htm to access all RFI documents and references. a.  Qualitative Component, General Questionnaire.  The General Questionnaire gathers qualitative-type information regarding your organization, product, and services you provide.  Please answer the questions by typing in the non-shaded cells of the table lo cated at http://dccw.hqda.pentagon.mil/tran.htm.  Please do not type your answers in the shaded cells.  You may include brief descriptions (paragraph or short bulleted list) of your product capabilities, and/or you may provide specific page and paragraph r eferences to product literature that you include with your response.  When completing the General Questionnaire, please save it in the following naming format: RFI Qualitative_{insert company name here}.doc. b.  Quantitative Component (located at http://dccw.hqda.pentagon.mil/tran.htm and called RFI Quantitative.xls).  Please note that these instructions are also provided within the spreadsheet file itself.  The spreadsheet contains specific capabilities-ori ented questions that will help DoD understand the extent to which your product meets DTS functional, operational, and technical requirements.  The sections to be completed by your company are as follows:   Functional Requirements 	Management and Decision Support Analysis (Tab 1.0) 	Outbound (Tab 2.0) 	Inbound  (Tab 3.0) Operational  	Data Acquisition (Tab 4.0 and 5.0) 	General Operational (Tab 4.0 and 5.0) Technical 	Technical / Regulatory (Tab 6.0) 1.  Various functional/capability statements are provided within each of these categories.  Please respond to each statement by selecting Yes, No, Future, 3rd Party, or Custom from the drop down list to the right of the requirement statement (in the Response column).  The Yes, No, Future, 3rd Party, or Custom designations should be applied as follows:  Yes	Application functionality is currently included in the base product. No	Application functionality is not currently included and will not be available in the next 12 months. Future	Application functionality is not currently included but will be available in the next 12 months. 3rd Party 	Functionality is provided by a third party partnering arrangement.  Custom	Functionality is not included in the base product today; however, can be provided by customizing or modifying the base product.  These changes will also be incorporated into the base product. NOTE: Please be specific as to the functionality available in the software release currently available to your customer base.  If functionality is to be provided in a future software release (i.e., Future), please provide the date for its planned availab ility. There is also a Comments column in the spreadsheet where you may provide additional information to each functional/capability statement that you deem necessary and appropriate.   2.  The spreadsheet also includes a Reference Dictionary that provides links to current DoD policies, regulations, documents, and system interface formats that establish many of the requirements unique to the DTS as it operates today.  These references w ill help you understand the current DTS environment.  It is not intended to imply that future investments in traffic management capabilities will require compliance with all of these references.  If you perceive these references as an obstacle to the proce sses and capab ilities that your solution delivers, request your comments include how your solution delivers the required functionality in the absence of these regulations.  The Reference Dictionary is contained in the last tab of the file (RFI Quantitative.xls). 3.  When completing the quantitative component (RFI Quantiative.xls), please save it in the following naming format: RFI Quantitative_{insert company name}.xls. 	     c.  Format and Submission.  RFI responses must be entered directly into the General Questionnaire and in the spreadsheet called TM RFI Quantitative.xls, in the format described above.  Both of these documents are located at http://dccw.hqda.pentagon. mil/tran.htm.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation, N00173-03-R-TB04, is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular  FAC 01- 11 dated 31 December 2002. The associated NAICS code is 334516 and small business size standard is 500 employees.  NRL has a requirement for a research grade molecular beam mass spectrometer (0-300 amu, 0.5 amu or better resolution) with thoriated iridium filaments which is computer interfaced and software controlled to carry out plasma diagnostics in a variety of plasma enhanced deposition systems. The instrument will mainly be used to interrogating the plasma chemistry leading to fluxes of reactive positive and negative ions and open shell neutral species in discharges containing organic precursors formed in a UHV compatible chamber. Nominally, the plasma itself is cold, being at or slightly above room temperature with 5 30 Volt plasma potentials. NRL will also investigate the role of ion energies on growing films, thus necessitating the construction and incorporation of an integral, independently biasable, temperature controlled, sampling chuck. The plasma source operates from 5 to hundreds of millitorr, thus requiring two stages of differential pumping and a variable frequency and duty factor shutter on the instrument sampling orifice. At this time the plasma generation is inherently a pulsed process, but NRL is capable of generating continuous operation as well. Basic applications: NRL must be able to detect positive ions, neutral species and negative ions during all parts of the discharge and the afterglow. Data acquisition would preferably be Windows compliant and allow compatibility with other software applications, through "Export" or "Cut 'n Paste" capabilities. NRL requires real time resolution of one microsecond i.e. the detector/preamp has to be gateable to one microsecond, with the gate delay and width being externally triggerable and easily set within the QMS control software. Scannable gating and signal averaging is required as well, similar to boxcar averaging techniques, from within the software. Species detection must also be easily set within the software, switching from positive ions, neutrals and negative ions (i.e. no hardware changes that requires demounting or venting of the spectrometer). Energy analysis of all species is necessary as well with resolution better than 0.5 eV. In order to identify and quantify reactive neutral radical species present in the incident surface flux, NLR will routinely perform appearance potential mass spectrometry. The instrument will require software programmable electron impact ionizer electronics capable of smoothly tuning from 0-150 eV with energy resolution better than 0.5 eV.The Specifications are as follows: 1.	Vacuum Manifold and Pumping: Two stages of differential pumping optimized for process pressures up to 100 mtorr. System must mate to an 8" OD conflat flange. System must be configured to operate in both singly and doubly differential pumping configurations. 
A. First stage pumping chamber
1. Turbo molecular pump mounting flange for horizontal pump monitoring. Flange type: 6" OD Conflat
2. Mounting flange for the second stage vacuum/ mass spectrometer manifold. Flange type: 6" OD Conflat
3. Pressure gauge port. Flange type: 2 3/4" OD Conflat
4. Sampling orifice/mounting flange/support mechanism custom configured for NRL's process chamber specifications to provided as Government furnished equipment (GFE). Price to include sampling orifice kit with interchangeable orifice to enable sampling over wide pressure range.
B. Second Stage pumping chamber
1. Quadrupole mass filter housing with skimmer cone with adjustable bellows to enable fine positioning of the second stage orifice with the molecular beam axis
2 Pumping manifold tee with flanges for attachment of: 
a)	quadrupole mass filter housing, 
b)	quadrupole gauge head 
c)	turbo molecular pump 
d)	Penning gauge
11. Vacuum gauging: The manufacturer will provide the following gauges: 
A. First stage:
1. Ionization gauge for high vacuum with pressure range from 1.0 E-10 torr to 1.0 E-03 torr.
2. Thermal Conductivity gauge for foreline with range from 1.0 E-4 to 1.0 E 02 torr.
B. Second Stage:
1. Ionization gauge for high vacuum equipped with quadrupole overpressure protection circuit with pressure range from 1.0 E-10 torr to 1.0 E-03 torr.
2. Thermal Conductivity for foreline with range from 1.0 E-4 to 1.0 E 02 torr.
C. Controllers:
1. Ionization gauge, dual channel
2. Thermal Conductivity gauge, dual channel
111. Required Capabilities
