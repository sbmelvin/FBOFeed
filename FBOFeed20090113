<DESC><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - USAFE</span></strong>
<p><strong>SCOPE</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><br />The purpose of this notice is to obtain information from interested industry sources to aid the U.S. Government in the development of the contracting strategy and Performance Work Statement (PWS) for in-theater depot maintenance services. This requirement will support United States Air Force A-10C aircraft stationed at Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany. <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL</span>. The information requested is for planning purposes only and DOES NOT COMMIT the U.S. Government to provide compensation for information requested nor does it commit the U.S. Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract. This notice does not provide any direction nor does it change any contractual obligations to sources currently under contract with the U.S. Government.</p>
<p><br /><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><br />The A/OA-10 Thunderbolt II, commonly known as the Warthog, is a highly maneuverable, low-altitude, close air support aircraft built around a 30mm seven-barrel Gatling gun and powered by two General Electric TF34-GE-100 turbofans. The aircraft is designed for combat survivability and can employ a variety of free-fall and precision guided munitions as well as a full compliment of self-protection chaff and flares. The first production Fairchild Republic A-10A was delivered to the United States Air Force (USAF) in October 1975 and achieved Initial Operating Capability in 1977. In 2006, the USAF began modifying A-10A aircraft with the Precision Engagement (PE) modification which adds upgraded cockpit displays, digital stores management, advanced targeting pod integration, and other improvements. Precision engagement modified aircraft are designated as the A-10C.</p>
<p><br />The A-10C has surpassed its original design life but has been tasked to remain in service with the USAF until at least 2028. However, as result of the 30+ years of operational service, the aircraft is yielding to the effects of fatigue and corrosion. To extend the life of the aircraft, the USAF has implemented depot-level maintenance inspection/repair programs for the wing, fuselage, nacelle, and other fatigue-critical components. These inspection/repair programs are designated as the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) and Scheduled Structure Inspection (SSI). SLEP is a once-per aircraft procedure that began in Fiscal Year 2002 (FY02) and is scheduled to be completed on all aircraft by Fiscal Year 2013 (FY13). Once an aircraft has undergone SLEP, an SSI will be accomplished every 2000 flying hours or 1600 landings, or 8 years (whichever comes first) until the end of its service life.</p>
<p><br />Since 1993, the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) has operated a squadron of approximately 22 A-10C aircraft. These aircraft are operated, maintained, and employed by the 52nd Fighter Wing, Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany. To reduce the costs and issues associated with ferrying aircraft from Spangdahlem AB to the Continental United States for depot level maintenance, the USAFE requested the establishment of a contractor depot facility within the European theater. In 2001, the A/OA-10 System Program Office (SPO) awarded a contract through fair and open competition to establish an in-theater depot facility to support USAFE A-10 aircraft. The period of performance on the existing depot-services contract is nearing conclusion. As required by U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulations, the A/OA-10 SPO is pursuing a follow-on competition to select a contractor to perform the requested in-theater depot services beginning in FY10.</p>
<p><br /><strong>CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><br />The A/OA-10 System Program Office is seeking interested sources to provide in-theater depot maintenance support for the 22 USAFE A-10C aircraft. Depot-level maintenance is defined as that materiel maintenance requiring major overhaul or a complete rebuilding of parts, assemblies, subassemblies, and end items, including the manufacture of parts, modifications, testing, and reclamation as required. Depot maintenance serves to support lower categories of maintenance by providing technical assistance and performing that maintenance beyond the responsibility or capability of lower levels of maintenance.</p>
<p><br />The specific work requirements to be accomplished on this proposed contract order are outlined in the attached PWS. This PWS is still in draft form and is subject to change. Please note that the work requirements in the work specification attachments for aircraft paint, SLEP and SSI have been removed from the PWS for the purpose of this RFI. These attachments will contain the specific inspection criteria and additional work requirements for these services. Please direct any questions related to the work requirements for these efforts to the Contracting Representative listed in this RFI.</p>
<p><br />The U.S Government intends to make a single award to a technically responsive source with a 5-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract. The estimated workload is 3-6 aircraft inductions per fiscal year for SLEP/SSI plus occasional drop-in maintenance and Contract Field Team deployments as necessary. In order to be considered for this workload, a qualified offeror must operate the proposed depot maintenance facility within unrefueled A-10 flight range (approximately 400 Nautical Miles) of Spangdahlem AB, Germany.</p>
<p><br /><strong>INSRUCTIONS FOR INTERESTED SOURCES</strong></p>
<p><br />This Request for Information (RFI) is an invitation for all interested and qualified sources to review the draft PWS and provide the USAF A-10 Program Office feedback and other information to be considered for planning purposes. In addition, you may ask questions regarding this requirement which will be answered by the USAF A-10 System Program Office (SPO) and posted as updates to this notice. All responses should be submitted to the U.S. Government Contracting representative listed below. <br />Please review the draft PWS in its entirety and provide comments and feedback to include recommended additions, deletions, or revisions that you feel should be considered by the USAF. If you choose, you may insert comments directly into the Microsoft Word copy of the PWS and submit them electronically to the Contracting representative listed below.</p>
<p><strong>The USAF A-10 SPO is most interested in the following topics with respect to the PWS:</strong></p>
<p><br />1. Is the requirement/scope clearly stated and understandable?</p>
<p><br />2. Are all requirements/instructions clear and unambiguous to a maintenance facility?</p>
<p><br />3. Are there any areas where the government is being too restrictive and not permitting the use of commercial best practices or industry standards?</p>
<p><br />4. Is sufficient detail provided throughout the document to prepare an accurate proposal?</p>
<p><br />5. Do any requirements seem unreasonable or unrealistic?</p>
<p><br />6. Are there any additional requirements that should be added to help ensure that the government meets its contract objectives and receives a quality deliverable?</p>
<p><br /><strong>In addition to feedback on the PWS, the USAF A-10 Program Office is also interested in receiving responses to the following questions:</strong></p>
<p><br />1. This contract will be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity</p>

<DESC><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - PACAF</span></strong>
<p><strong>SCOPE</strong></p>
<strong></strong>
<p><br />The purpose of this notice is to obtain information from interested industry sources to aid the U.S. Government in the development of the contracting strategy and Performance Work Statement (PWS) for in-theater depot maintenance services. This requirement will support United States Air Force A-10C aircraft stationed at Osan Air Base, Republic of South Korea. <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.</span> The information requested is for planning purposes only and DOES NOT COMMIT the U.S. Government to provide compensation for information requested nor does it commit the U.S. Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract. This notice does not provide any direction nor does it change any contractual obligations to sources currently under contract with the U.S. Government.</p>
<p><br /><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p><br />The A/OA-10 Thunderbolt II, commonly known as the Warthog, is a highly maneuverable, low-altitude, close air support aircraft built around a 30mm seven-barrel Gatling gun and powered by two General Electric TF34-GE-100 turbofans. The aircraft is designed for combat survivability and can employ a variety of free-fall and precision guided munitions as well as a full compliment of self-protection chaff and flares. The first production Fairchild Republic A-10A was delivered to the United States Air Force (USAF) in October 1975 and achieved Initial Operating Capability in 1977. In 2006, the USAF began modifying A-10A aircraft with the Precision Engagement (PE) modification which adds upgraded cockpit displays, digital stores management, advanced targeting pod integration, and other improvements. Precision engagement modified aircraft are designated as the A-10C.</p>
<p><br />The A-10C has surpassed its original design life but has been tasked to remain in service with the USAF until at least 2028. However, as result of the 30+ years of operational service, the aircraft is yielding to the effects of fatigue and corrosion. To extend the life of the aircraft, the USAF has implemented depot-level maintenance inspection/repair programs for the wing, fuselage, nacelle, and other fatigue-critical components. These inspection/repair programs are designated as the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) and Scheduled Structure Inspection (SSI). SLEP is a once-per aircraft procedure that began in Fiscal Year 2002 (FY02) and is scheduled to be completed on all aircraft by Fiscal Year 2013 (FY13). Once an aircraft has undergone SLEP, an SSI will be accomplished every 2000 flying hours or 1600 landings, or 8 years (whichever comes first) until the end of its service life.</p>
<p><br />Since 1993, the United States Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) has operated a squadron of approximately 27 A/OA-10 aircraft. These aircraft are operated, maintained, and employed by the 51st Fighter Wing, Osan Air Base, Republic of South Korea. To reduce the costs and issues associated with ferrying aircraft from Osan AB to the Continental United States for depot level maintenance, PACAF requested the establishment of a contractor depot facility within the Korean theater. In 2001, the A/OA-10 System Program Office (SPO) awarded a contract through fair and open competition to establish an in-theater depot facility to support PACAF A-10 aircraft. The period of performance on the existing depot-services contract is nearing conclusion. As required by U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulations, the A/OA-10 SPO is pursuing a follow-on competition to select a contractor to perform the requested in-theater depot services beginning in FY10.</p>
<p><br /><strong>CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<p><br />The A/OA-10 System Program Office is seeking interested sources to provide in-theater depot maintenance support for the 27 PACAF A-10C aircraft. Depot-level maintenance is defined as that materiel maintenance requiring major overhaul or a complete rebuilding of parts, assemblies, subassemblies, and end items, including the manufacture of parts, modifications, testing, and reclamation as required. Depot maintenance serves to support lower categories of maintenance by providing technical assistance and performing that maintenance beyond the responsibility or capability of lower levels of maintenance.</p>
<p><br />The specific work requirements to be accomplished on this proposed contract order are outlined in the attached PWS. This PWS is still in draft form and is subject to change. Please note that the work requirements in the work specification attachments for aircraft paint, SLEP and SSI have been removed from the PWS for the purpose of this RFI. These attachments will contain the specific inspection criteria and additional work requirements for these services. Please direct any questions related to the work requirements for these efforts to the Contracting Representative listed in this RFI.</p>
<p><br />The U.S Government intends to make a single award to a technically responsive source with a 5-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract. The estimated workload is 3-6 aircraft inductions per fiscal year for SSI plus occasional drop-in maintenance and Contract Field Team deployments as necessary. Installation of the Precision Engagement modification for all 27 aircraft is currently forecasted to be accomplished over the first two years of the contract period (FY10-11). In order to be considered for this workload, a qualified offeror must operate the proposed depot maintenance facility within unrefueled A-10 flight range (approximately 400 Nautical Miles) of Osan AB, Republic of South Korea.</p>
<p><strong>INSRUCTIONS FOR INTERESTED SOURCES</strong></p>
<p><br />This Request for Information (RFI) is an invitation for all interested and qualified sources to review the draft PWS and provide the USAF A-10 Program Office feedback and other information to be considered for planning purposes. In addition, you may ask questions regarding this requirement which will be answered by the USAF A-10 System Program Office (SPO) and posted as updates to this notice. All responses should be submitted to the U.S. Government Contracting representative listed below. <br />Please review the draft PWS in its entirety and provide comments and feedback to include recommended additions, deletions, or revisions that you feel should be considered by the USAF. If you choose, you may insert comments directly into the Microsoft Word copy of the PWS and submit them electronically to the Contracting representative listed below.</p>
<p><strong>The USAF A-10 SPO is most interested in the following topics with respect to the PWS:</strong></p>
<p><br />1. Is the requirement/scope clearly stated and understandable?</p>
<p><br />2. Are all requirements/instructions clear and unambiguous to a maintenance facility?</p>
<p><br />3. Are there any areas where the government is being too restrictive and not permitting the use of commercial best practices or industry standards?</p>
<p><br />4. Is sufficient detail provided throughout the document to prepare an accurate proposal?</p>
<p><br />5. Do any requirements seem unreasonable or unrealistic?</p>
<p><br />6. Are there any additional requirements that should be added to help ensure that the government meets its contract objectives and receives a quality deliverable?</p>
<p><br /><strong>In addition to feedback on the PWS, the USAF A-10 Program Office is also interested in receiving responses to the following questions:</strong></p>
<p><br />1. This contract will be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity requirement. The government is aware that industry would prefer the largest minimum quantity of orders possible to be guaranteed on the contract ordering period. Given an estimated workload of 3-6 aircraft inductions per year for SLEP/SSI, please comment on the impact to a price proposal if the minimum quantity was set at one aircraft induction per year versus three aircraft per year.</p>
<p>2. What kind of import/export fees or restrictions may be imposed on this contract by the host nation in which your maintenance facility is or is to be located? Please reference or provide any applicable agreements between the host nation and the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>3. What kind of learning curve should be expected for this requirement? What effect will the expected learning curve have on the flow days for completing an aircraft delivery?</p>
<p>4. For other than incumbent contractors, what is the estimated stand-up period after contract award to be ready to induct the first aircraft? Please comment on various considerations such as configuring a facility, obtaining necessary equipment/materials, training a work force, etcetera. What kind of ideas/options may be available to minimize the stand-up period?</p>
<p>5. What kind of source selection criteria should the Government consider using in the solicitation to select a contractor that is qualified, capable, and can provide the "best value" to the Government?</p>
<p>6. Are there any aspects of this requirement where a contractor could suggest additional value to the government above and beyond what the government is currently requesting?</p>
<p>7. Given that the U.S. Government is under a tight schedule to meet the desired contract award date, do you feel it is desirable/beneficial for the government to issue a draft RFP prior the formal RFP? Please comment on the perceived benefits and consequences of a draft RFP for this effort.</p>
<p>8. For commercial aircraft repair contracts similar in nature to this requirement, what kinds of warranty terms are included for the work performed?</p>
<p>9. What kind of contractor performance assessment metrics are used in commercial aircraft repair contracts to assess the quality and timeliness of the work performed?</p>
<p>10. Do you foresee any specific problems with diminishing sources of supply or problems procuring any needed materials/equipment?</p>
<p>11. Past experience has revealed issues with providing foreign contractors U.S. Air Force Technical Orders (TOs). What is your experience dealing with technical data on U.S. Government contracts? What suggestions can you offer to reduce problems associated with foreign contractors obtaining/managing a TO library?</p>
<p>12. The government is interested in including incentive-fee terms in this contract which would provide additional compensation to the contractor for meeting schedule and/or quality/performance objectives. Do you feel it is desirable to include such terms? What kind of objectives and assessment metrics should be included in the contract to provide the basis for the incentive-fee?

<p>13. If you consider yourself a qualified source for this requirement but for whatever reason do not intend to bid on this requirement, what is your main reason(s) for not bidding? What can the government do to make this requirement more attractive?</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this Pre-Solicitation Notice is to obtain services to support the Consolidated Renal Operations in a Web-enabled Network (CROWN) Systems Development & Maintenance.  This information is being provided as informational only and it does not obligate the Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract.

All efforts shall be performed in accordance with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) requirements and shall meet the objectives of increasing efficiency and effectiveness of operations and timely implementation of statutory and regulatory requirements. This is a Set Aside for 8(a) business. The estimated level of effort for the contract is approximately 75,000 hours per year (Base + 6). CMS anticipates awarding this contract in July/August 2009; the Period of Performance will be Base + 6 12-month option years.

The current contractor that develops and maintains the CROWN application group is Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC).  If you have any questions regarding this solicitation, you may only contact the Contracting Officer and Contract Specialist, contacting anyone else that may be listed may jeopardize the integrity of the solicitation.

History:  

The Consolidated Renal Operations in a Web-enabled Network (CROWN) application group, supports the End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Network program, ESRD dialysis providers, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) community.  CROWN is an application group currently consisting of the Renal Management Information System (REMIS), the Standard Information Management System (SIMS), and the Vital Information System to Improve Outcomes in Nephrology (VISION) along with all associated databases and architecture.  In February 2009 the first version of two new systems, (CROWNWeb) and the QualityNet Identity Provisioning System (QIPS), will be placed in production.  These new systems will become part of the CROWN application group and SIMS and VISION will be retired.

Prior to CROWN, each ESRD Network was responsible for developing solutions to meet the data entry and reporting requirements of their Statement of Work.  Besides the obvious inefficiencies of redundant systems and costs, each ESRD Network had different competencies related to automated data processing (ADP) activities.  Since the inception of CROWN, the functions of CROWN have encompassed support, standardization, and development of data, software, and standards for the ESRD Network community.  With the release of CROWNWeb V1.0, CROWN will continue to evolve with innovative technology to meet the challenges of supporting and interfacing directly with the ESRD Network community and surrounding healthcare industry.

The CROWN User Community refers to the ESRD Networks, ESRD dialysis facilities, CMS Central and Regional Offices, and other organizations/partners that may be incorporated in support of CMS initiatives.

It is anticipated the final award will be to the entity providing the best competitive price through the FedBid process.  As this is a brand name justification it is supporting existing HP equipment that has reached end of life that will be replaced and moved to the SMS lab for future testing.<BR><BR>

<DESC>In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) paragraph 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the basis for the FAA's decision to contract with Composite Technology, Inc. via single source procedures.
During a routine scheduled inspection of a Sikorsky Helicopter it was discovered that the "Black" Main Rotor Blade butt was damaged. Composite Technology, Inc. is the only known authorized repair facility for Sikorsky Helicopter blades. This facility maintains all repair records and approved repair planforms. It is, therefore, the only source available for the repair of the blade the FAA is currently using to support their requirements and therefore cannot be obtained through any other known source.  
A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  If your firm does not agree with this single source determination, please provide evidence of your firm's capabilities and experience in providing the above service.  The FAA will evaluate this accordingly.  All responses to this announcement must be directed to Karen Mercer not later than 12 noon, Easter Standard Time, 27 January 2009.  Responses may be sent via e-mail to Karen.Mercer@faa.gov.

However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities, which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA. The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing, and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NOAA to determine if the party can meet all of the foregoing requirements.

<DESC>Per FEDBIZOPS announcement on 2 October 2008, the United States Navy stated its  requirement for a cost effective aerial target system to represent Subsonic Anti-Ship Cruise Missile Threats and air platforms. This Subsonic Aerial Target (SSAT) System will be used to support developmental and operational testing of naval combat systems while providing services in support of advanced fleet training.

The SSAT will be a recoverable aerial target vehicle capable of realistically representing enemy threats that operate in the subsonic regime. The SSAT will be launch capable from ashore, at sea or by air and will be remotely controlled utilizing the System for Navy Target Control (SNTC).

The Navy plans on releasing a competitive solicitation for the limited development and refinement of an existing target system to achieve Navy requirements.

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to announce Naval Air Systems Command?s (NAVAIR) intention to conduct a full and open competition to procure a Joint and Allied Threat Awareness System (JATAS).  The objective of the JATAS effort is to develop a cost effective threat awareness system to enhance aircraft survivability by providing advanced missile warning capability; aircrew warning of laser-based weapon systems such as range finders, illuminators, and beam riders; and a Hostile Fire Indication for small arms, rockets, and other threats.  JATAS must interface with existing AN/ALE-47 Countermeasures Dispensing System (CMDS), and be capable of interfacing with a laser based Directed Infrared Countermeasure as part of electronic countermeasures response to attacking infrared missiles.  The JATAS will be controlled by the host aircraft?s mission computer with operator interface/control being accomplished via the multifunctional display or a separate control indicator.  In most cases, command and control of the JATAS will be through the AN/APR-39A/B(V)2 Radar Signal Detecting Set (RSDS).
This anticipated JATAS System Development Demonstration (SDD) contract will include supporting the integration of JATAS onto the MV-22B lead platform and developing the interfaces necessary to deploy JATAS to other rotary wing platforms.  The JATAS SDD effort will include (but not be limited to) the fabrication of test articles, support for aircraft integration testing and Systems Integration Laboratory Development, support for live fire testing, and providing support for attendant data reduction for the integration/live fire tests.  The JATAS SDD contractor will develop supporting logistics documentation, support the definition of software sustainment requirements and software facility development, and conduct program management, engineering management, and configuration management throughout the JATAS program.

NAVAIR will only release the Solicitation/RFP, including any subsequent amendments, over the Internet. NAVAIR will post the Solicitation/RFP and all amendments on the NAVAIR home page.  The RFP will not be posted on any other WEB site.  The NAVAIR Homepage is located at http://www.navair.navy.mil and can be accessed using Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer. To access the JATAS RFP, select ?Doing Business With Us?, and then ?Open Solicitations? under the heading entitled ?Selling Products and Services to NAVAIR.?

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest is extending the current 8(a) Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) from 25 April 2009 to 24 April 2010 and is seeking Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) "Developmental Stage" (first four years of the 8(a) program) construction firms with a bona fide place of business in one of four SBA Districts (San Diego, Santa Ana, Los Angeles, California and Phoenix, Arizona) to participate in this BOA program. CURRENT BOA HOLDERS DO NOT NEED TO REAPPLY FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. The Navy is targeting the issuance of an indeterminate number of BOAs. The estimated period of performance for the BOA will be one year. The purpose of the BOA is to enhance contracting opportunities to qualified 8(a) Developmental Stage construction firms that are located in one of the four specified SBA Districts. The BOA is not a contract, but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwe! st and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered. The BOA provides a framework of contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms, and conditions which will apply, to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each order, to any firm order for services issued pursuant to the agreement. Each order issued under this BOA shall constitute a separate contract. Under the BOA, firms with an applicable NAICS code compete on task orders for requirements within the designated SBA District where the work is to be performed. If adequate competition cannot be obtained within the designated SBA District, the Government reserves the right to open the area of competition to include BOA holders in adjacent districts. The anticipated types of construction may include emergency repairs (broken and leaking water lines, roof leaks, HVAC, and other mechanical projects), minor construction projects (exterior and i! nterior renovations, demolition, painting, and installing pipelines), and design assistance (on-site design solution for emergency calls and design/build services for minor construction items). Only NAICS Subsectors 236, 237, and 238 pertain to this BOA. Each firm will identify their primary NAICS code and a secondary NAICS code (if applicable). There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement; however, there is a maximum dollar amount of $3,500,000 per firm over the life of the agreement. Individual task orders will range between $2,000 and $750,000. The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond or Surety Letter (as applicable) with each proposal over $25,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each order. Annually the Navy and the SBA will review the continued need for this agreement in light of a) usefulness and need for service and b) the effectiveness of individual contractors. The Contracting Officer will open/advertise the BOA program for new entrants once a year.!  Options will not be exercised for firms that do not continue to meet all BOA requirements and will be removed accordingly. No new orders will be issued to the Contractor and this agreement will terminate. Termination of the BOA under these circumstances shall have no effect on any orders previously issued. The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder. Modification of the BOA shall not retroactively affect orders issued prior to the time of the modification. This agreement may be cancelled by either party by mailing or otherwise transmitting 30 days prior written notice to the other party. Any such cancellation shall have no effect on any orders issued prior to the effective date of the cancellation, which shall be 30 days from the date of mailing or otherwise transmitting the written notice of cancellation. Prior to the effective date of cancellation, the Navy may continue to place orders under the BOA. F! irms that demonstrate that they meet the following qualifications will receive a BOA. Upon submission of the following information, the Government will review the documents and the firm will be determined to be either eligible or ineligible. To qualify for receipt of a BOA, each firm must meet all the following criteria: (1) Be a certified 8(a) Developmental Stage participant (Joint Venture/Mentor Protege firms are not allowed) prior to the submission date of March 5, 2009; have a bona fide place of business in one of four SBA Districts (San Diego, Santa Ana, Los Angeles, CA or Phoenix, AZ); (2) Be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at http://www.ccr.gov/, including the new SBA Dynamic Small Business Listing; Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at https://orca.bpn.gov/; and VETS-100 at https://vets100.vets.dol.gov/ (if not applicable, provide a statement that the firm has not had contracts subject to this requirement); (3) Be licensed/bonded and fully capable to perform construction wo! rk within a range of $2,000 - $750,000; and (4) Demonstrate technical experience/past performance (including safety) of similar size, general scope, and complexity of construction project(s) under NAICS Subsectors 236, 237, and/or 238 within the last three years. TO BE CONSIDERED, INTERESTED FIRMS MUST DOWNLOAD AND USE THE CHECKLIST FROM THIS WEBSITE TO ENSURE ALL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED. Please submit your package to NAVFAC Southwest, Attn: Michelle Sanders, Code RAQ20.MS, 1220 Pacific Highway, San Diego, CA 92132, or via email to michelle.sanders@navy.mil not later than 2:00 PM Pacific time on March 5, 2009.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), the Department of Defenses Medical School and Health Sciences University, hereby announces its intent to acquire on a sole source basis with Primate Products in Redwood, CA for eight (8) Macaca Mulatta, Chinese origin, Male, 3.5 to7.5 years, and 3.4 to 8 kilo-grams. These non-human primates (NHPs) are for an ongoing experiment. During the first phrase of this study 22 NHPs were obtained from Primate Products. Genetic uniformity is critical to compare the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> phrase of the results. Generation traits of each breeding stock differ between breeders of similar NHPs and could potentially produce different results that will make comparisons with existing data impossible. Because of this, the primates must come from the same breeder as that used in previous experiments to ensure consistency. This award is IAW FAR Part 13.106-1(1) (b) and authorizes USUHS to award contracts when only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. All inquires may be addressed to Kali Shelton, 4301 Jones Bridge Road, Room A1040C, Bethesda, MD 20814-4799 by January 21, 2008 at 12:00 p.m.</p>

<DESC>Reclamation is seeking an industry partner willing and able to enter into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to mature and commercialize patent-pending membrane separation technologies.  The CRADA partner should be willing and able to commit their financial and capability resources toward this effort.  The CRADA partner will be required to be located in the United States, manufacture membrane technology commercialized under the CRADA substantially within the U.S, and demonstrate specific qualifications and capabilities.  Reclamation has filed U.S. patent applications, and Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications.  The PCTs will expire in November 2009, therefore any foreign rights sought by the CRADA partner will have to be applied for prior to that date.
This is not a procurement.  A CRADA essentially authorizes federal agencies to pool their expertise, know-how, and facilities with non-federal entities to research and mature technologies for commercial applications.  A CRADA also authorizes the non-federal partner to contribute funding toward the collaborative effort but does not authorize the transfer of federal funds to the non-federal partner.  15 USC 3710a provides a complete description of CRADAs, authorized activities, and the associated licensing and other benefits provided to industry CRADA partners.  For information or to obtain specific qualifications, contact Samantha Zhang, 303-445-2126, szhang@do.usbr.gov.  Please respond by February 13, 2009.

<DESC><p>Contracting Office Address: Department of Homeland Security, Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), Biocontainment Procurement Branch, Procurement Division, TH378C, 1131 Chapel Crossing Road, Glynco, GA 31524</p>
<p>Description of project: Contractor will furnish all labor, material, supervision and equipment to construct the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF). As published in the Final Environmental Impact Statement, which was posted to the NBAF web site on December 8, 2008, the Manhattan, KS site, located on the campus at Kansas State University, has been selected as the preferred alternative. The Record of Decision (ROD), which was published on January 12, 2009, confirmed the selection of the Manhattan, KS site. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has proposed to augment existing capabilities through the construction and operation of the NBAF. Operation of this biosafety level (BSL) 2, 3E, 3Ag, and 4 research facility would enable basic and advanced research, diagnostic testing and validation, countermeasure development (i.e., vaccines and anti-viral therapies) and diagnostic training for high-consequence livestock diseases with potentially devastating impacts to U.S. agriculture and public health. The proposed construction is as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Construct two laboratory facilities. One of the two laboratory buildings would be the primary research building containing the BSL-2, BSL-3E, and BSL-3Ag and BSL-4 laboratories with associated support spaces. The other building would be a laboratory for small-scale vaccine and reagent production. It will be located adjacent to the primary research laboratory.</p>
<p>&bull; Construct four outbuildings which include a central utility plant, an entry guard house, a central receiving facility and parking.<br /><br />&bull; The approximate area needed for the NBAF is between 500,000 and 520,000 square feet.</p>
<p>The Government intends to utilize the Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) concept for this procurement. Under this contract the CMc will function as a collaborative member of the project team and shall be an active participant in pre-construction by providing expertise during the design process, to include reviewing designs, preparing cost estimates, reconciling estimates with the A-E, controlling schedules, and performing constructability reviews. The CMc will be responsible for all construction under a single contract. The services requested of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design and construction activities which are often performed by both Construction Managers and general contractors. The CMc must maintain a team with the expertise and capability to manage and coordinate the timely and orderly development and construction of the proposed project. The CMC shall be required to assign, as needed, a team consisting of architectural, civil, structural, mechanical and electrical reviewers; cost estimators; CPM analysts; field engineers; field support staff; construction supervisors; construction superintendents; testing engineers/technicians; major subcontractors, and other disciplines. The CMc shall provide the Government with sound management advice regarding the approach to the project, how to achieve the best value in the work being accomplished, schedule control, alternative ideas, problem prevention, and budgeting. The CMc shall have a full understanding of the project, its contract documents, and the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration. Most importantly, the CMc shall have complete responsibility for construction of the facility. At a pre-determined point in the design phase, likely at about 70%, a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) will be negotiated and construction of the project will begin. The CMc will be contractually bound to pay for costs that exceed the GMP unless the Government changes the scope. The estimated construction cost is about $525 - $575 million, to include the CMc's Preconstruction and Construction Phase Services. This procurement will be negotiated on a best value basis in accordance with FAR 15.101, based primarily on a trade-off between relevancy and quality of present/past performance, qualifications/experience of proposed key personnel, proposed key subcontractors, proposed commissioning agent, and price, with all evaluation factors other than price, when combined, considered significantly more important than price. The best overall value to the Government includes demonstrating a commitment to construction excellence, providing and maintaining a viable team organization and adherence to the budgetary and time parameters for this project. Offerors will be evaluated on relevant corporate experience, past performance on contracts of similar scope and magnitude where the offeror acted as prime contractor or CMc, Key Personnel, to include experience and qualification of proposed staff, and price. The price proposal will include pricing of the CMc's cost of Pre-construction Services and a total fee for Construction Phase Services, including profit, General Conditions, and other overhead costs. Interested firms should, as early as possible, but no later than close of business on February 6, 2009, indicate interest in this acquisition by letter (no more than 2 typewritten pages), referencing the solicitation number, with a brief summary of experience in relevant contracts (scope and magnitude) where the offeror acted as a prime contractor or CMc, particularly in the construction of BioSafety Level 2, 3E, 3Ag, 4 laboratories, animal vivariums, necropsies, or similar facilities. The offeror should describe its performance of the pre-construction and construction phase services provided. The letter should clearly identify the business size, i.e., large business, small business, 8(a), HUBZone, VOSB, SDVOSB, WOSB, etc. Due to the estimated value of this project, the letter must also provide the offerors bonding capacity (single project, aggregate limit, and bonding currently available). Letters should be sent to the attention of Robert E. Driggers, Contracting Officer, at the contracting office address listed above, preferably as an e-mail attachment, with a copy to Ms. Paulette Webster. (E-mail addresses are provided below). More detailed present/past performance information will be required with proposals. In response to the solicitation, offerors will be required to demonstrate their ability to perform projects of a similar scope and magnitude, perform quality work, complete projects on schedule, and at a reasonable price. Award of the resulting contract will not necessarily be made to the lowest priced offeror. It is the intent of the Government to negotiate and award a contract to a well qualified firm with extensive experience in performing projects of similar scope and magnitude. The Government anticipates significant subcontracting activity under this contract. The solicitation will be available about mid-March 2009, with proposals due about early May, 2009. The Government intends to use the results of this Sources-Sought Notice to determine acquisition strategy for this procurement, utilizing NAICS Code 236220, Size Standard $33.5M. If you are interested in this solicitation, please provide the information required above, point of contact, company phone, fax number and e-mail address, to Robert E. Driggers, Contracting Officer, phone 912-261-3630, fax 912-261-4176, or email: Bob.Driggers@dhs.gov or Paulette Webster, Procurement Technician, phone 912-554-4613, email: Paulette.Webster@dhs.gov no later than close of business on February 6, 2009. THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.</p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of qualified small business (including certified 8(a), HUBZone, services disable veteran-owned) that can provide access to health care practitioner prescribing data.    Continued access to healthcare practitioner prescribing practices data (e.g. physician survey, electronic medical records) will complement and strengthen the utility of FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) currently in place.  Access to these data also increases the FDAs ability to perform regulatory impact studies; in particular, those studies that assess the effectiveness of product labeling in influencing prescribing behavior. Finally, direct access to these data in real time enhances and accelerates the pace of FDA's regulatory decision-making process. The contractor shall provide the following:  Provide FDA personnel with real-time, unlimited, immediate, direct, multi-user, desktop access to currently existing, commercially available, data on health care practitioner prescribing practices including but not limited to patient demographics, and indications for treatment in the outpatient setting using surveys and/or electronic medical records; data with the capability of providing national patterns of health care practitioner prescribing patterns in the outpatient setting through the use of projection or other appropriate methodologies that are scientifically sound and transparent to FDA personnel; data with a maximum of a 6-month lag time, i.e., time between the date of prescriber/patient encounter and date of the data availability for FDA use. Provide FDA Personnel with it direct, unlimited, Internet or network-based access to all HIPAA-compliant data in a multi-user environment and in real time.  1) Data Requirements. The successful Contractor shall have continuous access to data resources on health care practitioner prescribing practices including, but not limited to drug treatment patterns, patient demographics and indications for treatment in the outpatient setting throughout the length of the contract.  The source data can be obtained from electronic medical records (EMR) or a survey of healthcare practitioner prescribing practices.   FDA requires access to such data to obtain national estimates or counts.  The FDA has no interest in knowing the identity of any patient, provider, or health plan included in the data.  It shall be solely the Contractors responsibility to de-identify the data for FDA use For survey data, the Contractor shall project the data to the national level using a FDA approved projection or other appropriate methodology.  Results from projections shall be comparable to estimates obtained from national benchmarks such as the National Center for Health Statistics National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS).   For EMR data, FDA understands that the data may or may not be projected.  If EMR data are projected, the above applies.  The data resource(s) shall have raw/sample and projected numbers throughout the length of the contract.  These data resources shall be accessible via a secure Internet or network-based method permitting simultaneous, multi-user access through a user friendly data query tool(s). The health care practitioners (e.g., physicians, physicians assistants, nurse practitioners, dentists) prescribing practices data shall include visits, and patients; characterization of individual health care practitioners in terms of number, specialty, practice setting, age, gender, geographic region and U.S. Census region.  Additionally, these data shall provide health care practitioner prescribing practices data in terms of type of facility (e.g., surgi-centers, staff model HMOs, clinics), geographic region and U.S. Census region and where possible the contractor shall provide a comparison to national figures. The patient specific population  data shall include the number and percent of patient populations of special interest to the FDA, including children (&#8804; 17 years), infants (<1 year), women of childbearing age, and elderly (&#8805; 65 years); the health care practitioner turnover rate for participation in data resource; and the demographic distribution of patients (age and gender required; race, if available). 
 The patient-specific basic data elements at the visit level shall include (but are not limited to):  patient demographics such as age (specify method by which age is obtained and how it is displayed in canned reports i.e. standard age groups, customized age groups, single years), gender and specify if other data elements are available which would include race/ethnicity; height and weight; clinical measures, i.e., blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking status; type of insurance; and geographic region.  The drug-specific basic data elements shall include generic/trade name of drug; linkage between generic and established name; strength; dosage form; new vs. continued therapy; days supply; prescriber specialty; quantity prescribed; directions for use; indication(s) for use, and source of drug (sample provided, prescription given, product administered). The diagnosis-specific basic data element shall describe the patients condition as identified by the health care practitioner during the time of the office-visit; as well as visit-specific basic data elements with the time of visit (month, year); the type of visit, e.g., first vs. subsequent visit; and the type of outpatient setting and the health care practitioner-specific basic data elements shall include the type of practitioner; specialty; age; gender; and geographic region. The data resource shall include a drug coding system that consists of drug, clinical or medical coding levels for FDA data analyses; and if available, quantify the prescribing of drug- or biologic products in the outpatient setting by healthcare professionals. For examining visit-level prescribing data for products the data resource shall link clinical or medical data on indication in detail.  For examining data on visits for specified disease or medical conditions, and associated treatments (if any), the data resource shall capture the drugs prescribed to treat the same diagnosis as well as all drugs mentioned during the visit regardless of diagnosis. In the event of changes to the Contractors business or agreements with their data suppliers, the FDA shall be notified within 5 business days of the Contractor becoming aware of such changes.  This notification shall include details of the impact of these changes on data quality, data quantity, and overall data characteristics. To protect any sensitive data which may be transmitted electronically between the data vendor and the FDA, the data vendor shall participate in the CDER secure electronic mail system. The contractor shall provide a minimum of two training sessions per year.  The Contractor shall provide a support package consisting of technical, analytical, and clinical support throughout the length of the contract.  In addition, the Contractor will be required to conduct an on-site annual meeting for the purposes of discussing product enhancements, contract performance, and FDA satisfaction with all deliverables.  Monthly usage reports detailing use of the resource by individual FDA users and type of use (if applicable) are required.
2) Technical Requirements and Capabilities.  The patient-level and/or visit-level data shall be a currently existing, commercially available, HIPAA-compliant product that shall provide immediate automated access with the capability of providing characterization of health care practitioner prescribing practices including but not limited to patient demographics, and indications for treatment in the outpatient setting. The data shall be HIPAA-compliant product that shall provide immediate automated access with the capability of providing both current and historical national-level prescribing practice information.
Access to the data shall be immediate, unlimited, direct, desktop and in real-time.  Access shall include all upgrades, enhancements, and modifications to software and data. Access shall be via secure Internet or network-based methods and shall be in a multi-user environment.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce (USDOC), National Oceanic Atmospheric and Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS) intends to solicit for purchase of 3 each, Meter, Radiation Hazard, Herley Farmingdale (General Microwave Corporation), Model Raham 3, with 481B Power Density Meter, Probe, and Carrying Case. NSN: 6625-01-095-3788; ASN: R400-SE46-1. This item is being purchased for the National Weather Service (NWS)/NEXRAD program, to be delivered to the National Logistics Support Center, Kansas City, MO. This item is used to maintain the NOAA Weather Radio transmitters. In order to gain the most benefit from the shared resources of the NWS, like support equipment must be used at all sites. Such commonality reduces procurement, calibration, training, documentation, sparing and repair costs for the following reasons: 1) A minimum of 30 of the above items have already been purchased and issued to NWS Southern Region Weather Forecast Office. The three (3) units will be used as depot spares to support the existing forecast office sites; 2) Equipment specified will be described in the published NOAA weather radio procedures. Alteration of those procedures to accommodate equipment substitutions would be costly and manpower intensive in that the manual would have to be rewritten with additional test procedures and redistributed to the 30 affected NWS forecast offices; and 3) Non-standardized equipment is more expensive to support in the NWS Consolidated Logistics Supply (CLS) system due to the costs to catalog, stock, maintain, and supply multiple items of the same type. The intended procurement is for supplies for which the Government intends to acquire under the guidelines of FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one known source under the authority of FAR 6.302. However, all proposals received within 10 calendar days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government.

<DESC><p>Period of Performance</p>
<p>December February 9, 2009 through April 3 , 2009. The duration of the contractor's performance period is based on 320 hours for this time period. The contractor shall work 40 hrs/week during the normal operating hours of the facility, which are a standard eight (8) hours per day, five (5) days per week. An alternate work schedule may be requested and approved by the NMFS Project Leader, provided the contractor's work hours do not total more than 40-hours per week. Work schedules should include working within the core hours of the Center, which are from 9:00am to 3:00pm.
<p>Scope of Work</p>
<p>The performance of these contracted activities will take place on-site at the NMFS, Southwest Fisheries Science Center and during meetings which will take place abroad. This work requires the contractor to attend meetings in Australia in February 2009.</p>
<p>The western Pacific harbors some of the last remaining leatherback nesting aggregations of significant size in the Pacific. Although there are still hundreds of turtles nesting, 75% of these occur n one area on the North coast of Papua (Indonesia) and researchers are concerned by new information indicating that the majority of nests laid are not producing hatchlings. Some community-based beach and nest protection procedures have been developed to improve hatching success, creating hope that application of these techniques now will ensure that populations are sustained in the future. The objectives of the Western Pacific Leatherback Workshop will be to bring together researchers from the region to discuss their conservation and management strategies, review existing data, standardize data collection, prioritize research and conservation goals for the region, and establish regional collaborations and partnerships so that an effective and cohesive management strategy can be developed for leatherbacks in the western Pacific. Work requires an individual that has a Ph.D. with a focus on leatherback turtles and extensive knowledge in western Pacific leatherback populations.<br /><br />The Government will provide any equipment or supplies necessary to conduct these services to the contractor at no cost.<br /><br />The NMFS project leader is responsible for the overall scheduling of the project activity and selection of communication needs. Regular meetings between the contractor and the NMFS project leader will be required to outline a work schedule and prioritize tasks. The contractor is responsible for scheduling the work to be done each day, within the work schedule of the NMFS staff. Contractor personnel are required to do the work independently, generating high quality results in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Travel is anticipated and authorized under this task order and funding has been allocated in this Statement of Work for 1 trip. Although additional travel is not anticipated, if the need arises, external funding will be used to cover any additional expenses. Funding allocated to labor may be used for travel if approved in advance by the NMFS Project Leader, but at the expense of reducing the number of available work hours. Any travel conducted prior to the receipt of proper authorization will be done at the contractor's own risk and expense.</p>
<p>Overtime is not anticipated nor authorized under this task order. However, should overtime be necessary in the performance of this order, the NMFS Project Leader shall provide prior approval and authorization of hours.</p>
<p>Work under this task order may require that personnel have access to Privacy Information. Personnel shall adhere to the Privacy Act, Title 5 of the U.S. Code, Section 552a, FAR 52.224-1, Privacy Act Notification, and FAR 52.224-2, Privacy Act. Contractor personnel are responsible for maintaining confidentiality of all subjects and materials.</p>
<p>Contractor shall have completed the suitability and security processing or be in the process of completing it within the first two (2) days of reporting to the Government's facility. Security processing as outlined in the master contract, Section C.2.</p>
<p>Deliverables<br />The deliverables of the contracted activity shall be completed in the format prescribed, by the due dates specified in the work assignments and are as follows:</p>
<p>&bull;Coordinate workshop agenda, list of participants, organize travel arrangements for invited participants, and develop presentation template for invited speakers<br />&bull;Attend and lead discussions during the workshop to be held in Brisbane, Australia February 2009<br />&bull;Compile workshop proceedings by April 3, 2009</p>

<DESC>Disability, Aging, and Long-Term Care Policy and Data Analysis


This SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE is to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) to provide the following services: (1) policy development and analysis; (2) demonstration and evaluation design; (3) program assessment and evaluation; and (4) data infrastructure development and modeling in support of disability, aging, and long-term care policy development and data analysis.  The information from this market research will help the Office of Disability, Aging, and Long-Term Care Policy (DALTCP) plan its acquisition strategy.  DALTCP is located in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE).  NAICS Code:  541618; Small Business Size Standard: $7.0 Million.

THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH. ASPE/OFFICE OF DISABILITY, AGING AND LONG-TERM CARE POLICY WILL NOT RESPOND TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS MARKET RESEARCH.

The Office of Disability, Aging, and Long-Term Care Policy is responsible for the development, coordination, research, and evaluation of U.S. Department of Health and Human Service (HHS) policies and programs that support the independence, productivity, health and security of people with disabilities, including children, working age adults, and older persons.  DALTCP is also the lead office within HHS Office of the Secretary for policy research and analysis related to international disability, aging issues, and long-term care.  Policy areas that DALTCP staff work on include: disability measurement and analysis of trends; housing, health, income supports, and education, training and employment needs of people with disabilities; population aging and aging-related services; long-term care and personal assistance services, including informal caregiving; post-acute care; palliative care; long-term rehabilitation services; linkages between the acute, post-acute and long-term care systems; long-term care quality; health information technology in long-term care; health and long-term care-related employment supports; private long-term care insurance and financing issues.  Activities in these areas routinely require policy planning, policy and budget analysis, regulatory review, formulation of legislative proposals, data development and analysis, and policy research and evaluation.
Potential contractors will provide expertise in policy development and analysis; demonstration and evaluation design; program assessment and evaluation; and data infrastructure development and modeling.  In conjunction with these services, contractors will provide organizational and logistical support for conferences, meetings, and other events to assist in the development and dissemination of the deliverables produced under this ID/IQ.  Logistical support may entail making travel arrangements, securing hotel accommodations and meeting space, editing and report formatting, and providing technical expertise in support of conferences (e.g., agenda setting, recruitment of expert presenters, and preparation of conference papers and materials).  Below is a short description of the required expertise.

Policy Development and Analysis: Contractors will undertake development and analysis of disability, aging, and long-term care policy options currently under consideration and/or likely to be considered in the future.  Information produced by these efforts is expected to contribute to internal debate on budgetary, legislative, and program modification decisions; provide background analysis and support for major administration initiatives; support short- and long-range strategic planning; and, occasionally, produce the information base for Congressionally-mandated reports.  Policy development and analysis activities will produce a wide-range of deliverables.  These include: issue and discussion papers summarizing the state of knowledge on a given topic; memorandum and spreadsheets that succinctly summarize the findings from a specific policy analysis (e.g., estimated changes in coverage, cost, and impact of specific policy options); memorandum and reports identifying significant gaps in current knowledge or program effectiveness; options papers identifying the strengths and weaknesses of proposed policy initiatives or changes in disability, aging, and long-term care programs; and formal briefings for high level policy officials.  Because these products are intended for a wide audience within HHS, including technical analysts and high-level policymakers, written material and briefings need to be presented clearly and concisely.

Demonstration and Evaluation Design: Contractors will design demonstrations and evaluations of disability, aging, and long-term care programs and policy options.  The goal of demonstrations and evaluations is to understand how modifications to existing programs or entirely new approaches impact service delivery, outcomes, and costs.  Demonstration/evaluation design will frequently be iterative, requiring contractors to produce a general design with options before developing a more fully elaborated approach.  As a result, contractors will frequently undertake background or preliminary work as well as formal demonstration/evaluation design.  Background information will be used by program managers and policymakers to determine the feasibility and basic parameters of a design prior to full-scale development.  Examples of this type of preliminary work include literature reviews, the development of issue/concept papers, primary data collection activity of limited scope, microsimulations, and secondary data analysis and tasks related to the preparation of data for analysis.  Formal demonstration/evaluation design will develop specific components or the entire approach for determining the implications of changes to disability, aging, and long-term care programs and/or policy.  As part of this process, contractors may be required to convene a Technical Expert Panel and/or a Federal Advisory Panel to get feedback on proposed approaches.

Program Assessment and Evaluation: Contractors will conduct program assessments and evaluations of disability, aging, and long-term care programs and policies.  Program assessments and evaluations will be used to determine the effectiveness of current programs and the impact of proposed changes and/or new approaches.  Program assessments may identify best practices in program sites, produce preliminary data on efficiency and effectiveness and recommend options for program change or subsequent evaluation.  They may also involve in-depth case studies, descriptive field work on policy implementation, and limited data collection to increase our understanding of programs or service arrays in particular states or communities.  Formal evaluations will typically require more extensive data collectionfrequently national in scopethrough the of computer assisted interviewing software (e.g., CAPI or CATI), and analysis to determine the impact of changes to programs and policy.

Data Infrastructure Development and Modeling: Contractors will provide expertise to develop and improve the Departments data infrastructure and modeling capabilities to determine trends in the use of disability, aging, and long-term care programs and services; determine the impact of policy changes, particularly those affecting the well being of children and working-age adults with chronic illness and disability, and the older population in general; and estimate costs of policy options and initiatives.  Contractors will identify, develop, and prepare analytic files to support development of demographic and microsimulation models and policy analysis using national and local surveys as well as HHS administrative data.  Work may include constructing analytic files, editing and manipulating data elements, and linking multiple data files to undertake cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses to determine how people are affected by broad changes in disability, aging, and long-term care policy.  Estimating the net influence of major trends (e.g., changes in health and disability, changes in consumer preferences, mortality declines, etc.), some which may be interrelated may be a critical activity.  In determining the impact of these trends, analyses of secondary data (e.g., national surveys and administrative data) may be required, as well as the collection of new data, to add to the capabilities of existing models and to improve estimates.  Model development and policy analysis may involve merging survey data with administrative data (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid claims, enrollment records, Social Security payment and disability records, OASIS and MDS data, etc.) or the use of administrative data exclusively.

<DESC>1. The U.S. Army Engineering Support Center, Huntsville, Alabama (CEHNC) is seeking sources for potential contracts to provide support for the CEHNC Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) program to provide recurring maintenance (quarterly, semi-annual, and annual) and minor repair services to include the repair and replacement of petroleum equipment and maintenance related construction services at Government petroleum facilities in the continental United States (CONUS).<BR><BR>2. The contractor will properly maintain and repair federally funded petroleum systems and other facilities located at the Garrisons and military installations in order to provide compliance with code, criteria, and regulations.  Petroleum system means an underground or aboveground storage tank, connected piping, ancillary equipment and appurtenances, and containment system, if any.  The contractor shall provide all labor, supervision, transportation, supplies, vehicles, tools, materials, facilities, equipment, and incidentals necessary to conduct inspections, preventive maintenance, unscheduled/corrective maintenance, minor repair, and minor construction on the petroleum systems.  Contractor shall be required to maintain petroleum systems, equipment, and accessories to operate reliably and satisfactorily.  Maintenance tasks are primarily funded by DESC in accordance with the DOD regulation 4140.25-M chapter 8.  Preventive maintenance tasks will be defined as recurrent, periodic or scheduled work to preserve a facility by preventing its deterioration.  Unscheduled/Corrective maintenance will also be required under this contract and will be defined as necessary, not already scheduled (or preventive) maintenance, in order to address and correct a facility defect for the preservation of the facility.  Other maintenance may be ordered by the Garrisons for non-petroleum systems such as for separators, piping, tanks, sewers, storm drains.  Minor Repair will be defined as the restoration of a real property to such a condition that it may effectively be utilized for its designated purpose by overhaul, reprocessing or replacement of constituent parts or materials that have deteriorated by action or elements or usage and that have not been corrected through maintenance.  Periodic testing of systems/components, generally on a quarterly basis, is included within the DESC definitions of maintenance and repair. Other repair may be ordered by the Garrisons for non-petroleum systems such as for separators, piping, tanks, sewers, storm drains, or requirements to meet compliance with applicable laws and regulations.<BR><BR>3. CEHNC intends to solicit and award multiple Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts (one base-year with four, one-year option periods) for the DESC program. It is the Governments intent to consider awarding a portion of this acquisition under the Small Business set-aside program per FAR Part 19. As a result, the Government is performing market research in order to determine if small businesses possess the capability to execute some or all of the requirements of this anticipated request for proposal (RFP). During the first year of the contract, the plan is to provide recurring maintenance and repair services for petroleum facilities at 33 Army installations, Army Reserves and Army National Guard facility locations in CONUS.  The majority of these installations are collocated in the Southeast region (see attached site list).   In future years, the intention is to extend these services, on a regional basis (i.e. Northeast, Northwest, and Southwest), to Army installations, Army Reserves and Army National Guard facility locations throughout CONUS.  A site-list of performance locations will be provided upon request. Please email the request to: lanita.mcgraw-holloway@usace.army.mil <BR><BR>4. The most applicable North American Industrial Classification System Codes (NAICS) for this type of acquisition are:  562910 (Remediation Services) and 424710 (Petroleum Bulk Stations and Terminals).<BR><BR>5. Interested small business vendors who are capable of meeting the requirements identified in this notice are requested to reply to this email with a response to the questions presented below. If there is no experience or capability associated with a particular question, so indicate.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT MS Floria Jones, (706) 787-2094, floria.jones@us.army.mil  A.	General Information.<BR><BR>     The Southeast Region (TRBO Reg. 3 & 4), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 46 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and affiliated MTFs in the countries of Honduras and Cuba, and the territory of Puerto Rico announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of VAGINAL SPECULA. <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Southeast Region include, but are not limited to Eisenhower Army Medical Center (FT Gordon, GA), Winn Army Community Hospital (FT Stewart, GA), Martin Army Community Hospital (FT Benning, GA), Naval Hospital Jacksonville (NAS Jacksonville, FL), 96th Medical Group (Eglin AFB, FL), Naval Hospital Pensacola (Pensacola, FL), Naval Hospital Beaufort (Beaufort, SC), 81st Medical Group (Keesler AFB, MS) and the 6th Medical Group (MacDill AFB, FL).  <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company MUST have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement the Prime Vendor Program.  The RFQ will not result in a contract award.   For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.)  Anticipated selection date is May 2009.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.    <BR><BR>Point of Contact:  Floria Jones, (706) 787-2094, floria.jones@us.army.mil.<BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR><BR>The Southeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of VAGINAL SPECULA, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $179,363.61.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.<BR><BR>At the request of the Southeast Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to floria.jones@us.army.mil.  Submissions must be received by COB 5:00 PM EST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region should be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southeast Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.<BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to (floria.jones@us.army.mil) by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified / invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor.  <BR>In general, acceptability for the purposes of validation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and /or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products and services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.  NOTE:  Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR>1.	Vendor MUST provide a complete line of Vaginal Specula products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  The ability for the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure by them to do so will result in the vendor not being included in this standardization effort.  <BR>a.	At a minimum this includes Disposable Vaginal Specula with and without integrated sheath; available in a range of sizes (small, medium, large), blade sizes to accommodate adolescents and geriatrics; and adjustable with locking mechanism.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes.<BR>b.	Vendor MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (manufactured and/or distributed by brands) via catalog, and product literature in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and device type.  (Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I).<BR>2.	Vendor MUST have a DAPA for the Vaginal Specula product line.  Vendor MUST provide DAPA number with initial submittal.  (Note that vendors without a DAPA number will be disqualified in Phase I).  <BR>3.	Vendor MUST have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, the prime vendor is Owens & Minor) for Vaginal Specula in the Southeast Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified in Phase I.)  Vendor MUST provide supporting documentation (four digit code) of agreement with Prime Vendor with initial submittal. <BR>4.	Vendor MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase II will be disqualified.<BR>5.	Vendor MUST provide all history of back orders and recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for Vaginal Specula products, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recall during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any provided points of contact in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question. <BR>6.	Vendor MUST provided Vaginal Specula that are available in individual packaging.<BR>7.	Vendor MUST provide latex safe/free products.  Vendor must provide list of all latex safe/free items supplied (catalog, etc.) in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.<BR><BR>Phase II Plan  Clinical/Performance Evaluations and Pricing Analysis Process:<BR>Clinical/Performance Evaluations<BR>1.	Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent directly to the TRBO point of contact and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the TRBO location by COB, 5:00 PM EST, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  Note: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor and final delivery date of the product sample sets.  <BR>2.	Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical/patient care setting using a Likert scale, with a one to five scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable, and five (5)-highly acceptable.<BR>3.	All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for twenty-one (21) calendar days.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP approval).<BR>4.	To determine acceptability, the CPT, comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines from the Southeast Region will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below in a clinical/patient care setting.  <BR>5.	Specific Rules of Engagement for this standardization initiative:  A. Vendors will ONLY provide sample products of the items that are requested and being evaluated.   Vendors that bring in other product samples or literature on items that are not part of the evaluation process will be disqualified from the evaluation process.  B.  Vendors presence will not be required for in-servicing prior to or during the evaluations.  C.  Vendors WILL NOT be allowed to be present during the actual evaluation process of their products OR THEIR COMPETITORS PRODUCTS.  D.  Vendors will not be allowed to speak to any hospital staff member regarding the product evaluation, product pricing or pricerelated factors.  Vendors that speak to hospital staff members regarding the product evaluation, pricing or price related factor will be disqualified from this evaluation process.  <BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:         <BR>1.	(Patient Safety Goal 7 - Reduce the risk of health care associated infections) Disposable vaginal speculum has a smooth molded design.<BR>a.	Vaginal speculum must have a comfortable surface without sharp edges that can injury vaginal tissue.<BR>b.	The evaluator will visually inspect speculum for uneven areas.<BR>2.	(Patient Safety Goal 7 - Reduce the risk of health care associated infections)  Disposable vaginal speculum is durable/resist cracking or breaking.<BR>a. Vaginal speculum must be constructed of material that ensures exceptional strength to provide safety for safety for patient and user.<BR> b. Evaluator will visually inspect speculum for signs of cracking or breakage before, during and after usage.<BR>3.	(Patient Safety Goal 16 - Improve recognition and response to changes in a patients condition)     Disposable vaginal speculum transparent blades are clear for full visibility of the tissue in the exam area.<BR>a.	Vaginal Speculum blades must be transparent to allow full visibility of vaginal tissue or cervix.<BR>b.	While examining the patient, the evaluator will assess the speculum blades ability to allow visibility of area being examined.  <BR>4. (Patient Safety Goal 16 - Improve recognition and response to change in patient condition)    Speculum locking mechanism maintains device in desired exam position.<BR>a.	Speculum locking mechanism must stay in the open position during examination procedure to allow for faster accurate results.<BR>b.	The evaluator will lock the device in desired position and assess whether device maintains the set position throughout the exam.<BR><BR>Pricing Analysis Process.  Upon completion of the Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are found technical acceptable will be qualified/invited to provide their product samples and price discount quotes concurrently.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Southeast Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by COB 5:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). <BR>     The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above.  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR>    Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region.  (Post-Standardization- Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing. (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs. (3) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  (4) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 09 FEBRUARY 2009 5:PM EST.<BR>

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture - Animal Plant and Health Inspection Service (APHIS) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to McClure Company under the authority of FAR 6.302 for the following requirement:  factory authorized services to inspect, test, adjust, and perform maintence on the NPGQC building automation system.

The NPGQCs building automation system is a proprietary control system manufactured by American Auto-Matrix. The service needs to be performed by a trained and certified Auto-Matrix specialist.  McClure Company has been the factory authorized American Auto-Matrix brand automatic temperature control (ATC) systems provider for USDA since April of 2001.  Auto-Matrix has divisional territories that prevent dealers of their product from competing against one another.  As a result, McClure Company has been the only authorized Solutions Integrator (dealer) working on NPGQCs Auto-Matrix building automation systems BAS) for the past 7 year.   Because McClure is the authorized dealer, it is not possible to use another company to service the Auto-Matrix product.  The circuitry within the smart panels located throughout the facility is software driven.  The database created and programmed by McClure Company is not fully compatible with other building control systems manufacturers such as Siemens or Honeywell.  A Siemens chiller controller or boiler sequencing program is not compatible with the Auto-Matrix system and would not function.  At this time there are no common software protocols between building automation systems which would allow for the competitive pricing.  As a result, any new or replacement component to the building automation system must be American Auto-Matrix.  Lastly, an authorized Auto-Matrix technician is needed in order to not void any warranties that are associated with the building automation system.  

Interested sources that are capable of providing the equivalent service listed above are encouraged to submit statements of capability to this contracting office.  Small business concerns are encouraged to participate.  This is not a request for competitive proposals, but instead a market research method to determine interested sources.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive (i.e., non-brand name) procurement.  No requests for capability briefings will be honored as a result of this notice.  Interested sources who submit data are responsible for appropriately marking information if it is proprietary in nature.  Please provide past performance and references regarding your ability to provide this service along with your Statement of Capability.  The Government will not award a contract based on the information received, nor reimburse participants for information they provide.  Information provided is strictly voluntary.  Please e-mail Statements of Capability to Leigh Eberhart, Leigh.D.Eberhart@aphis.usda.gov  Telephonic inquiries will not be honored.  Closing date for submission of Statement of Capability is January 20, 2009 at 1:00 P.M. CST.

Venue: 	Global Learning Portal (GLP) (http://www.glp.net )

Dates: 	January 26 - February 13, 2009


Background:  USAID has initiated a major exercise to review and update the sector strategy and operational guidelines for assistance in Education.  The new strategy will address trends, issues, and opportunities in three subsectors -- basic education, higher education, and workforce development, as well as the conceptual and programmatic linkages among these sub-sectors. The strategy exercise is composed of four phases: research and discussion; subsector strategy development; sector strategy development; and publication and dissemination. 

Purpose of Online Discussions: As part of phase one, the USAID strategy team is developing a series of papers which address the context for education, lessons learned in providing assistance, and salient issues impacting progress in the sector. USAID seeks your expertise and experience in reflecting on questions emanating from this research. In turn, the results of the online deliberations will serve as the groundwork for developing the various pieces of the education strategy.   

Next Steps: USAID will engage in a series of online discussion forums, moderated by the authors of the strategy series.  Attached is a series schedule; once introduced, a topic will remain open for the duration of the two-week discussion period.  The instruction to register and get onto GLP is attached.  The website will be available January 23 for you to register and obtain documents.   We encourage all USAID partners / staff to contribute to these discussions in order to better inform our strategic planning process.  Please take a minute to invite relevant staff in your organization and schedule their involvement in these discussions.

1.  BACKGROUND
The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) seeks interested parties to propose innovative manufacturing technology and industrial base projects under the Industrial Base Innovation Fund Program (IBIF).  The Congressional Report 110-335 directs that the highest priority on investments be made in areas that support accelerating the surge production of items likely to be required in near-term military operations and in areas to preserve or expand diminishing critical defense industrial base, (see http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_reports&docid=f:sr335.110.pdf  page 266).  The Defense Logistics Agency is acting on behalf of the Department of Defense in executing the IBIF.  Accordingly, all proposers are encouraged to submit proposals that will meet Congressional Direction.  The scope of the IBIF program includes all of the manufacturing technologies supporting the Aviation, Maritime, Land and Troop Support Supply Chains.  The goal of the IBIF program is to implement significant manufacturing technology improvements into these supply chains.  Subject to availability of funds, a total Government investment of about $10 million during Fiscal Year 2009 is planned to fund IBIF projects under this BAA.  The expected cost range for proposals submitted under this BAA is up to $1,000,000 with a period of performance of up to 12 months.  The desirable outcome of a completed project is an advanced manufacturing capability that is implemented in the industrial base and supporting one or more current systems or troop support items.  Contracts awarded under this proposal will be cost type contracts.   FAR 16.301-3 states that a cost-reimbursement contract may be used only when the contractor's accounting system is adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract.  Offerors must submit documentation showing that they do have adequate accounting systems.  Proposals without this documentation will not be evaluated.

The vision for the MANTECH Program is to enable a responsive, world-class manufacturing capability to affordably meet the warfighters' needs throughout the defense system life-cycle.  The MANTECH Program matures and validates emerging manufacturing technologies to support low-risk implementation in industry and DoD facilities, e.g., depots and shipyards.  The Program addresses production issues from system development through transition to production and sustainment.  Investments are driven by defense-essential needs.  The Program focuses on manufacturing-related needs that exist across industry sectors and throughout the product life-cycle.  The primary benefit to the industrial base comes from the emphasis on transfer of the technologies from the initial demonstration application to the rest of industry.  

The IBIF program is focusing on the Production and Sustainment phases of the Development life cycle.  The emphasis is on rapid, low-cost, high-quality manufacturing; efficient factory operations and supplier interactions; the decoupling of unit cost from production volume; improving surge capability for near-term military operations and in areas to preserve or expand diminishing critical defense industrial base; and reduction of foreign source dependence for critical defense Materiel.  In the support and sustainment phase, the concentration is on efficient manufacturing and maintenance processes, rapid, low-cost spares, and replacement parts acquisition.  

2.  GENERAL PROPOSAL SUBMISSION INFORMATION

Proposers must submit an original and eight (8) copies of full proposals and an electronic copy on a CD-ROM referring to BAA 0003-09 by 3:00 PM, local Philadelphia time on or before 16 March 2009 to the Point of Contact listed above in order to be considered.  No additional information is available, nor shall a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  Requests for same shall be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some or none of the proposals received.  This is an unrestricted acquisition.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DLA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA shall be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in this technology.  Large Business concerns are required to submit a Small Business/Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan.  For purposes of this acquisition, the size standard is 500 employees Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 3462.  All correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including request for information on how to submit a proposal to this BAA, should be directed to the POC at the top of the BAA; e-mail is preferred.  Proposals may NOT be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent shall be disregarded.  

3.  TECHNICAL AREAS OF INTEREST

The primary focus of IBIF is the industrial base.  The areas of interest align with the DOD supply chains: Aviation, Land, Maritime, and Troop Support.  Supply chains are not directly correlated to a Military Service (Army, Navy and Air Force).  For example, all missiles are included in the Aviation supply chain.  If there is a missile related proposal, it should identify the specific missile/weapon system and the proposals position in the supply chain (prime, subcontractor, etc) to implement the IBIF proposal results.  The Troop Support Supply Chain includes Clothing and Textile Products (e.g.  Uniforms, Body Armor etc.), Combat Rations (e.g.  Meals-Ready-to-Eat, Unitized Group Ration, etc.), Construction and Equipment (e.g. Barrier material), and Medical.  

The technology thrusts of interest are Metals, Composites, and Electronics.  The highest priority will be placed on investments made in areas that support accelerating the surge production of items likely to be required in near-term military operations and in areas to preserve or expand diminishing critical defense industrial base.  At lower tiers of the industrial base, it is understood that manufacturing technologies may cut across these Supply Chains or technologies, however, each offeror should clearly have identified a target application that will implement the proposed technology.  Proposals without a clearly identified target application will not be considered for award.  All manufacturing processes and systems are eligible for consideration, including but not limited to, new/alternative materials; faster, higher quality unit processes; reduction in process variation through advanced process control systems; tighter coupling of the supply chain through advanced information technology; establishing a reliable domestic capability to alleviate dependence on an unreliable foreign source; and implementing dual use (equally capable for civil and military applications) manufacturing capability to be available to DOD during time when a surge in production is needed; support accelerating the surge capabilities of items likely to be required in near-term military operations and in areas to preserve or expand diminishing critical defense industrial base or eliminate foreign source dependence.  .  Equal consideration will be given to all approaches that support accelerating the surge production of items likely to be required in near-term military operations and in areas to preserve or expand diminishing critical defense industrial base.  

4.  EVALUATION CRITERIA

<DESC>This proposed procurement is a follow-on of a portfolio management applicationessential to the execution and performance measurement phase of the Office of Educationsportfolio management process and the related support services. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with Expert Choicefor maintenance and support of the Periscope software package.	This software alignsprogrammatic decisions with Organizational objectives/criteria; implement a structured,repeatable and justifiable decision making approach; leverage organizational expertise;improve top-down and bottom-up communication; develop consensus and buy-in amongstakeholders; and create in organizational decisions. In November of 2006, the NASA Office of Education executed a task order under an existingGSA contract to acquire software and related services from Expert Choice. The purpose ofthe software acquisition was to equip NASA with software that would enable the Office ofEducation to meet requirements set by the NASA Administrator and the Office of Managementand Budget. The goal was to restructure agency-wide the management and implementation ofthe entire NASA Education Program. Expert Choice has previously worked closely with NASA Education in the implementation ofExpert Choice (the softwarethe companys standard prioritization/selection product) toprioritize the 450 projects in the NASA education portfolio, and align them with NASAeducation outcomes and objectives. Now that the Prioritization and alignment have beenaccomplished the next step in the process is to be able to measure and mange projectperformance. The companys Periscope software package provides one centralized interfaceto measure and manage organization/project portfolio performance. Periscope is a software package that provides performance management monitoringcapabilities for all projects in the NASA education portfolio. Periscope is a module tobe added to the existing performance measurement system which NASA purchased in 2006. Noother software product will work with the existing system, which is proprietary to ExpertChoice. The software will allow the Office of Education to have a single entry point forretrieving information on project schedules, benchmarks, key decisional points, relevanceand cost for each of the projects. Periscope will also allow the Office of Education tomove to the consolidation phase of its performance measurement process as required by theOffice of Management and Budget (OBM) and the Office of the NASA Administrator. NASA/HQ intends to mod an existing purchase order for maintenance and technical supportof Periscope software through 3/2010 with Expert Choice. The authority is FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A) only one responsible source. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organization may submit their capabilities and qualification to perform theeffort in writing by FAX or E-Mail, to identified point of contact not later than 3:00p.m., local time on 21 January 2009.Such capabilities/qualification will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determiningwhether or not to be conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination bythe Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis,based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>Stoller-Navarro Joint Venture (SNJV) as a Prime Contractor to the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Nuclear Security Administration, Nevada Site Office (NNSA/NSO) is seeking support services to provide accurate quantitative petrographic analyses support.  SNJV is soliciting proposals from qualified subcontractors.  The contract will be for a base period of May 1, 2009 through September 30, 2009, with three, one-year option periods beginning October 1, 2009 through September 30, 2012.

Location of Sample Area:
The NTS is located approximately 65-miles northwest of Las Vegas, NV.  Samples will be taken from the Western Pahute Mesa and Timber Mountain areas located within the NTS and the Nellis Test and Training Range, approximately 60 miles northwest of Mercury, NV (base camp).  

Description of Work:
Provide geologic and geochemical technical services and expertise to compile, organize, evaluate and document existing NTS x-ray diffraction mineralogical data for inclusion into the Southwestern Nevada Volcanic Field (SWNVF) database. 

Provide accurate petrographic analysis of rock samples produced by Phase II drilling for Pahute Mesa.  Preparation and initial petrographic analysis of typically 25  35 samples per drill hole will be required. Samples to be analyzed will be taken by on-site UGTA geologists.  Detailed petrographic analyses are to be performed on a subset of the initial samples as needed.  Limited consideration and comparison of XRD and XRF analyses of analogous samples in the analysis is expected.  It is estimated that there will be 10 drill holes.  

The purpose of these analyses is to identify the stratigraphic units these boreholes penetrate in relation to previously defined stratigraphy of the southwest Nevada volcanic field.  This is likely to require identifying hydrothermally altered mineral assemblages.  Full reporting of results is required including annotated photomaps prepared according to U. S.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
Commandant (CG-9131)
1900 Half Street, S.W. (JR11-0203)
Washington, DC 20593
Telephone: (202) 372-3692
Fax: (202) 475-3904
Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 23 January 2009, 4:00 p.m., EST. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency. Anticipated award date is on or about 26 January 2009. Contact Dennis Gaines at 252-335-6713 or Dennis.M.Gaines@uscg.mil for questions regarding this solicitation.

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<p>1)&nbsp; What lengths do you want the duct to ship (this will impact the cost of shipment)?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; REPLY:&nbsp; <em>Considering ease of installation, duct in 10 feet lengths would be good.</em></p>
<p>2)&nbsp; Do you want the duct and fittings flanged or have compression couplings?&nbsp;&nbsp; REPLY:&nbsp; <em>We do not want flanges.&nbsp; We are not sure what is meant by compression fittings.&nbsp; We want sleeves (couplings) which would be inserted into ducting.</em></p>
<p>3)&nbsp; If flanged, do you want Stainless Steel Flanges?&nbsp; REPLY:&nbsp; <em>We do not want flanges.</em></p>
<p>4)&nbsp; If compression couplings, then you will need more than 2 ea. per duct size.&nbsp;&nbsp; REPLY:&nbsp; <em>Ultimately, we could use 18 of the eight-inch sleeves (couplings for eight-inch duct) and 20 of the twelve-inch sleeves (couplings for twelve-inch duct).</em></p>

<DESC><p>FOLLOWING ARE COMMENTS FROM A VENDOR WITH RESPONSE IN ITALICS:</p>
<p>Under paragraph 1.4 of the SOW for Solicitation Number : 464-09MR-1957, you stated that the A&amp;CC expects durable and corrosion-resistant duct but paragraph 1.8 states that the A&amp;CC expects 16 gauge, 304 stainless steel. The A&amp;CC is taking responsibility for the useful life of the ductwork .Your materials of construction will be a function of your production of combustion and the physical properties of said products. For example, 304 SS and Aluminum are not the right materials of construction if the products of combustion contain chlorides. Your document states that the emissions can contain thick black smoke and 304 SS and aluminum will have a short useful life in this application.</p>
<p>RESPONSE:&nbsp; <em>We are aware of the effect of halides on 304 stainless steel. </em></p>
<p><em>The A&amp;CC will take responsibility for the useful life of the 16 gauge, 304 stainless steel ductwork</em></p>
<p><em>Our experience is that with 16 gauge stainless steel the rate of corrosion all-the-way-through our apparatus is slow.</em></p>
<p><em>If a vendor can offer a more halide resistant alloy (Haselloy, etc.) at a competitive price, we could considerer it. </em></p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions received in response to the original synopsis solicitation.  There is no change to the original response due date.<BR><BR>The following questions and answers are provided:<BR><BR>QUESTION 1:  How many frames are required for the camera in this solicitation?<BR><BR>ANSWER 1:  The Government needs at least 16 images with at least 1000x1000 pixel resolution with at least 200 million frames per second and interframe time not to exceed 5nsec.<BR><BR>QUESTION 2:  Camera questions: What is the application? Please provide a brief description. What is the velocity of the object travelling and duration of time to image this event? How fast is the object of interest traveling that would realistically require 200 million frames per second? Is the actual requirement for 16 images at 200 million frames per second - which means 16 images with a 5nsec interframe time between images? If not, please clarify what is the minimum number of images required at 200 million frames per second.  Reasoning: Our review of the requirements as stated, (re: 16 images with framing rates up to 200 million frames per second and 5ns exposure times) does not seem to be attainable based on the physics of intensified systems. The P46 phosphor requires a minimum decay time of 500ns otherwise ghosting will occur between paired double shot images.  And 500ns/8 channels = 62.5ns for eight images, which would provide 16 million fps.  The fact is to achieve 16 frames with a framing rate of 200 million frames per second would require a camera with 16 individual CCD's or channels, resulting in major issues regarding light sensitivity and vignetting.<BR><BR>ANSWER 2: The Government is looking at shock waves and cracks as they propagate through materials and needs at least 16 images with at least 1000x1000 pixel resolution with at least 200 million frames per second and interframe time not to exceed 5nsec.<BR><BR>QUESTION 3:  High Intensity Controlled Light Source Questions: Please provide an idea of energy required per pulse.  Please provide an idea of timing, re: the duration of the pulse. What is the distance from the camera to the object of interest?<BR><BR>ANSWER 3: Light source is being sought for less demanding applications. Energy should be at least 1300 J per pulse with adjustable timing and capable of imaging events less than 10 milliseconds.  The distance is 2-10 feet from camera to the object of interest.   <BR><BR>QUESTION 4:  The requirements state the camera should not exceed 25 inches x 25 inches x 25 inches and 70 lbs. weight.   Are these physical requirements based on limitations of the actual imaging environment, or would the end-user accept other dimensions in exchange for higher quality images with more contrast?<BR><BR>ANSWER 4: The camera must fit within a 25 inch x 25 inch x 25 inch cube and weigh no more than 70 lbs.  70 lbs is the OSHA maximum weight that a person can safety lift unaided.  <BR>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: - Technical- Past Performance  Price Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (End of clause) ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2  EVALUATION  COMMERCIAL ITEMS  FAR 52.212-2 is hereby amended to reflect the changes shown below as to the specific paragraph revised. ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-2 Addendum to FAR 52.212-2  Evaluation  Commercial Items. The Government will evaluate each proposal strictly in accordance with its contents.  A proposal that is unrealistic in terms of technical quality or price will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the contractual requirements.  Such proposals may be determined unacceptable.     After review of initial proposals by the contracting officer, we will conduct an in-depth evaluation of the offerors technical proposal.  Prior to being considered for award, an offeror shall fully demonstrate that it possesses the capabilities which the Government has determined essential to the reliable, efficient and timely accomplishment of the required services.   Award will be made using the lowest-price, technically-acceptable source selection process.  Award will be made to the offeror that presents the proposal that possesses all of the following characteristics:   (1) meets the acceptability standards for non-price factors, (2) conforms to the solicitation, (3) determined acceptable to the Government, (4) is from a responsible (as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 9) offeror, and (5) has the lowest price of those offerors meeting the first four characteristics listed here.        Technical acceptability will be determined through an evaluation of the offerors discussion of technical factors in their proposal.  In addition, offerors must demonstrate the extent of their capacity to provide services.  This will be determined by evaluating the offerors past performance .    Except for communications conducted for the purpose of minor clarification, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions.  Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a technical and price standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if it is later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.   Evaluation Factors.  The following factors will be evaluated:  Factor 1:  Ability to supply drugs required with 30 days after delivery order.  Factor 2:  Provide Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) ;  Factor  3:  Past Performance  Factor  4:  Price. Note: Offerors must meet the experience requirement as outlined in Addendum to FAR 52.212-1.  Proposals that do not meet the mandatory experience requirement will not be considered further for award.  Factors 1, 2.  Technical Merit.  Technical merit ratings reflect the Governments confidence in each offerors ability, as demonstrated in its proposal, to perform the requirements stated in the solicitation.  In evaluating the proposal risk, the Government will make an independent judgment of the probability of success, the impact of failure and the alternatives available to meet the requirements.  The offerors Technical Proposal consists of written documentation (Factors 1 through 2).  The following adjectival ratings will be used in evaluating each offerors technical proposal.   " Acceptable  To receive this rating, the offeror shall present a proposal that clearly and comprehensively addresses each of the factors and its subfactors, if applicable.  The offeror shall provide sufficient details for the Government to determine whether the proposal satisfactorily meets the minimum requirements of the Performance Work Statement and this solicitation.  The proposal shall clearly demonstrate that the offeror fully understands and is capable of performing the requirement for the total proposed price indicated in its proposal.   " Unacceptable  An unacceptable rating will be assessed on any offeror that presents a proposal that demonstrates any of the following:  1. Fails to clearly and comprehensively address each of the factors . 2.Fails to provide sufficient detail for the Government to determine whether the proposal satisfactorily meets the minimum requirements of the Performance Work Statement and this solicitation in addressing the factors. 3.	Fails to clearly demonstrate that the offeror fully understands and is technically capable to perform the requirements at its total proposed price.  Note:  To receive consideration for award, a rating of acceptable must be achieved in all technical factors.  Factor 3.  Past Performance.   Performance Risk analysis provides insight into an offeror's probability of successfully completing the solicitation requirements based on the offeror's performance record on recent, relevant, and similar contract efforts.  The number and severity of problems (if any), the demonstrated effectiveness of corrective actions taken (if required) and the overall performance record are to be taken into consideration.  The following risk ratings will be used to evaluate past and present performance: "Favorable  Based on the offerors past performance record, the Government has essentially no doubt that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. "Unfavorable  Based on the offerors past and present performance record, the Government has significant doubt that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. "Neutral/Unknown Risk  No relevant performance record is identifiable upon which to base a meaningful performance risk prediction.  A thorough search was unable to identify any relevant past and present performance information for the offeror or key team members/subcontractors or their key personnel.  This is neither a negative nor a positive assessment.     Evaluation of past performance will be subjective based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  The currency, content, general trends, and relevance of the information in contractor's performance will be considered.  Providing incorrect references and phone numbers may render your proposal as unacceptable.      The government may also consider and use any additional information from its own files, databases such as the Past Performance Information Retrieval System, references provided by the offeror, or from any source it deems appropriate.  The Government may survey references to verify information provided and may survey other sources known to the Government.     If adverse past performance information is obtained, the respective point of contact will be contacted to obtain additional information about the circumstances surrounding the situation.  Offerors will be given an opportunity to address unfavorable reports of past performance to which the offeror has not had a previous opportunity to respond. The offeror's response, or lack thereof, will be taken into consideration.  If an offeror does not have a past and performance history relating to the solicitation, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably, and a neutral rating will be given for this factor.     Note:  Any offeror that receives a rating of unfavorable in past performance will not be considered. Factor 4.  Price.  Price analysis techniques will be used to evaluate an offerors proposal, but will not be scored.  Pricing will be evaluated for realism and the extent to which it is fair and reasonable in terms of the Governments requirements.  The Government is interested in proposals that meet the requirements with acceptable risk, at a fair and reasonable price.  The submitted financial statements and/or evidence of a line of credit will be reviewed by Defense Contract Audit Agency financial liaison advisors and the contracting officer to assist in determining offeror responsibility.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC><p>Background</p>
<p>The 808th Armament Systems Group (808 ARSG), 687th Armament Systems Squadron (687 ARSS) contracts with private industry for lethal and non-lethal armament and directed energy technologies.</p>
<p>687 ARSS uses service contractors in fulfilling its mission requirements, including the review of the white paper proposals solicited in this BAA. Service contracts contain an organizational "conflict of interest" clause that requires service contractors to protect the data, and prohibits them from using the data for any other purpose than for which it was presented.</p>
<p>In accordance with AFMCFARS 5327.9001, the Foreign Disclosure Office has determined foreign participation is not authorized.</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory and Electronic Systems Center have matured active denial technology over several years. The result brought forth a working technology demonstrator via the Active Denial Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) that completed in September 2007. To arrive at a practical, field-able system design, 808ARSG/687ARSS is leading a Bridge Effort between the end of the ACTD and entering the formal acquisition process as defined in accordance with DoD 5000 series directives and instructions.</p>
<p>687ARSS is currently pursuing acquisition of Active Denial System (ADS) weapon systems by starting a pre-MS B (Pre-EMD) efforts in FY12 with an anticipated competitive two-contractor, award thru Critical <br />Design Review (CDR). This would be followed by a MS B decision and down-select to one contractor to develop and produce a mobile ADS (MADS), initial production is estimated at 20 systems. This is intended as a DoD joint-service (Army, Navy, Air Force) effort, but there is potential for additional production from DoD and other Government agencies.</p>
<p>The intent of this BAA is to address, by way of a study contract, risk reduction for developing a MADS without extensive human effects trials. While there may be reference to and knowledge of versions of the active denial system design currently under test and/or under consideration for deployment, the use of the term "system" in the context of the phrase "active denial system", "Active Denial System", or "ADS" is not intended to represent a particular system designation or system of record. A final material solution to an operational requirement is not within the scope of this work.</p>

<p>While the anticipated contract type for this award is Firm Fixed Price, the Government reserves the right to award other contract types or assistance instruments in lieu of contracts, which may require awardees to have an approved accounting system.</p>
<p>The general scope for a contract resulting from this BAA is a limited research program, generally a feasibility study. The program should be designed to demonstrate well defined and substantive research results, should not be overly ambitious or open-ended, and should not require a substantial testing effort to provide assurance of results. Nonetheless, any testing that will be required should be identified and described.</p>
<p>Statement of Objectives</p>
<p>The objectives of this BAA are to evaluate risk, evaluate technology maturity, and to stimulate industry interest to eventually foster competition for acquisition of MADS. This BAA helps the Air Force meet objectives to that end, specifically:</p>
<p>1. Create an alternative design concept to reduce volume and weight of one Key System below that shows high confidence of being integrated with current ADS technology to create a MADS:</p>
<p>a. Prime Power (to include Power Generation, Power Conditioning, and Power Storage)<br />b. Thermal Management<br />c. High Efficiency Source<br />d. Alternative Antenna Concepts</p>
<p>2. Characterize the maturity of proposed component technologies.</p>
<p>3. Identify projected reliability and maintainability of proposed approach.</p>

<p>No data on the MRAP vehicles will be provided by the Government in conjunction with this BAA.</p>
<p>The following data submittal is expected to be required for any contract(s) awarded as a result of white paper proposal selection:</p>
<p>A Mid-Term Technical Presentation must be delivered at the middle of the performance period and a Final Technical Report must be delivered at the end of the performance period. The Mid-Term Technical Presentation must be presented at Eglin AFB to the 687 ARSS and submitted electronically in Microsoft PowerPoint 2007, XP, or compatible format. The Final Technical Report must be submitted electronically in Microsoft Word 2007, XP, or compatible format. 687 ARSS must be given authorization to read and write to the electronic document. This final report, as with the white paper proposal, must address the objectives and guidance set forth in the BAA.</p>
<p>With respect to the Final Technical Report, the Government negotiator will work out an appropriate Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) with each selected respondent, unless a CDRL is not appropriate.</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance: will end no later than 15 September 2009 (including final report delivery)</p>
<p>Type of Contract: The anticipated contract type for awards under this BAA will be Firm Fixed Price. The Air Force reserves the right to award other contract types or assistance instruments in lieu of contracts.</p>
<p>Anticipated Number of Awards: The Air Force anticipates making multiple awards based upon the following list:<br />&bull; Prime Power concept and designs approximately $300,000.00 each<br />&bull; Thermal management concept and designs approximately $250,000.00 each<br />&bull; Alternative antenna concept and designs approximately $50,000.00 each<br />&bull; High efficiency gyrotron source concept and designs approximately $50,000.00 each</p>
<p>All anticipated awards are within the limits of available funding, approximately $1.5M.</p>
<p>WHITE PAPER PROPOSAL EVALUATION</p>
<p>White paper proposals will be evaluated using the factors given below.</p>
<p>1. Relevant Experience (Does the respondent appear to be able to perform meaningful work with regard to ADS technologies?) The respondent's capabilities, ADS-related experience (to include past and present work) as a system developer/integrator, systems engineering techniques, or unique combinations of these that are integral factors for achieving the described objectives. The intellectual capital/expertise and industrial know-how/capability available will be evaluated.<br />2. Credible Approach (Does the white paper reveal a likelihood of the respondent successfully addressing the study objectives.) An assessment of the proposed analysis, design, and integration approach to include scientific and/or technical merits, and associated risks, will be made.<br />3. Potential Return (Does the approach described appear to offer a path to a smaller lighter Key System?) The credible approach must indicate a system concept that meets the objectives listed in Section B - one that would seem to reasonably overcome development and integration challenges. "Break-through" alternative subcomponents designs or integration concepts, with articulate illuminating descriptions that reduce the perception of risk, will also be considered on balance.</p>
<p>It is the policy of 808 ARSG/687 ARSS to treat all white paper proposals as privileged information prior to award, and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;An Ombudsman has been appointed to address the concerns of offerors or potential offerors.&nbsp; The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the Program Manager or Contracting Officer, but communicates Contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.&nbsp; When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.&nbsp; The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.&nbsp; Matters of routine or administrative nautre concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the Contracting points of contact identified below.&nbsp; The Ombudsman is Colonel Arnold W.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A-10 European and Pacific In-theater Depots<br />Industry Day and Risk Assessment Workshop</span></strong></p>
<p><br /><strong>SCOPE</strong></p>
<p><br />The A-10 System Program Office (SPO) will be hosting an Industry Day to discuss the United States Air Force requirement for in-theater contract depot repair support for A-10 aircraft based overseas at Spangdahlem AB, Germany (USAFE) and Osan AB, Republic of South Korea (PACAF). The A-10 SPO is interested in meeting with industry representatives to answer questions and receive feedback regarding this requirement to assist with acquisition planning and program strategy. As part of this Industry Day, a Risk Assessment Workshop will be conducted with industry attendees to aid the A-10 SPO with identification of potential risks areas and mitigation options to be considered.</p>
<p><br /><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p><br />There are two separate requirements contracts associated with this Industry Day. For each region of operation, Europe and the Republic of South Korea, the U.S Government intends to make a single award to a technically responsive source with a 5-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract. The estimated workload is 3-6 aircraft inductions per fiscal year for SLEP/SSI plus occasional drop-in maintenance and Contract Field Team deployments as necessary. Future aircraft modification programs may also be a requirement for these contracts. Historical aircraft induction numbers and future projections for the proposed contract period are included in the slides attached to this posting. Please note that although Precision Engagement modifications are included as a projected requirement for PACAF, the USAF has not yet determined whether these modifications will be completed by the in-theater depot facility or performed by way of aircraft swaps with previously modified aircraft. In addition, please refer to the briefing slides attached to this posting for descriptions of the SLEP and SSI programs.</p>
<p><br />In order to be considered for this workload, a qualified offeror must operate the proposed depot maintenance facility within unrefueled A-10 flight range (approximately 400 Nautical Miles) of the respective A-10 operating location (Spangdahlem or Osan AB).</p>
<p><br /><strong>INDUSTRY DAY</strong></p>
<p><br />1. At this time the government does not intend to limit the number of representatives attending from each contractor's firm. However, depending on responses from industry, the government may be forced to impose limits due to room capacity.</p>
<p>2. In order to attend Industry Day, each contractor must provide the following for each attendee:</p>
<p>a. Name, address and CAGE code of firm<br />b. Indicate status of company - Small Business or Large Business<br />c. Full Name of individual, citizenship status and contact information</p>
<p>This information must be received by the Industry Day POC via email not later than <strong>17 November 2008</strong>.</p>
<p><br />In addition, all foreign national attendees must submit a Foreign Visit Request through their respective embassy. Please contact the Industry Day POC with any questions or concerns.</p>
<p><br />3. If any individual contractor wishes to have one on one sessions with government personnel, requests should be made by 17 Nov 08. Individual time allocations will be made by the government and provided to contractors prior to Industry Days.</p>
<p>4. An optional tour of the Ogden Air Logistics Center A-10 Depot Repair Line is being considered. Please indicate your interest in attending a tour and the number of attendees by 17 Nov 08.</p>
<p>5. A Base Access Letter will be coordinated in advance once your RSVP and Foreign Visit Request (if applicable) have been received. If you require any assistance obtaining base access or directions to the conference room location (Building 1234, Main Conference Room), please advise the Industry Day POC.</p>
<p>6. Tentative agenda for this event:</p>
<p>19 Nov 08<br />0730-0800 Attendees proceed to Building 1234, Main Conference Room<br />0800-0930 Government Briefing to Industry-Includes Q&amp;A<br />1000-1130 Risk Assessment Workshop (Location TBD)<br />1300-1600 Risk Assessment Workshop (continued)</p>
<p>20 Nov 08<br />0800-0900 OO-ALC A-10 Depot Facility Tour (Optional - pending attendee interest)<br />1030-1700 One-on-one sessions between individual contractors and government (Bldg 1233, South Conference Room)</p>
<p>&emsp;<br /><strong>RISK ASSESSMENT WORKSHOP</strong></p>
<p><br />A Risk Assessment Workshop (RAW) will be conducted to allow industry representatives to participate in risk identification and handling/mitigation options for the in-theater depot repair requirement. This workshop will aid the A-10 SPO with the development of a comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation strategy to ensure the success of achieving USAF objectives and requirements for in-theater contract repair of A-10 aircraft. <br />The RAW will be conducted by utilizing a computer-based Risk Management Information System. This system permits participants to brainstorm and anonymously submit potential program risk areas to be considered by the risk assessment team. Additional details and instructions regarding the use of this system will be provided during Industry Day. Due to space constraints, each contractor will be limited to two attendees for the RAW and assigned to a single computer terminal.</p>
<p><br />The A-10 SPO's past history with depot repair for the A-10 has shown that it is very difficult to accurately forecast depot repair requirements due to many unknown and unforeseen requirements that arise. This occurs in part because the A-10 is an aging aircraft that is experiencing problems with structural fatigue cracking. Historically, depot repair requirements have consistently exceeded projections resulting in increased work effort and funding added to the in-theater repair contracts. The A-10 SPO is interested in receiving input from industry regarding methods of managing the resulting program risks created by the inherent uncertainty of the requirements.</p>
<p><br />Contractor participants are asked to come prepared to indentify specific cost, schedule, performance, and technical risk areas associated with the in-theater depot repair requirement for A-10 aircraft. An internal risk assessment conducted by the A-10 SPO has identified the following top risk statements:</p>
<p><br />1. If significant unforeseen aircraft problems arise (i.e. additional structural cracking), then schedule and performance will be impacted.</p>
<p><br />2. If structural inspections drive excessive over-and-above repairs, then the contract ceiling may be exceeded.</p>
<p><br />3. If new inspection requirements are added in the future, pricing agreements must be renegotiated.</p>
<p><br />4. If available funding is decreased, then aircraft inductions must be reduced.</p>
<p><br />5. If aircraft structural inspection criteria are not clearly defined by the technical data, then defects in the aircraft may go unnoticed.</p>
<p><br />6. If new aircraft modification programs become a requirement in the future, then contract must be renegotiated/re-competed to add additional workload.</p>
<p><br />7. If contractor cannot obtain parts support from suppliers, then production delays will result.</p>
<p><br />8. If a new contractor is selected, then Government Furnished Equipment must be transferred to the new contractor.</p>
<p><br />9. If contractor's proposed flow-time is exceeded, then aircraft induction schedule must be modified to meet aircraft availability requirements.</p>
<p><br />10. If aircraft flying rates (ops tempo) changes, then aircraft induction requirements may increase or decrease.</p>
<p><br />11. If contractor cannot obtain PKI certification to access U.S. Government information systems such as Technical Order databases, then contract performance will be impacted.</p>
<p><br />12. If contractor facility's host nation has strict customs restrictions, then additional import/export fees may be incurred.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A-10 European and Pacific In-theater Depots<br />Industry Day and Risk Assessment Workshop</span></strong></p>
<p><br /><strong>SCOPE</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><br />The A-10 System Program Office (SPO) will be hosting an Industry Day to discuss the United States Air Force requirement for in-theater contract depot repair support for A-10 aircraft based overseas at Spangdahlem AB, Germany (USAFE) and Osan AB, Republic of South Korea (PACAF). The A-10 SPO is interested in meeting with industry representatives to answer questions and receive feedback regarding this requirement to assist with acquisition planning and program strategy. As part of this Industry Day, a Risk Assessment Workshop will be conducted with industry attendees to aid the A-10 SPO with identification of potential risks areas and mitigation options to be considered.</p>
<p><br /><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p><br />There are two separate requirements contracts associated with this Industry Day. For each region of operation, Europe and the Republic of South Korea, the U.S Government intends to make a single award to a technically responsive source with a 5-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract. The estimated workload is 3-6 aircraft inductions per fiscal year for SLEP/SSI plus occasional drop-in maintenance and Contract Field Team deployments as necessary. Future aircraft modification programs may also be a requirement for these contracts. Historical aircraft induction numbers and future projections for the proposed contract period are included in the slides attached to this posting. Please note that although Precision Engagement modifications are included as a projected requirement for PACAF, the USAF has not yet determined whether these modifications will be completed by the in-theater depot facility or performed by way of aircraft swaps with previously modified aircraft. In addition, please refer to the briefing slides attached to this posting for descriptions of the SLEP and SSI programs. <br /><br />In order to be considered for this workload, a qualified offeror must operate the proposed depot maintenance facility within unrefueled A-10 flight range (approximately 400 Nautical Miles) of the respective A-10 operating location (Spangdahlem or Osan AB).</p>
<p><br /><strong>INDUSTRY DAY</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><br />1. At this time the government does not intend to limit the number of representatives attending from each contractor's firm. However, depending on responses from industry, the government may be forced to impose limits due to room capacity.</p>
<p>2. In order to attend Industry Day, each contractor must provide the following for each attendee:</p>
<p>a. Name, address and CAGE code of firm<br />b. Indicate status of company - Small Business or Large Business<br />c. Full Name of individual, citizenship status and contact information</p>
<p>This information must be received by the Industry Day POC via email not later than <strong>17 November 2008.</strong></p>
<p>
<p><strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
In addition, all foreign national attendees must submit a Foreign Visit Request through their respective embassy. Please contact the Industry Day POC with any questions or concerns. </strong></p>
</p>
<p><br />3. If any individual contractor wishes to have one on one sessions with government personnel, requests should be made by 17 Nov 08. Individual time allocations will be made by the government and provided to contractors prior to Industry Days.</p>
<p>4. An optional tour of the Ogden Air Logistics Center A-10 Depot Repair Line is being considered. Please indicate your interest in attending a tour and the number of attendees by 17 Nov 08.</p>
<p>5. A Base Access Letter will be coordinated in advance once your RSVP and Foreign Visit Request (if applicable) have been received. If you require any assistance obtaining base access or directions to the conference room location (Building 1234, Main Conference Room), please advise the Industry Day POC.</p>
<p>6. Tentative agenda for this event:</p>
<p>19 Nov 08<br />0730-0800 Attendees proceed to Building 1234, Main Conference Room<br />0800-0930 Government Briefing to Industry-Includes Q&amp;A<br />1000-1130 Risk Assessment Workshop (Location TBD)<br />1300-1600 Risk Assessment Workshop (continued)</p>
<p>20 Nov 08<br />0800-0900 OO-ALC A-10 Depot Facility Tour (Optional - pending attendee interest)<br />1030-1700 One-on-one sessions between individual contractors and government (Bldg 1233, South Conference Room)</p>
<p>&emsp;<br /><strong>RISK ASSESSMENT WORKSHOP</strong></p>
<p><br />A Risk Assessment Workshop (RAW) will be conducted to allow industry representatives to participate in risk identification and handling/mitigation options for the in-theater depot repair requirement. This workshop will aid the A-10 SPO with the development of a comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation strategy to ensure the success of achieving USAF objectives and requirements for in-theater contract repair of A-10 aircraft.</p>
<p><br />The RAW will be conducted by utilizing a computer-based Risk Management Information System. This system permits participants to brainstorm and anonymously submit potential program risk areas to be considered by the risk assessment team. Additional details and instructions regarding the use of this system will be provided during Industry Day. Due to space constraints, each contractor will be limited to two attendees for the RAW and assigned to a single computer terminal.</p>
<p><br />The A-10 SPO's past history with depot repair for the A-10 has shown that it is very difficult to accurately forecast depot repair requirements due to many unknown and unforeseen requirements that arise. This occurs in part because the A-10 is an aging aircraft that is experiencing problems with structural fatigue cracking. Historically, depot repair requirements have consistently exceeded projections resulting in increased work effort and funding added to the in-theater repair contracts. The A-10 SPO is interested in receiving input from industry regarding methods of managing the resulting program risks created by the inherent uncertainty of the requirements.</p>
<p><br />Contractor participants are asked to come prepared to indentify specific cost, schedule, performance, and technical risk areas associated with the in-theater depot repair requirement for A-10 aircraft. An internal risk assessment conducted by the A-10 SPO has identified the following top risk statements:</p>
<p><br />1. If significant unforeseen aircraft problems arise (i.e. additional structural cracking), then schedule and performance will be impacted.</p>
<p><br />2. If structural inspections drive excessive over-and-above repairs, then the contract ceiling may be exceeded.</p>
<p><br />3. If new inspection requirements are added in the future, pricing agreements must be renegotiated.</p>
<p><br />4. If available funding is decreased, then aircraft inductions must be reduced.</p>
<p><br />5. If aircraft structural inspection criteria are not clearly defined by the technical data, then defects in the aircraft may go unnoticed.</p>
<p><br />6. If new aircraft modification programs become a requirement in the future, then contract must be renegotiated/re-competed to add additional workload.</p>
<p><br />7. If contractor cannot obtain parts support from suppliers, then production delays will result.</p>
<p><br />8. If a new contractor is&nbsp;selected, then Government Furnished Equipment must be transferred to the new contractor.</p>
<p><br />9. If contractor's proposed flow-time is exceeded, then aircraft induction schedule must be modified to meet aircraft availability requirements.</p>
<p><br />10. If aircraft flying rates (ops tempo) changes, then aircraft induction requirements may increase or decrease.</p>
<p><br />11. If contractor cannot obtain PKI certification to access U.S. Government information systems such as Technical Order databases, then contract performance will be impacted.</p>
<p><br />12. If contractor facility's host nation has strict customs restrictions, then additional import/export fees may be incurred.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to amend the Joint and Allied Threat Awareness System (JATAS) Pre-Solicitation synopsis released under N00019-08-R-0043 on February 27, 2008. The objective of the overall JATAS effort is to develop a cost effective threat awareness system to enhance aircraft survivability by providing advanced missile warning capability; aircrew warning of laser-based weapon systems such as range finders, illuminators, and beam riders; and a Hostile Fire Indication for small arms, rockets, and other threats. JATAS must interface with existing AN/ALE-47 Countermeasures Dispensing System (CMDS), and be capable of interfacing with a laser based Directed Infrared Countermeasure as part of electronic countermeasures response to attacking infrared missiles. The JATAS will be controlled by the host aircrafts mission computer with operator interface/control being accomplished via the multifunctional display or a separate control indicator. In most cases, command and control of the JATAS will be through the AN/APR-39A/B(V)2 Radar Signal Detecting Set (RSDS). 

This anticipated JATAS System Development award competition will be divided into two phases: A Technology Development Phase and an Engineering and Manufacturing Development and Demonstration Phase.  The Technology Development Phase will be conducted as a full and open competition that will result in a contract award to two separate vendors, selected from a competitive range, that meet the criteria and requirements listed in the Formal Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Technology Development phase.  The second phase (which will follow approximately sixteen months after TD Phase award) will be the Engineering and Manufacturing and Development Demonstration (EMDD), which will be a limited competition between the two vendors who were awarded contracts in the Technology Development phase.   


NAVAIR has posted the FORMAL RFP to the NAVAIR Homepage website under N00019-08-R-0043.  The RFP will not be posted on any other WEB site. The NAVAIR Homepage is located at http://www.navair.navy.mil and can be accessed using Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer.

<DESC>CORRECTION:  Please reference Request for Proposal Number VA-791-09-RP-0002.  THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT TO RAISE AWARENESS FOR POTENTIAL OFFERORS.  The Veterans Administration (VA), Denver Acquisition & Logistics Center, 155 Van Gordon Street, Lakewood, CO, 80228, intends to solicit for proposals from well qualified experienced sources from any size businesses that are capable of providing one or more of the following types of hearing aids:  Group 1 - Custom Digital Hearing Aids; Group 2 - Behind-the-Ear Digital Hearing Aids (standard, and open ear fitting behind-the-ear); Group 3 - Receiver-in-the-canal Digital Hearing Aids; Group 4 - CROS, BICROS and Multi-CROS Wireless Programmable Hearing Aids; and Group 5 - Hearing Aid Remote Controls (optional devices).  Remote controls must be compatible with hearing aids offered in Group 1-4 that are offered and determined to be considered for an award.  Offerors that do not receive an award in one or more Groups will not receive consideration on remote controls.  No more than one award will be made for on a model/brand.The VA DALC anticipates making one or more fixed price, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract awards in each Group (1-4) to afford competition and cover the needs of the Government.  The contracted items will be a mandatory source for VA Audiology and Speech Pathology Services at the VA Medical Centers.  Other Government agencies (such as Department of Defense, Indian Health Services, Health & Human Services and Bureau of Prisons) may use any awarded contract as a non-mandatory source.  The requirements also cover primary and secondary features, extra components, programming software and training related to the hearing aids.  Current ISO 9000 certification for the manufacturing facility will be required; along with adapted measures to ensure that any personally identifiable information (PII) associated with individual veterans is adequately protected from loss, misuse, or unauthorized disclosure.The contract period will be November 1, 2009 through October 31, 2010, with four one-year options to be exercised at the discretion of the VA DALC.  Subject procurement is being procured as a commercial item as defined in FAR Part 12.  Subject contracts award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 12 and 15.  Subject announcement is provided in order to satisfy the requirements of FAR Part 5.  The North American Classification Code is 334510 and Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.  The requirement package will be issued as a "full and open" solicitation for any and all qualified, experienced, and knowledgeable business entity who can meet the requirements.  The acquisition will be procured as a "Best Value" type of acquisition where price and other-non-price factors allow for evaluation trade-offs to achieve the best value contracts for the government.  Non-priced factors (technical, experience and capacity, past performance and veteran programs), when combined, will be considered significantly more important than price.  Solicitation documents will be available electronically on or about January 22, 2009 at the FedBizOpps website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  NO HARD COPIES OF THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED.  The anticipated RFP closing date is February 24, 2009 at 4:00 p.m. (Mountain Time).  The Contracting Officer for this acquisition is Gail A Hixon (gail.hixon@va.gov).
