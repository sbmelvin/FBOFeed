This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.

Mandatory Language:  (a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. 
(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).
(c) The Competition Advocate (CA) at each contracting activity/office (as defined in DLAD 2.101) shall act as the ombudsman and attempt to resolve contractor complaints.  DLA-Aviation-AOB's CA/ombudsman can be reached at (405) 734-8241, facsimile (405) 734-8129.  Complaints which cannot be so resolved shall be forwarded to the HQ through J-72 for resolution by the DLA competition advocate.  Each activity is responsible for developing procedures for executing the duties and responsibilities of its local ombudsman. (d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. (e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer. 12.

The contractor shall provide all management, tools, equipment, and labor necessary to ensure that custodial services are performed at HQ SACT in a manner that will maintain a satisfactory facility condition and present a clean, neat and professional appearance.
<p>The bidding procedure will be Sealed Bidding (two envelopes). The award will be based on the lowest price that is technically acceptable. Partial bidding is not authorized.<br /><br />The reference for the Invitation for International Bidding (IFIB) is ACT-SACT-14-24.</p>
<p>Potential prime contractors must 1) be pre-approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and 2) must have performed similar tasking to the requirement described in the solicitation. Contractor personnel performing services under the contract must be citizens of a NATO nation and must have appropriate professional training and experience in a related field.</p>
<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the U.S. Government nominate U.S. prime contractors to the bidders list. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. prime contractor to the bidders list for this procurement, the firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume indicating contracts completed as a prime contractor and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.</p>
<p>U.S. firms can download a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application from the following website:</p>
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/strategic-industries-and-economic-security-sies/nato-related-business-opportunities</p>
<p>The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>Upon approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. A DOE is used to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>
<p>Firms should request a DOE (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit a completed one-time NATO ICB application) by: 06 January 2015</p>
<p>Please note, however, that HQ SACT will accept nominations to the bidders list (DOEs) past the nomination deadline and up to the bid closing date.</p>
<p>IFIB release (target): 09 January 2015</p>
<p>The IFIB will be unclassified and will be posted on the following website: <br />http://www.act.nato.int/contracting-procurements</p>
<p>Bid closing (target): 19 February 2015</p>
<p>Period of performance: 01 March 2015 - 29 February 2006 with an option for four additional 12 month periods</p>

<DESC>NASA encourages innovative and entrepreneurial efforts within the private sector to develop new space-related capabilities.  These new capabilities may result in opportunities for industry to provide cost-effective commercial products and services to low Earth orbit and beyond for the Government and other customers.  In pursuit of the goals of the National Space Policy and NASAs strategic plan, NASA is continuing its efforts to foster the development of new industrial space-related capabilities that will lead to education and job growth in science and engineering and spur economic growth as capabilities for new space markets are created. Based on the responses to this synopsis, NASA may solicit proposals from all interested U.S. private enterprises that wish to enter into Space Act Agreements (SAA) for collaboration on emerging commercial space capabilities.  The purpose of the agreements would be to advance entrepreneurial space-related efforts by facilitating access to NASAs vast spaceflight resources including technical expertise, assessments, lessons learned, technologies, and data.  Additional Government provided resources such as access to facilities and services will be evaluated on a case by case basis depending on the degree of benefit to both parties.  With this activity, NASA intends to focus on facilitating the development of integrated space capabilities, not individual technologies or subsystem development efforts.	Should a solicitation go forward, NASA would use its other transactions authority within the National Aeronautics and Space Act, 51 U.S.C.  20113(e), to enter into multiple SAAs where each party bears the cost of its participation, and there is no exchange of funds between the parties. The SAAs resulting from any potential solicitation will serve as an agency-level mechanism for NASA and its partners to agree to a series of mutually beneficial activities that are expected to be consistent with NASAs 2011 Strategic Plan. There must be specific, identifiable benefits to one or more elements of Strategic Goal 1 to extend and sustain human activities across the solar system. The goal of the SAAs would be to advance private sector development of integrated space capabilities so that the emerging products or services are commercially available to government and non-government customers within approximately the next five years. This activity would be an additional opportunity to partner with NASA and is not intended to preclude ongoing or future partnership discussions directly with the NASA centers.	 NASA will only consider proposals from U.S. private enterprises (including non-profit organizations) or commercial providers as defined by the Commercial Space Act of 1998. There may be future opportunities for the private sector to submit proposals to NASA for these types of agreements after the initial selections are made. To assist NASA in preparing for this potential competition, please notify the point of contact listed in this synopsis of your interest by August 7, 2013. Your non-binding letter of intent should include the company name, point of contact, address, phone number, email, brief description of the space capability planned to be developed, and nature of interest as either a primary participant or team member. NASA intends to use information submitted in response to this synopsis in the formulation of one or more solicitations seeking competitive proposals related to the initiatives described herein. The Government intends to release the company names, addresses, and points of contact of all respondents unless specifically requested not to do so by the respondent. This information will be provided on the competition website in an Interested Parties List to allow potential participants the opportunity to network.  NASA will not affirmatively release any other information received in response to this synopsis to the public. Any information submitted in response to this synopsis that is marked as Confidential Commercial or Financial Information will be considered as voluntarily submitted in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act. If NASA proceeds with the competition, potential participants are responsible for monitoring the Internet website for the release of the Announcement for Proposals and for downloading their own copy of the Announcement and amendments.	A website has been established for this activity: http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/ccsc/	   The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/JSC Business Opportunities page is: http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=73	  An Ombudsman has been appointed  See NASA Specific Note B. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation or submit a proposal.  All questions must be submitted in writing to the Agreements Officer via email or fax referencing the solicitation number in the subject line. Telephone questions will not be accepted. NASA does not intend to publicly post questions and answers to this synopsis.  As necessary, further information will be provided as amendments to this synopsis.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INTRODUCTION<br /></span></strong>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A CONTRACT OR PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME).</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA) on behalf of the Information Technology and Applications Center (ITAC) intends to negotiate and award a contract without providing for full and open competition to (Including brand-name) &Uuml;berResearch, Inc., 214 Captains Watch, Lexington, SC 29072-6677 for NHLBI Grant Funding Analysis and ReviewerFinder.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br /></span></strong>The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 541511 with a Size Standard of $25.5 M.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REGULATORY AUTHORITY<br /></span></strong>The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-79 effective on December 15, 2014.</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the procedures as prescribed in FAR subpart 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR subpart 15-Contracting by Negotiation at an amount exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold ($150,000).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">STATUTORY AUTHORITY<br /></span></strong>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 United States Code (U.S.C.) 253(c)(1) under provisions of the statutory authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1-Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>

The company has extensive knowledge and experience in peer review and scientific portfolio analysis on an international level. They can provide both thesaurus and non-thesaurus bases indexing of grants. They can also provide disambiguation algorithms and services of people and organizations across multiple data sets. <br /><br />Based on the 10 responses and past performance with UberResearch, no further market research was needed. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CLOSING STATEMENT<br /></span></strong>This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC><strong>SOLICITATION NUMBER: HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-RFP-15-032<br />PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE INFORMATION<br /></strong><br /><strong>Title:<br /></strong>NIDA IRP Clinical Protocol Participant Recruitment Support<br /><br /><strong>Contracting Office Address:<br /></strong>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Drug Abuse, Station Support Simplified Acquisitions, 31 Center Drive, Room 1B59, Bethesda, MD 20892, UNITED STATES. <br /><strong><br />Introduction:<br />This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice of Intent. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. A solicitation will be issued on a later date.<br /></strong><br />The purpose of this pre-solicitation is to notify potential offerors that the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) intends to solicit proposals for NIDA Intramural Research Program (IRP) Clinical Protocol Participant Recruitment Support from qualified contractors having the capability to perform the tasks identified in this pre-solicitation. <br /><br />This acquisition is a re-competition of the Participant Recruitment Support requirement of the NIDA IRP Clinical Research Program. The initial Participant Recruitment Support contract (HHSN271201100030C) was awarded in 2011 to Matthews Media Group, Inc.<br /><br /><strong>Requirement Background Information:<br /></strong>The Intramural Research Program (IRP) of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is located on the campus of Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center (JHBMC) in Baltimore, Maryland. Using volunteer human participants, the IRP clinical program conducts multidisciplinary research involving residential and nonresidential clinical studies. In general, these studies evaluate the nature of drug use disorders and addiction by assessing the abuse potential of drugs, investigating their underlying mechanisms, and assessing treatment modalities for these disorders. <br /><br />As many IRP clinical protocols investigate addictive or potentially addictive drugs, they require research participants who are active drug users, clients of drug abuse treatment programs, individuals seeking treatment for drug abuse or persons with a documented history of drug use or addiction. <br /><br /><strong>Purpose and Objectives for the Requirement:<br /></strong>The purpose of this procurement is to obtain contractor support services for the recruitment of eligible research participants for inclusion in clinical research studies conducted by NIDA IRP as part of its ongoing mission. <br /><br /><strong>Project Tasks/Requirements:<br /></strong>The NIDA IRP requires support in the following task areas: <br /><br />1. Project Management <br /><br />It is the responsibility of the Contractor to ensure adequate staffing and any supervision of that staff. The Contractor will assure smooth daily operations of the Recruiting Department to include staffing the call center, providing for in-person screening and managing the flow of participants throughout the day. Reports will need to reflect effectiveness of various types of advertising as well as volume of phone screens, in person screens and participants sent for clearance to protocols and participants consented to protocols. The invoicing needs to include costs associated with the screening process such as participant transportation and meals if needed as well as the staffing hours, ads developed and run, and tracking of participant remuneration. Monthly reports to the Project Officer, OCD and participating PI will reflect the performance outcomes of each recruitment strategy.
<p>2. Advertisement Support</p>
<p>The advertising support will be in two main divisions; first is the steady state advertising common to all the Principal Investigators (PIs). This includes postings to Craigslist and maintaining the NIDA IRP Recruiting website. The second division will allow for the PIs (up to four) to opt-in and use the Contractor as their marketing team to develop ads, suggest ways to deploy the advertising as well as actually running the ads or outreach campaign.</p>
<p>As the NIDA IRP is based in Baltimore, the overwhelming majority of advertising is in this market. Participants are only recruited from the local area. Common forms of advertising include local newspapers, bus ads, radio ads and some web advertising such as craigslist posting.</p>
<p>Community outreach is another form of advertising that is frequently used. It may include posting fliers in businesses, public and private colleges and school systems and other places. The Contractor may be asked to attend local events as a means of raising awareness of NIDA research opportunities to community resource groups or arrange for in-services for specific research team members to appropriately target audiences in the community. Lastly, the Contractor may be asked to attend local activities that are primarily for entertainment for recruiting purposes.</p>
<p>The Contractor will work with study teams to provide timely creation of protocol and/or population specific advertisements prior to enrollment of the first participant. Also, the Contractor will frequently re-assess the effectiveness of the marketing strategies used and suggest changes to improve the recruitment of specific target populations.</p>
<p>3. Participant Screening</p>
<p>The screening of NIDA IRP participants occurs in two phases: telephone and in person. If the potential participant appears during telephone interviewing to fit the inclusion/exclusion criteria of a current protocol, they are invited to come to the BRC for an in-person screen.</p>
<p>Generally, the in-person screen takes six to eight hours and is conducted in one day. Currently the NIDA IRP conducts 350 telephone screening interviews monthly. The Contractor will provide Bachelors level staff trained and proficient in performing structured telephone interview to determine eligibility and/or acceptability of participant in research protocols.</p>
<p>The in-person screening process requires coordination with NIDA IRP staff including but not limited to Physician Assistants, Nurse Practitioners and Physicians. The Contractor will provide the staffing necessary for basic medical assessments including obtaining vital signs, drawing blood, performing ECGs, urine pregnancy testing, CO monitoring, breathalyzer and testing urine for drugs of abuse. The Contractor will also supply the CLIA waiver testing kits needed for pregnancy, HIV and urine testing for drugs of abuse.</p>
<p>The staff conducting the in-person screening must have knowledge of drug use disorders, medical and psychiatric measures and psychiatric interviewing. The staff obtains informed consent from each participant for screening protocol and procedures including completion of appropriate screening instruments. Strong interpersonal skills will ensure appropriate explanations of the current research protocols for which the participant may be eligible in the most professional manner.</p>
<p>As the records of NIDA IRP are electronic, computer proficiency is needed to ensure proper and accurate recording of participant clinical record. The staff will coordinate repeat testing and follow up evaluations, as needed with study participants under the guidance from research team members. Also, appropriate referrals to community providers for medical and drug treatment will be provided as needed during recruitment in coordination with the research team. The staff may perform exit interviews with individual screened for research participation by the IRP.</p>
<p>4. Participant Remuneration</p>
<p>The Contractor will be responsible for the remuneration of all the NIDA IRP participants. In keeping with the NIDA Remuneration Policy, as participants complete sections of a protocol, it is indicated in the NIDA electronic medical records system, Human Research Information System (HuRIS). At pre-determined times within each protocol participants are allowed to collect funds. The funds may be checks, paying bills for the participant, gift cards or cash as defined by the protocol. The HuRIS records must then be married up to the Contractor records of funds. If PIs approach the allowable limit of their funds for remuneration, the PI and Clinical Director must be alerted in advance.</p>
<p>5. Training and Documenting Issues</p>
<p>The Contractor will assure that all staff members comply with current and future requirements mandated for human subjects' protection, including but not limited to NIH/NIDA /IRP clinical, ethical, informed consent, good clinical practice (GCP), confidentiality, privacy and conflict of interest requirements. Likewise, any necessary training and/or clearances as required for working with special populations (OPM/FBI) including children and adolescents will be completed as required by NIDA IRP. The Contractor will make use of all approved (by OCD, Clinical investigators and/or IRB) forms developed by the NIDA IRP specific to the recruitment, screening and remuneration process and generally located in the electronic medical records systems or paper versions. All documents will be Section 508 compliant. The Contractor will maintain quality assurance procedures and records for all processes including but not limited to the phone screen, the various tasks of the in-person screen and the medical elements of screening (vital signs, ECG, CLIA waived testing).</p>
<p><strong>Set-Aside Status:<br /></strong>It is anticipated that the services will be acquired through <strong>unrestricted full and open competitive procedures</strong> under NAICS Code 541990.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance:<br /></strong>The anticipated period of performance is one (1) six-month base period and nine (9) six-month option periods. <br /><br /><strong>Anticipated Contract Type:<br /></strong>The NIDA anticipates the award of one (1) contract. It is anticipated that the contract type shall be cost-reimbursement.<br /><br /><strong>Request for Proposal Release Information:<br /></strong>Request for Proposal (RFP) No. NIH-NIDA-SSSA-RFP-15-032 will be available electronically on or about January 8, 2015. The RFP shall be accessible through FedBizOpps at http://fedbizopps.gov. All information required for the submission of a proposal will be contained in or accessible through the RFP package. Responses to the RFP will be due on or about 30 days following RFP release. Offerors must submit a proposal for all Task Areas in order to be considered for award. WE ENCOURAGE ALL RESPONSIBLE SOURCES TO SUBMIT A PROPOSAL WHICH WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE AGENCY.<br /><br /><strong>Notes:</strong> <br />This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. It is the Offeror's responsibility to monitor the above mentioned site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.</p>

<DESC>This is the NAVUSP WSS synopsis for FY 2015 orders to be placed under Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) with L-3 Communication N00104-14-G-A100. L-3 is the Original Equipment Manufacturer and the only known source to possess full repair capability located in Camden, NJ (cage 11447).  The repairs will be for 15 NSNs.  Complete data, drawings and the rights to the same are not available from the Government.  For a complete list of all items to be repaired or any questions concerning this notice, contact Jennifer Morrison 717-605-1705.

The subject items require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the items are mission critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.
  Only the source previously approved by the Government for repair of these items has been solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.

<DESC>This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract and is not a request for competitive proposals. The statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as prescribed 6.302-1. The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) intends to issue a sole source, firm-fixed-price "D" type contract, utilizing FAR 12.2 procedures for commercial services, to Det Norske Veritas - Germanischer Lloyd (DNV-GL). The period of issuance of orders shall not exceed 24 months and the contract with the period of performance shall not exceed 6 months from the last day for issuance of orders (30 months from award). The S351, a submersible currently under development, will be delivered to USSOCOM with DNV-GL, an International Association of Classification Societies (IACS), certification for safety (class). DNV-GL will provide the Government consulting services in regards to RINA Rules and Guidance to maintain class and engineering studies of alternatives for proposed changes to the vessel, as required. DNV-GL will also provide the oversight (audits/reviews) needed to maintain the certificate of class active through the period of performance. DNV-GL will also provide technical guidance on the safety requirements for the vessel as required. <br />DNV-GL is the only source that can provide this service for the S351. Utilizing a different classing society would cause substantial duplication of effort and unacceptable delays. Costs to recertify the DCS under a different IACS member would far exceed the costs of maintaining its current certification. Changing IACS societies would require dismantling of vessel for inspection, drawing and specification reviews, testing of vessel, implementation of design standards for the specific classification society etc. The down-time it would take for the reclassification process would cause substantial delays in fulfilling agency requirements.<br />This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 541690 Other Scientific and Technical Consulting. Size standard is $14.0.<br />The proposed source is Det Norske Veritas - Germanischer Lloyd (DNV-GL), Brooktorkai 18, Hamburg, Germany 20457. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or quotation which shall be considered by the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />Responses are due no later than 3:00 PM EDT on Wednesday September 30, 2014. If no affirmative responses are received by 3:00 PM EDT, Wednesday September 30, 2014 to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, a contract will be negotiated and awarded to DNV-GL.

<p>3. Background<br />The Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC), Requirements and Acquisition Division (CXA) manages the Airfield Damage Repair (ADR) Modernization program. The main focus of the program is to expedite airfield recovery after attack. For this purpose, two components are critical and consist of damage and unexploded explosive ordnance (UXO) assessment and UXO mitigation. With regards to pavements, assessment focuses on the identification of the damage thus providing information about the types of repairs needed to reestablish pavement functionality. Concerning UXO, assessment centers on identifying and recognizing the type, condition, and status of unexploded ordnance, whereas mitigation provides the means to neutralize/dispose the unexploded item.</p>
<p>4. General Intent<br />AFCEC/CXA is planning to include in the ADR modernization program additional developmental efforts with the objective of enhancing commercial technologies related to the assessment and mitigation systems for pavement damage and UXO. The AFCEC/CXA is seeking to accelerate candidate prototype technologies to provide commercially-viable solutions to current and future pavement damage and UXO assessment and mitigation requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Description<br />AFCEC/CXA is requesting information from US Industry to assure the airbase operational mission. The request is centered on the current state-of-the-art assessment and mitigation technologies related, primarily to pavement damage and UXO; however, assessment and mitigation of the hard surfaces is also of great concern and must be taken into account. The main objective is to identify and accelerate candidate technologies to provide solutions to future airfield damage assessment and UXO mitigation requirements. AFCEC/CXA is interested in the evaluation of current technologies and technologies not yet at full maturation (prototypes, Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5 (Attachment 1) or greater) that can be tailored and eventually exploited, within a limited timeframe, to meet rigorous requirements for assessment and UXO mitigation and provide commercially-viable and producible solutions. The Government encourages respondents to leverage analysis and work conducted in previous efforts.</p>
<p>6. Information Requested<br />The following list provides a series of questions focusing on the areas of automation, image processing, and sensors for damage assessment and UXO assessment and mitigation.</p>
<p>i. Rapid damage assessment<br />&bull; What are the technologies that can be utilized for automated detection of pavement damage (e.g., cracking, damage from camouflets, craters of different size, spalling) within limited time?<br />&bull; What are the technologies or novel techniques that can assess the damage type and characteristics (affected pavement area, damage depth, and affected pavement layers)? Technologies can be completely or partially automated, include limited human interaction, minimize human exposure to harm's way, and provide results within a very limited time.<br />&bull; With regards to unpaved surfaces, what are the automated technologies for damage assessment, limiting the human interaction in terms of assessment and human exposure to harm's way?<br />&bull; What are the automated technologies that have the ability to provide rapid assessment with high-level of accuracy and certainty limiting human interaction?<br />&bull; With respect to pavement damage characteristics, what are the automated technologies that have the ability to quantify the type of repair and material quantity needed to restore the pavement in operational condition? <br />ii. Rapid UXO assessment and mitigation<br />&bull; What are the technologies for unmanned systems that provide the ability to identify UXO and assess UXO characteristics, condition and status?<br />&bull; What are the unmanned technologies that can neutralize UXO limiting physical human interaction and damage to the surrounding area?<br />&bull; What are the technologies, material processes that can rapidly neutralize UXO, limiting human interaction and damage to the surrounding area?<br />&bull; What are the technologies in the area of automated pattern recognition? <br />iii. Image processing and sensors<br />&bull; What are the technologies that can provide rapid assessment capabilities with high-level of accuracy and certainty (limiting human interaction and human exposure to harm's way)?<br />&bull; With regards to image processing, what are the technologies that can assure real-time and quasi real-time processing for operation continuity?<br />&bull; What are the sensor technologies that can be applied to identification and assessment and allow limiting human interaction, expedite decision process, and rapidly execute assessment tasks?<br />iv. The technical focus areas of automation, image analysis, and sensors have been identified. Are there alternative technical focus areas that should be considered for the objective of rapid damage assessment and UXO assessment and mitigation?<br />v. Comment on specific design tools or technologies related to the assessment and mitigation areas that your organization has available to meet the objectives of the specific focus areas. <br />&bull; What is the level of maturity of the tools/technologies identified? Are there planned investments within your organization to further mature the technology and reduce risk? <br />&bull; What level of effort (schedule, cost) is anticipated to advance the technology to the point where it can meet the focus areas objectives?<br />vi. For advanced technologies, what are the eventual boundaries and limitations for the implementation with regards to material, other technological areas, logistics, support elements, other system interaction, and manufacturability? <br />vii. For current technologies, what are the potential developments, applications, interaction with other systems, development timeline, feasibility, projected developmental costs, manufacturability, and associated risk?<br />viii. Additional questions with regards to the proposed technologies (if applicable) <br />&bull; What is the system sustainability on the field and field service support by the manufacturer?<br />&bull; Is the system portable, high level of mobility, modular, in need of heavy equipment for support?<br />&bull; Does the system utilize a unique or common computer programming? Can the system be integrated with other existing systems (of different types, with different functionality)?<br />&bull; What are the climatic limitations of the system in its operating status and storage requirements?<br />&bull; What is the time needed by the system to become operational (start-up)? For how long can the system be operational (stoppage needed for recharging, data backup/download/update)? <br />&bull; What is the system power source (solar, battery-fed, fuel)? <br />&bull; What is the system data transfer modality (wireless, fiber optics, use of specific frequency)?</p>

<p>THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. This notice is for informational and planning purposes only, and is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential business sources prior to determining the method of acquisition and possible issuance of a Request for Proposal including the use of any non-profit organization or small business programs. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of response to this Sources Sought. This notice does not constitute a solicitation for bids and proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a contract. Unless otherwise stated herein, no solicitation regarding this announcement is available. Requests for the same will be disregarded. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in the FedBizOpps. Please be aware that all information submitted in response to this request, whether written, oral, electronic, graphic, or any other medium, may be subject to disclosure upon receipt of a proper Freedom of Information Act request from any person. The Government will not pay for any materials provided in response to this synopsis and submittals will not be returned to the sender.</p>
<p>The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Space, Aerial &amp; Nuclear Networks Division<br />(AFLCMC/HNA) is seeking industry ideas and solutions to address the technical capabilities that the ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) missions will need to dominate the net-centric operational environment of the future using Common Data Link (CDL). Each vendor may be aware of any number of solutions, based upon their understanding of their customer's missions and the immediacy of their requirements. If the solutions are time phased, we would be interested in identifying the earliest possible date that some form of capability could be available.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought seeks innovative approaches for providing fieldable solutions for current and next-generation manned and unmanned ISR platforms employed by the individual and Joint Services using CDL.</p>
<p>Introduction: CDL provides the DoD standard for interoperable, multi-service, multi-agency, ISR data links for 10,000+ DoD manned/unmanned airborne and ground platforms. As the DoD CDL Executive Agent (EA), the Air Force is responsible for cross-service application of CDL RDT&amp;E Military Intelligence Program (MIP) funds facilitating compliance to Congressional and DoD mandates. The EA develops, modifies, distributes, and maintains specifications for the CDL waveform family; ensuring design configuration control, commonality, and interoperability among ISR platforms. Additionally, funds support managing resources allocated for development, maturation, and migration of CDL technologies.</p>
<p>Background: Over the past decade the Department of Defense (DoD) and other U.S. Departments and Agencies have invested heavily in high-resolution airborne sensors on manned and unmanned ISR platforms, with video collection being a primary requirement. This investment has resulted in a significant increase in the; number of ISR platforms and ISR sensors, the data rate of ISR sensors, the amount and type of data collected, and the number of users (to include tactical, allied and coalition). Investment in the data link capability to distribute collected data to both ground analysis cells and dismounts has significantly lagged sensor research, development, and fielding. This uneven balance of investment across the complete ISR end-to-end collection and distribution system has created system bottlenecks as well as increasingly complex system architectures. Data link requirements identified and defined by warfighters, system architects, military Services, the Joint Aerial Layer Network (JALN) and Programs of Record (PoRs), are driving the growth in CDL. CDL needs to evolve to provide new capabilities to meet current and future stakeholder demands.</p>
<p>Scope: This Sources Sought is directed to highly competitive potential prime contractors or contractor teams who have demonstrated experience in research, development, integration, systems engineering, and test and evaluation of complex over the horizon Tactical Data Link (TDL) communication systems and their component parts and software. The Government desires to continue dialog with those Industry partners who feel they could be a viable prime contractor capable of performing the following activities.</p>
<p>The proposed scope of work required to support the Common Data Link Program Office and its activities may include but is not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Develop innovative and affordable solutions for existing and emerging communication architectures, providing flexibility to accommodate Command and Control (C2) data and myriad types of Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), and Full-Motion Video (FMV) data for the CDL community<br />&bull; Perform research, exploratory development, advanced development, test and evaluation, and systems engineering<br />&bull; Develop selected systems and subsystems including prototype or demonstration hardware/software and models<br />&bull; Plan and oversee the integration of new systems<br />&bull; Leverage the use of CDL specifications that permit current and future ISR asset operations worldwide and provide sensor data directly via point-to-point broadcast to ground sites, airborne platforms and dismounted users<br />&bull; Demonstrate compliance with OSD and Congressional mandates to effectively utilize spectrum, use approved cryptographic equipment, and provide direct support to current and future operations<br />&bull; Develop concepts and solutions to expand the capability to relay data via air-to-air or compatible satellite links when the asset and ground site are not in line-of-sight.<br />&bull; Conduct research and development activities to support a broad spectrum of tactical, operational, and strategic ISR users<br />&bull; Develop anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) strategies and capability to overcome challenges in support of missions requiring sustained air/land operations (per 2014 QDR and GAO-14-801 Defense Planning report)<br />&bull; Develop capability to expand the use of Higher Data Rates to existing and emerging terminals and address additional Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) improvements and/or requirements <br />&bull; Explore technology developments for adapting/testing networking and more effective portable ground and lightweight airborne terminal components<br />&bull; Develop concepts and capabilities to enhance multispectral operations flexibility, increased spectrum efficiency, and integration of improved transmission components.<br />&bull; Develop enhanced, CDL-based ISR communications capabilities across multiple platforms and rapid prototyping efforts. <br />&bull; Support emerging communication backbone architecture development across space, air, and terrestrial layers; including agile high capacity data transport, assured communications, and multi-note access networks<br />&bull; Conduct studies and analysis to support current and future requirements documentation, program planning and execution <br />&bull; Develop and produce CDL prototype terminal designs that provide for future technology insertion and reduce non-recurring engineering and life-cycle costs to the user</p>
<p>Data Submission Requirements: The Government requests that potential contractors or contractor teams provide the following documentation.</p>
<p>1. A Statement of Interest (SOI) along with concepts and strategies to support the activities envisioned under a Common Data Link Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (CDL ID/IQ) for the DoD CDL community.<br />2. A Statement of Capabilities (SOC) describing their qualifications as a prospective contractor/prime contractor and 1st tier subcontractors. The Government will use information from the SOCs to determine how many contractors are currently capable of meeting the Government's requirements. <br />3. Identify past TDL experience and existing contracts with US government agencies under which their proposed services would be considered within scope and might be procured, including contact information for the current government contracting officers for such contracts.<br />4. Respondents are also asked to identify if your business is Large, Non-profit, Small, Small Disadvantaged, 8(a), Woman-owned Small Business, Service Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business, or HubZone Small Business under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code (specify NAICS code here using:<br />http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart=2007 ) with a size standard of (see size standards attached).</p>
<p>WRITTEN RESPONSE</p>
<p>The Government requests that interested offerors submit an electronic response in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat format in the form of a "white paper" of not more than ten (10) one-sided pages, 8.5" x 11" paper, 12 pitch font, with a minimum of one (1) inch margins all around. Any charts and/or brochures will not be included as part of the ten (10) pages. All responses must be unclassified. Responsible sources having relevant experience may submit their white paper, via e-mail to Edna Alonis, Contracting Officer, edna.alonis@us.af.mil no later than 4:00 PM (Eastern Time), 23 January 2015. Responses received after this date and time may not be reviewed.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP). Nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. AFLCMC will not release to any firm, agency, or individual outside the Government, any information properly marked with a proprietary legend without the written permission from the respondent. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this synopsis, nor will the Government compensate a respondent for any.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) is seeking sources to perform Non-Personal Services in support of the Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED) enterprise and the Military Healthcare System (MHS).
<p>The MHS licenses the use of Clinicomp International's (CCI) Essentris software as the MHS's Inpatient Electronic Health Record (EHR) solution. It is used in combination with the Composite Health Care System (CHCS) and Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA) to form the backbone of the MHS enterprise Electronic Medical Records systems. Navy Medicine's extensive utilization of CliniComp's Essentris EHR since 1987 has brought to light an issue regarding accessibility to critical patient information.</p>
<p>Patient mobility dictates a better way to access encounter data between DOD and VA health information systems. An evaluation of the Emergency Department pre-emptible clinical workflows and Essentris, which is a DOD DIACAP approved, electronic medical records system, was conducted and the determination made that some of the patient data disparity could be alleviated by leveraging the existing DoD-VA interagency solution known as the Bidirectional Health Information Exchange (BHIE) coupled with the development of the necessary asynchronous workflow complementary heuristics. BHIE is a proprietary, multi-agency, DIACAP certified system. The connectivity exists between DOD and VA health information systems.</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to provide clinicians better access to the data by developing effective data mining and mapping functionality.</p>
<p>The BHIE interagency system has developed the capabilities necessary to address many of the issues pertaining to the retrieval of clinical data from a wide range of sources for rendering by various solutions. Of note the BHIE solution currently captures comprehensive and reliable data accessibility from over 30 separate DoD data domains and 15 distinct data repositories. Coupling the implementation of novel workflow based logics with BHIE's integration of disparate DoD and VA health systems offers Navy Medicine's clinicians unprecedented workflow asynchronous patient data retrieval opportunities.</p>
<p>This sources sought notice is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for the requirement. Sources interested in responding to this notice are required to submit a capability statement that includes management and technical data and cost information, in sufficient detail and with convincing evidence that clearly demonstrates the capability to perform the required work. Capability statements shall not exceed 5 (8.5 x 11 inch) pages using a font size no smaller than 10-point. All capability statements received by the due date of this notice will be considered by the Government. A request for documentation or additional information will not be considered as an affirmative response. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed with a sole source contract.</p>
<p>Capability statements are due by 2:00PM local time, 5 January 2015. Capability statements shall be submitted by e-mail ONLY as a Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF attachment to the following address: NMLC-Research@med.navy.mil.</p>

If there is concern that the work area contains damaged elements that might appear as damage caused by the prosecution of the work, the contractor shall document the damage through memo or video tape the work area and provide a copy to the center prior to commencing any work.

<DESC>The International Trade Administration, Office of Enforcement and Compliance seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing both licenses and professional services in order to determine the capabilities of software vendors to help meet requirements of an Antidumping/Countervailing Duty (AD/CVD) Case Management System and Database (CMSD) for purposes of managing AD and CVD proceedings administered by the International Trade Administration's (ITA's) Enforcement and Compliance's (E&amp;C's) Office of AD/CVD Operations.
<p>After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for ITA's minimum requirements, ITA may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Contract. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: The current AD/CVD CMSD is designed in Lotus Notes (as a database) which contains legacy data dating back to 1970 along with current cases. Lotus Notes is no longer supported by ITA and the current AD/CVD CMSD no longer meets the current needs of E&amp;C. The goal of the new AD/CVD CMSD is to create a single system to capture and organize all case information necessary for analysts and management alike to effectively and efficiently manage and conduct AD/CVD proceedings. This system should provide a single point of data entry, flexible forms with which to track and report on case deadlines , and flexible reporting functionality that allows managers to produce reports that include real time information.</p>
<p>The new AD/CVD CMSD will be mostly used internally by E&amp;C Users. There is a need to display a very small portion of the data to the public on the internet. This portion must be updated in real time and be read-only for the public and available without a login to internet users. The information must be text searchable.</p>
<p>ITA is seeking a new AD/CVD CMSD solution with the ability to address a number of key requirements as well as take advantage of emerging technologies. A sampling of these requirements includes (described in detail below):</p>
<p>&bull; Case Management with robust date calculation/generation and data collection <br />&bull; User/Role-Specific Dashboard<br />&bull; Document Management, Routing\Workflow<br />&bull; Dynamic and Robust Reports/Queries <br />&bull; Administration and Management Tools<br />&bull; Real-Time Data Export to the Internet<br />&bull; Robust Search Capability<br />&bull; Menu-driven user interface<br />&bull; On-Demand Help and Reference Materials<br />&bull; Full Integration with Outlook email, calendar and tasks</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF REQUIREMENTS: ITA seeks to obtain specific information in writing from software vendors on their current capabilities to provide CMSD functionality in support of the following business requirements:</p>
<p>&bull; Manage and Track Case Information: Capture key information such as Case Number, Product, Country and Case Team Members. Produce due date schedules for nine different types of cases or "segments" of a proceeding. Most proceedings include approximately 100 different tasks and due dates which are tracked in reports, on calendars and, in some cases, displayed on the internet. Whenever possible, relevant information should be pre-populated.</p>
<p>&bull; Produce Complex Date Calculations: Calculate, update and retain all date and deadline information, including all deadlines used by management for performance measures for proceeding and segment. System should be able to handle complex date calculations for over 100 active cases and follow interface usability best practices.</p>
<p>&bull; Manage Subsets of Information: : Collections of detailed date information and documents should be easily tied to the larger case, shared among team members and easily included in reports.</p>
<p>&bull; User/Role-Specific Dashboard: Customizable templates for information display should be available which also tie into Outlook calendars and reporting formats.</p>
<p>&bull; Workflow: The solution should include full workflow functionality. Documents and document groups should be tracked to approvers and signatories and the dates and times of signatory or approver approval or rejection should be recorded. Documents should be associated with the relevant case. Document versioning is required. Workflow must be fully integrated with Outlook.</p>
<p>&bull; Reports/Queries: All reports and queries should be easily configurable to respond to changing requirements. Individual managers should be able to configure reports and queries for their needs, and reports should provide real-time information. Standard reports should be created as well as "one-off" reports or reports created "on the fly" for immediate short term needs. All data input should be available for retrieval into management reports including information collected in workflows and tasks.

<DESC>This Small Business Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for Market Research.<br /><br />
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service- disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 511120-Periodical Publishers.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM) is conducting a Market Survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs identified below:</p>
<p>Mission/Vision</p>
<p>Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) furthers the mission of NIH by emphasizing the critical role that behavioral and social factors play in health, health care and well-being. OBSSR serves as the focal point for coordination and development of NIH policies, goals, and objectives in the behavioral and social sciences at NIH. OBSSR is also a liaison between the NIH intramural and extramural communities, other Federal agencies, academic and scientific societies, national voluntary health agencies, the biomedical research community, the media, and the general public on matters pertaining to behavioral and social sciences research. OBSSR's vision is to bring together the biomedical, behavioral, and social science communities to work more collaboratively to solve the pressing health challenges facing our nation.</p>
<p>OBSSR's plan includes facilitating: (a) the next generation of basic behavioral and social science research; (b) transdisciplinary "team science" that integrates biomedical, behavioral and social-ecological perspectives; (c) research that integrates the systems and multiple levels of analysis - from cells to society - required to understand and model how individual, group, societal and contextual factors interact; and (d) the translation, implementation, dissemination and maintenance of best practices to strengthen the science of dissemination, put what is known into widespread practice, reduce the burden of chronic disease and help eliminate inequities in health and health care.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>In 2003, OBSSR spearheaded a bold scientific initiative to encourage the research community to answer the question: "What are the causal pathways/mechanisms that may explain the apparent positive statistical relationship between educational attainment and health?" As a result of this initiative, OBSSR funded thirteen (13) grants which directly contributed to dozens of original peer reviewed scientific papers on the subject of Education and Health. A history of the 2003 effort and its results can be found at:<br />http://obssr.od.nih.gov/scientific_areas/social_culture_factors_in_health/health_disparities/index.aspx</p>
<p>In 2014, OBSSR revisited the above question by convening a meeting of scholars and science stakeholders to summarize the lessons learned and possible new directions and unanswered questions that need to be addressed in order to improve the scientific understanding and advance the literature. A formal science report of that meeting can be read here: http://obssr.od.nih.gov/pdf/OBSSR_Education_and_Health_REV_8-22-2014_FINAL_RLA.pdf</p>
<p>The journal's open access will expand the leadership and possible research interest in the BSSR Education and Health research topic that spans both the behavioral/social sciences in addition to the clinical and health sciences.</p>
<p>Purpose<br />The purpose of the requirement is for a Contractor to assist OBSSR with providing Promotional Access of the Special Issue on Education and Health in the Journal of Social Science &amp; Medicine (SSM) to subscribers and non-subscribers of SSM. This effort will promote research excellence and knowledge development in this area of research which coincides with OBSSR's mission of facilitating the next generation of basic behavioral and social science research.</p>
<p>Impact of the Special Issue</p>
<p>SSM has an impact factor of 2.558, and is regularly in the top 25 read public health journals (http://www.journals.elsevier.com/social-science-and-medicine/). Open access to this special issue will also allow SSM and NIH to distribute the journal far beyond its normal circulation pattern.</p>
<p>Contractor Tasks</p>
<p>Specifically, the Contractor shall perform the following tasks:</p>
<p>&#9679; Provide promotional access of the Special Issue on Education and Health in the Journal of Social Science &amp; Medicine to subscribers and nonsubscribers of SSM for twelve (12) months<br /><br />Period of Performance</p>
<p>The Period of Performance shall be a twelve (12) month Base Period from the Date of Award.</p>
<p><br />The proposed acquisition will be procured in accordance with the policies and procedures under FAR Part 13. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which will be considered by the National Library of Medicine. This Sources Sought Notice is not a Request for Quotes (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available.</p>
<p>(a) Provide a capability statement demonstrating relevant experience, skills and ability to fulfill the Government's requirements for the above. The capability statement should contain enough sufficient detail for the Government to make an informed decision regarding your capabilities; however, the statement should not exceed ten (10) pages.</p>
<p>(b) The capability statement should include references, key personnel, and any teaming arrangements needed to fulfill the requirements. It must identify the responder's small business type and size; DUNS number; NAICS code; and technical and administrative points of contact, including names, titles, addresses, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses.</p>
<p>(c) All capability statements must be submitted electronically no later than 3:00 PM EST on Friday, December 19, 2014 to Sheila Edmonds at sheila.edmonds@nih.gov.</p>
<p><br />Disclaimer and Important Notes: This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. After a review of the responses received, a pre-solicitation synopsis and solicitation may be published in Federal Business Opportunities. However, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to a solicitation.</p>
<p>Confidentiality: No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s).</p>

<DESC>NOTE: This is an RFI, and, as such, is for informational and planning purposes only. This is NOT A solicitation or announcement for quotes or proposals. The Government will not reimburse vendors for any costs associated with providing information in response to this RFI or any follow-up information requests. The Government will not accept any telephone calls, or requests for a solicitation at this time. In order to protect the procurement integrity of any future procurement that may arise from this announcement, the Government will not provide information regarding technical points of contact. The Government will not make appointments for presentations. If interested, please see the Action Item section below for further instructions on how to respond to this RFI.
<p>PURPOSE:</p>
<p>Inform industry of a potential future requirement to isolate and sanitize Personally Identifiable Information/Federal Tax Information (PII/FTI) data located in Compuware's Workbench product offering.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>Composite processing is an important feature of File-AID Data Privacy and is designed to process data in a field and identify values within that data and disguise each part of the composite value appropriately. <br />SSA desires to utilize composite processing.</p>
<p>Composite Definition<br />Composite processing shall identify values within the source data value; these identified values are called data items. Each data item is identified independently based on the rules coded within the data item definition. Values can be identified as being a data item if they match a value in a list of values or a pattern in a list of patterns. Additional options allow data items to be identified as data that starts in a certain position, precedes or follows a value, has a specific length, etc.<br />The composite definition includes rules for processing a data field to locate the potential data items. Each composite definition is created to process a certain type of data value and shall be coded to locate whatever data is needed from the original data value.<br /><br />SSA has multiple data stores that contain Comment fields that have unsanitized data interspersed. This data will be Social Security Numbers (SSNs), Client Names, Employer Names, Addresses, Phone Numbers, Employer Identification Numbers (EINs) and Bank Account numbers. SSA has three translation tables that are used for translation of SSN, Name and Address. The translation tables and the data records contain an additional key field called CASE-SSN. This is used for translation. <br />For these data files, SSA would like to develop a mechanism to scan the Comment field, if present and replace strings that appear in the three translation tables for the matching Case-SSN.</p>
<p>Social Security Administration (SSA) uses the Compuware commercial off the shelf (COTS) products - Data Solutions and the new Workbench product - to isolate and sanitize Personally Identifiable Information/Federal Tax Information (PII/FTI) data, such as SSN, Bank Account numbers, phone numbers, email addresses and employer identification numbers (EINs). SSA has a need to modify the Compuware COTS software products to enhance the name and address santization capability.</p>
<p>SCOPE:</p>
<p>Compuware's Workbench processing shall be enhanced to provide the following functionality listed below.<br />The five requirements are defined below.<br />1. Variable list support<br />2. Composite rule logic<br />3. COMPRESS function<br />4. Legacy encrypt for character data<br />5. Call encrypt from custom function</p>
<p><br />Variable list support</p>
<p>This requirement shall add support for variable lists or arrays. A list of values is required when more than one value is to be processed using the same variable. Variable list support shall be available in rule logic, a new parameter types list of strings and list of numbers shall be available in custom functions.</p>
<p>Composite rule logic</p>
<p>The requirement SSA has is to process a comment field and disguise values within the comment that is almost exactly what composite processing was designed to handle. SSA has a need to change the values used to identify a data item each time the case changes. In addition, SSA needs to be able to process the source value prior to composite processing to compress excessive whitespace and handle punctuation variations, if needed.</p>
<p>COMPRESS function</p>
<p>A COMPRESS function is required to apply to the comment source the value prior to composite processing. This function would be coded to compress consecutive whitespace. If the compression is generic, the function should be written by the Contractor and included in the product.</p>
<p>Legacy encrypt for character data</p>
<p>SSA has been disguising EIN using the current File-AID/Data Solutions ENCRYPT. SSA would like to move from using imbedded criteria to using dynamic privacy rules. The requirement for making the transition successful is that the result of executing the new encrypt functionality shall be identical to the result SSA are currently getting from the imbedded rules. <br />This consistence is required because not all of the test data is refreshed at the same time due to each application being of different refresh cycles. The test data may contain data which was disguised by imbedded rules and data that is disguised by Dynamic Privacy Rules (DPR) and there cannot be any possibility of getting different values for the same source values since that could cause duplication of values already assigned. In all cases, the EIN is stored in a field defined as PIC X(9) and the File-AID/Data Solutions ENCRYPT technique is used. A field mask is also included to only encrypt the last 7 digits.</p>
<p>Call encrypt from a custom function</p>
<p>SSA has a requirement to call the legacy encrypt functionality described above in requirement number 4 from a custom function. The DPR technique for Encryption includes the option to use a custom encryption routine. The Contractor shall write a custom encryption routine to return consistent results that are currently achieved using the File-AID/Data Solutions ENCRYPT technique.</p>
<p>ACTION ITEM:<br />Interested parties believing they have the capability to offer suitable supplies and services must submit sufficient information (to include your business size status) to allow SSA to determine the availability and technical capability of qualified businesses with experience integrating and customizing one or more automated tools. In your capability statements, provide narrative responses (no more than 5 pages) addressing the bulleted items above, and information supporting your experience(s) and qualifications in previous work pertinent to this effort. Interested vendors must indicate if they are able to provide these services under an existing vehicle, such a through the General Services Administration's Federal Supply Schedules Program, other Governmentwide Agency Contract, or through other commercial sources.</p>
<p>Submit your responses via email to Alexandria Gordon, Contract Specialist, at Alexandria.Gordon@ssa.gov NO LATER THAN NOON, EASTERN STANDARD TIME ON December 22, 2014. Facsimile responses are not acceptable. Please reference SSA-RFI-15-0025 in the email subject line. The file size limitation for e-mail attachments is 5 megabytes.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT TO BE USED FOR MARKET ANALYSIS ONLY. NO AWARDS WILL BE MADE FROM THE RESPONSES TO THIS SYNOPSIS. NO SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS TO GAIN KNOWLEDGE OF POTENTIAL QUALIFIED CONCERNS DOING WORK UNDER NAICS 236220. ANY POTENTIAL COMPETITIVE SOLICITATION(S) THAT MAY PROCEED FROM THIS NOTICE WILL BE POSTED TO FEDBIZOPPS. ALL INTERESTED OFFERORS WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT AT A LATER TIME IF AND WHEN A SOLICITATION IS ISSUED. <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District, will use information obtained under this sources sought to develop a design and acquisition strategy to meet the requirements for the construction of the new FY16 DODEA Elementary School to be located at the U.S. Army Garrison, West Point, NY. <br> Currently, the US Army Corps of Engineers, in conjunction with the Department of Defense Education Activity (DODEA) is in the planning stages for a new two (2)-story, approximately 96,000 square foot elementary school with a school population of approximately about 500 students ( Pre-Kindergarten through the 4th Grade) to be located at the U.S. Army Garrison, West Point, NY. <br> One of the construction methods being considered for the project is the use of insulating concrete forms (ICF) for the building envelope. Insulating concrete forms (ICFs) are rigid plastic foam forms that hold concrete in place during curing and remain in place afterwards to serve as thermal insulation for concrete walls. The three basic form types are hollow foam blocks, foam planks held together with plastic ties, and 4' x 8' panels with integral foam or plastic ties. ICFs can be used to form various structural configurations, such as a standard wall, post and beam, or grid. They provide backing for interior and exterior finishes. <br> In order to consider the use of ICFs in the construction of the elementary school, the US Army Corps of Engineers seeks to determine the availability of experienced suppliers and contractors who have experience using this method of construction. <br> The market research survey seeks to identify industry's experience and capabilities to provide insulated concrete forms in the execution of this project. Interested Offerors shall respond to this Sources Sought Synopsis answering the questions in the attached questionnaire and providing information of at least two (2) relevant projects in which insulating concrete forms were used in the construction of the facility. <br> The anticipated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for this program is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction with a corresponding Standard Industrial Code (SIC) of 1542; and a Business Size Standard of $36.5 Million.    <br> A project will be considered relevant if it meets the following criteria: <br> Order of Magnitude: Projects with a construction cost greater than or equal to $10 million. <br> Size:  Two stories or greater and/or a square footage in excess of 50,000 GSF. <br> Project must have been completed within the last (7) years. <br> Offerors responding to this Market Research Synopsis shall be limited to information required above and shall be submitted no later than 1600 (4 pm) EST on 30 December 2014.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI)/Sources Sought notice issued in accordance with FAR 15.201(e) to conduct market research.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  The RFI does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future.  This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is not, at this time, seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested contractor's expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary.  All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.

The mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Information and Technology (OIT) is to develop and maintain IT products and systems that serve our Veterans by supporting the work of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), and the National Cemetery Administration.

The VHA is the largest integrated health care system in the United States; consisting of 150 medical centers and nearly 1,400 community-based outpatient clinics, community living centers, Vet Centers and Domiciliaries.  Together these health care facilities and the more than 53,000 independent licensed health care practitioners' who work within them provide comprehensive care to more than 8.3 million Veterans each year.

Within the VHA, the National Center for Ethics in Health Care (NCEHC) serves as the authoritative resource for addressing complex ethical issues that arise in patient care, health care management and research.  The NCEHC works with OIT to provide technology to empower patients and promote shared decision making through use of iMedConsentTM, a commercially-available software application that helps clinicians manage the informed consent process electronically.

VA requires the transformation of VA's existing iMedConsentTM client-server environment into a web-based platform fully integrated with the VistA enterprise health record, as well as compatible with existing IBM Health Care Pack enterprise messaging infrastructure (eMI) and Health Level Seven (HL7) automated data transfer protocols.  

VA is seeking interested parties that can meet this requirement.  Interested parties are requested to submit:  a capability statement demonstrating they can meet the specific requirements identified above; commercially available price information; and business size and socioeconomic status.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code considered is 519190, All Other Information Services.  Please indicate your business size and socio-economic status.  You may recommend another code if you deem it more appropriate.  Please provide your rationale.  

Submit responses via email to kari.cozzens@va.gov no later than 1:00pm Central Time December 19, 2014.

<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of Covidien/EV3 Cerebral Coil Extraction resources. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).<br /><br />This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 339113: Surgical Appliance and Supplies Manufacturing. Business size standard for NAICS 339113 is 500 employees. <br /><br />The proposed source is EV3 Inc., 3033 Campus Dr Ste 550, Plymouth, MN, 5544-2651. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received by Wednesday, 19 Dec 2014, 1200 EST. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br /><br />In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The Government requires Covidien/EV3 Cerebral Coil Extraction resources for future Cerebral Angiogram Coil Extractions which are necessary to prevent collateral damage to the brain.

<DESC>TITLE: RFI: Commercial Marketing and Sales Data
<p>OPDIV: FDA, Center for Tobacco Products (CTP)</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only, and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of FDA. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses, nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted for FDA's use of such information.  Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of FDA's evaluation of the information received. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this RFI or the Government's use of such information as either part of the evaluation process or for the development of specifications of a subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>On June 22, 2009, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (FSPTCA) was signed into law. This act gives broad authority to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to enact or facilitate tobacco product regulations, with the overall goals to (1) Prevent Americans - especially youth - from starting to use tobacco; (2) Encourage current users to quit; and (3) Decrease the harms of tobacco product use.<br />PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES<br />The Center for Tobacco Products (CTP), FDA is seeking information on the types and availability of US based tobacco product market surveillance datasets, nationally and by specific geographic regions, cities or states. The purpose of this RFI is to help FDA obtain knowledge of the datasets that monitor sales and advertising expenditures related to tobacco products that may currently exist in the commercial marketplace.<br />The objective of this RFI is to obtain declarations of technical capabilities and various information, data, and materials from qualified business concerns.</p>
<p>INFORMATION SOUGHT</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI shall discuss availability of dataset coverage of tobacco sales and advertising through traditional and  alternate channels (such as the Internet) including the availability of product specific data such as cigarettes, cigar, e-cigarettes, and smokeless products, and the availability of a breakdown of products, including brands and sub-brands, outlets/channels, geography represented and time frames available to track tobacco sales and advertising and timelines for reporting/delivery of new data.<br /> <br />Additionally, CTP is seeking information on the types of datasets for tobacco product sales by product type and outlet (e.g. online, specialty tobacco shops, convenience stores/other retailers), as well as tobacco product marketing or advertising expenditures by channel (e.g. online, print media, cable/television). The methodologies used to generate the data should be provided in response to this request.</p>
<p>Any response to this RFI or sample dataset provided should be well documented, and should include information about product categories, outlets/channels represented, and methods for obtaining the data. Information on the availability of a data dictionary should be noted in responses to this request. Details of technical support to accompany the datasets that is available to the FDA, may also be included in the response to this RFI.</p>
<p>All respondents are asked to indicate the type and size of your business organization, e.g., Large Business, Small Business, Veteran-owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, Hubzone Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-Owned Business, 8(a), Historically Black College or University/Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), educational institution, profit/non-profit hospital, or other nonprofit organization.</p>
<p>Interested parties capable of furnishing the information requested above may submit capability statements via email in Word or PDF format.  Responses shall be limited to 10 page, however any included sample datasets or data dictionaries shall not count against this limit. <br />Responses must be received not later than 3:00 PM Eastern Time, January 16th, 2015.. Capability statements will not be returned and will not be accepted after the due date.<br />Documentation should be emailed to: Christopher.McGucken@fda.hhs.gov</p>
<p>Disclaimer and Important Notes. This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed. Information provided will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for the potential requirement and may lead to the development of a solicitation. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted.</p>
<p>Any solicitation resulting from the analysis of information obtained will be announced to the public in Federal Business Opportunities in accordance with the FAR Part 5. However, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to a solicitation.</p>
<p>Confidentiality. No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s).</p>

<CONTACT>Robert Rahmer, Program Manager, Email dni-iarpa-baa-15-06@iarpa.gov
<DESC>The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) will host a Proposers' Day Conference for the Cyber-attack Automated Unconventional Sensor Environment (CAUSE) Program on January 21, 2015, in anticipation of the release of a new solicitation in support of the Program. The Conference will be held from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM EDT in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The purpose of the Conference will be to provide introductory information on CAUSE and the research problems that the Program aims to address, to respond to questions from potential proposers, and to provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities and identify potential team partners.
<p>This announcement serves as a pre-solicitation notice and is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  The Proposers' Day Conference does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts.  Conference attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to future solicitations (if any) associated with this Program.   IARPA will not provide reimbursement for any costs incurred to participate in this Proposers' Day.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND AND PROGRAM GOALS</p>
<p>Approaches to cyber defense typically focus on post-mortem analysis of the various attack vectors utilized by adversaries.  As attacks have evolved and increased over the years, established approaches (e.g., signature-based detection, anomaly detection) have not adequately enabled cybersecurity practitioners to get ahead of these threats.  This has led to an industry that has invested heavily in analyzing the effects of cyber-attacks instead of analyzing and mitigating the "cause" of cyber-attacks.</p>
<p>The CAUSE Program seeks to develop cyber-attack forecasting methods and detect emerging cyber phenomena to assist cyber defenders with the earliest detection of a cyber-attack (e.g., Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), successful spearphishing, successful drive-by, remote exploitation, unauthorized access, reconnaissance).  The CAUSE Program aims to develop and validate unconventional multi-disciplined sensor technology (e.g., actor behavior models, black market sales) that will forecast cyber-attacks and complement existing advanced intrusion detection capabilities.  Anticipated innovations include: methods to manage and extract huge amounts of streaming and batch data, the application and introduction of new and existing features from other disciplines to the cyber domain, and the development of models to generate probabilistic warnings for future cyber events.  Successful proposers will combine cutting-edge research with the ability to develop robust forecasting capabilities from multiple sensors not typically used in the cyber domain.</p>
<p>The CAUSE Program will consist of both unclassified and optional classified research activities and expects to draw upon the strengths of academia and industry through collaborative teaming.  It is anticipated that teams will be multidisciplinary and might include computer scientists, data scientists, social and behavioral scientists, mathematicians, statisticians, content extraction experts, information theorists, and cyber-security subject matter experts having applied experience with cyber capabilities.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION INFORMATION</p>
<p>Attendees must register no later than 6:00 pm EDT, January 14, 2015 at http://events.SignUp4.com/CAUSEPDRegistration_January2015. Directions to the Conference facility and other materials will be provided upon registration. No walk-in registrations will be allowed.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations, attendance will be limited to the first 250 registrants. All attendees will be required to present government-issued photo identification to enter the event. Non-U.S. citizens will be required to present passports.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>The afternoon will include unclassified Presentation and Poster sessions to provide an opportunity for attendees to present their organizations' capabilities and to explore teaming arrangements. Attendees who wish to present organization capabilities for teaming opportunities may submit a request through the registration website. Details on the presentation and poster formats, and the procedure for submitting a request to present, will be provided after approval to register for the Conference has been granted. Time available for presentations and posters will be limited. Therefore, presentations will be limited to the first 15 registered respondents who request an oral presentation, and posters will be limited to the first 15 registered respondents who request a poster presentation. These presentations are not intended to solicit feedback from the Government, and Government personnel will not be present during the presentations.</p>
<p>This Proposers' Day is intended for participants who are eligible to compete on the anticipated BAA. Other Government Agencies, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs), or any other similar organizations that have a special relationship with the Government, that gives them access to privileged or proprietary information, or access to Government equipment or real property, will not be eligible to submit proposals to the anticipated BAA nor participate as team members under proposals submitted by eligible entities. While such entities are not prohibited from attending the Proposers' Day, due to space limitations, preference will be given first to those organizations that are eligible to compete.</p>
<p>Questions concerning Conference and registration can be sent to dni-iarpa-events@iarpa.gov. Questions regarding the program can be sent to dni-iarpa-baa-15-06@iarpa.gov.</p>

<CONTACT>Christina J. Turner, Phone 2025518187, Email turnerc@sec.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intends to award a fixed-price purchase order on a sole source basis to Money Media for access to Ignites.com, FundFire.com, and BoardIQ.com. The contracting officer has determined that Money Media is the only source that can reasonably meet the SEC's requirement in accordance with FAR Part 13.501(a). Money Media's publications uniquely fill the requirement because Money Media's publications are copyrighted by Money Media, and are not available from any other source. They contain analysis and reporting created by Money Media's editors and authors in the specialty industry of mutual funds, mutual compliance and governance, and money management. The uniqueness of the information, combined with the copyright protection, makes Money-Media the only known source.
<p>The period of performance for the purchase order is anticipated to be a base year and two (2) one (1) year option years.</p>
<p>The SEC intends to award a purchase order to Money Media on or about December 22, 2014. This notice is not a competitive request for proposals. A competitive solicitation will not be issued. However, the government will give consideration to interested parties that identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals by the response date of this notice.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to award, on a sole source basis, a contract to MANE (Mabbett/Nobis Environmental JV).  This sole source contract is required for completion of the remaining scope of work to include additional post-remedial groundwater sampling defined in the task order listed below, issued to MANE (Mabbett/Nobis Environmental JV) under existing contract.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>52.212-4 -- Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items (May 2014)</p>
<p>Addenda to FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (May 2014):<br />The following clauses are addenda to FAR 52.212-4 - Commercial Items incorporated by reference:</p>

<p>The following clauses are addenda to FAR 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items incorporated in full text:<br />FAR 52.211-16 -- Variation in Quantity (Apr 1984)<br />(a) A variation in the quantity of any item called for by this contract will not be accepted unless the variation has been caused by conditions of loading, shipping, or packing, or allowances in manufacturing processes, and then only to the extent, if any, specified in paragraph (b) of this clause.<br />(b) The permissible variation shall be limited to:<br />10 Percent increase<br />10 Percent decrease<br />This increase or decrease shall apply to contract line item quantities specified in the delivery schedule. Shipments within the 10% clause must be in full unit of issue quantities.<br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>FAR 52.211-17 -- Delivery of Excess Quantities (Sep 1989)<br />The Contractor is responsible for the delivery of each item quantity within allowable variations, if any. If the Contractor delivers and the Government receives quantities of any item in excess of the quantity called for (after considering any allowable variation in quantity), such excess quantities will be treated as being delivered for the convenience of the Contractor. The Government may retain such excess quantities up to $250 in value without compensating the Contractor therefor, and the Contractor waives all right, title, or interests therein. Quantities in excess of $250 will, at the option of the Government, either be returned at the Contractor's expense or retained and paid for by the Government at the contract unit price. **NOTE: VENDORS ARE CAUTIONED IN THE USE OF A QUANTITY VARIANCE. DLA'S CURRENT PAYMENT SYSTEM RECOGNIZES NEITHER PARTIAL QUANTITIES NOR A QUANTITY IN EXCESS OF THE MAXIMUM VARIANCE PERCENTAGE SPECIFIED IN THE CONTRACT. THEREFORE, A QUANTITY VARIANCE NEEDS TO BE ROUNDED DOWN RATHER THAN UP IN ORDER TO BE PAID PROPERLY. FOR EXAMPLE, IF A VENDOR IS ALLOWED A PLUS OR MINUS 10% VARIANCE ON A QUANTITY OF 199, THE SYSTEM WILL ONLY ALLOW PAYMENT ON AN ADDITIONAL QUANTITY OF 19 OR LESS, NOT 20 (199 x .10 = 19.9). ADDITIONAL QUANTITIES IN EXCESS OF THE MAXIMUM VARIANCE MAY NOT BE ACCEPTED AND MAY BE RETRUNED TO THE CONTRACTOR AT THEIR EXPENSE.<br />(End of Clause)</p>

<p>(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute.</p>
<p>(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the Contractor (see Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the Contracting Officer, and approved at a level above the Contracting Officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal.

<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of Provision)<br />52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications -Commercial Items (Aug 2013)<br />An offeror shall complete only paragraphs (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certificates electronically via http://www.acquisition.gov.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product<br />Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:<br /><br /><br /><br />(2) Certification.

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.<br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly-<br />(1) [_] In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) [_] Outside the United States.<br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]<br />(1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [_] does [_] does not certify that-<br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;<br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and<br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.<br />(2) [_] Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)<br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).<br />(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN.<br />(3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).<br />[_] TIN:_____________________.<br />[_] TIN has been applied for.<br />[_] TIN is not required because:<br />[_] Offeror is a nonresident alien, foreign corporation, or foreign partnership that does not have income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and does not have an office or place of business or a fiscal paying agent in the United States;<br />[_] Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of a foreign government;<br />[_] Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government;<br />(4) Type of organization.<br />[_] Sole proprietorship;<br />[_] Partnership;<br />[_] Corporate entity (not tax-exempt);<br />[_] Corporate entity (tax-exempt);<br />[_] Government entity (Federal, State, or local);<br />[_] Foreign government;<br />[_] International organization per 26 CFR 1.6049-4;<br />[_] Other ____________________.<br />(5) Common parent.<br />[_] Offeror is not owned or controlled by a common parent:<br />[_] Name and TIN of common parent:<br />Name ____________________________________<br />TIN ______________________________________<br />(m) Restricted business operations in Sudan.

<p>Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is a United States government-owned corporation created in 2004, whose mission is to provide assistance that will support economic growth and poverty reduction in carefully selected developing countries that demonstrate a commitment to just and democratic governance, economic freedom, and investments in their citizenry. To receive assistance, eligible countries are required to enter into a public agreement (Compact) with the MCC that includes a multi-year plan for achieving shared development objectives and the responsibilities of each country in achieving those objectives, regular benchmarks to measure progress, multi-year financial plan, and a plan to ensure accountability for the use of MCA assistance.<br />SCOPE OF POSITION<br />This PSC position is located in the Department of Congressional and Public Affairs, Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), the mission of which is to communicate information about the Corporation activities, programs, compact results and policies; to engage the public, the private sector, and selected audiences including Congress, the news media, state and local governments, and other Federal agencies. <br />A personal services contract is different from non-personal services Government contract, which establishes an independent contract relationship. Under a non-personal services contract, the contractor or employees of the contractor are subject to the technical direction but not the supervision of the MCC. As defined by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37.104, a personal services contract is characterized by the employer-employee relationship it creates between the Government and the contractor personnel. Thus, the PSC is subject to the relatively continuous technical direction, supervision, and control of the MCC. PSCs may be assigned inherently governmental duties (see FAR 7.502). By law and by the contract's terms, the PSC is subject to most of the laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the direct hire employee such as MCC regulations, conflict of interest, under some circumstances MCC authorized employment security clearances, and financial disclosure. However, under the MCC personal services contract authority, PSCs are not employees for purposes of laws administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The following elements apply to this contact:<br />(1) Performance on site. <br />(2) Principal tools and equipment furnished by the Government. <br />(3) Services are applied directly to the integral effort of agencies or an organizational subpart in furtherance of assigned function or mission. <br />(4) Comparable services, meeting comparable needs, are performed in the same or similar agencies using civil service personnel. <br />(5) The need for the type of service provided can reasonably be expected to last beyond 1 year. <br />(6) The inherent nature of the service, or the manner in which it is provided, reasonably requires directly or indirectly, Government direction or supervision of contractor employees in order to- <br />(i) Adequately protect the Government's interest;<br />(ii) Retain control of the function involved; or <br />(iii) Retain full personal responsibility for the function supported in a duly authorized Federal officer or employee. <br />PLEASE NOTE: This contract shall be awarded solely to an individual, not to a firm. The individual must have an active DUNS # and a fully approved and active record in the System for Award Management (SAM).</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>"Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means-</p>
<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR. <br />(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to- <br />(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.</p>
<p>Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>The Department of Clinical Research Informatics (DCRI) is responsible for processes and systems that directly affect users in the care delivery and research settings. Work focuses on the analysis and evaluation of clinical research informatics needs and requirements, the development of design options that support the work processes of clinical research, and the implementation and management of responsive IT solutions.</p>
<p>The Investigational Drug Management System (IDMS) is a web application that is used by the Pharmacy Department to track all activities related to investigational drugs used in patients at the NIH, including prescription filling and investigational drug label generation.</p>

<RESPDATE>121714
<CONTACT>CHRISTIE MCCLOUD, Contract Specialist, Phone 757-605-7407, Email christie.mccloud@noaa.gov - Arthur A. Hildebrandt, Contracting Officer and Team Lead, Phone 7574416865, Email andrew.hildebrandt@noaa.gov
<DESC>The Eastern Region Acquisition Division (ERAD) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Norfolk, VA is soliciting quotes, on behalf of the National Weather Service's National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) for a vessel service to provide a transportation or towing vessel, crew, fuel, consumables, additional hawser, additional tag lines, and all materials required to retrieve the adrift NOAA 2.6-meter Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) buoy 2.6D73 and transport or town them both to an approved port in the United States in accordance with the attached Statement of Work (SOW), dated December 8, 2014.<br /><br />BACKGROUND:<br /><br />NOAA deployed buoy hull 2.6D73 at DART station 41420 (300 nautical miles North of San Juan Puerto Rico) on May 17, 2014.  The buoy broke free of its mooring on December, 2014 and drifted westward.  The photos below show a similar buoy anchored on station and one being hoisted.  The buoy is normally lifted from the "teacup handle" ring on the aluminum structure above the deck.  Appendix 1 shows the mooring diagram for 2.6D73.  The cause of the mooring failure is unknown, so the actual adrift buoy may have any of this mooring material (except the anchor) still connected to the bottom of the 4-leg bridle.  This mooring is one of three new moorings (less than 6 months old) that failed in 2014.  It is important to get the entire mooring back to help determine the cause of failure. &nbsp;<br /><br />The buoy contains acoustic transducers, transmitter, electronics and several hundred D-cell alkaline batteries for collecting data from a pressure sensor on the sea floor and transmitting it to a satellite.    &nbsp;<br /><br />The last position reported was   23&deg; 2.2'N, 68&deg;48.6'W on December 7, 2014 (150 nautical miles Northeast of Turks and Caicos Islands), traveling westward at 0.4 knots.  The buoy normally reports its position every 24 hours but can be set for more frequent reporting during retrieval.  The cause of the mooring failure is unknown, so the entire mooring, minus the anchor and bottom chain, could still be attached to the bottom of the buoy.  The most recent position of this buoy can be found at the following web site: <br /><br />http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/nws_special/41420.txt or by calling the Technical Contact for this SOW.<br /><br />Within 5 days of the buoys' arrival at the dock, NOAA will send two technicians to the docking location to check all buoy compartments for hazardous atmosphere (oxygen and explosive gases) and make the compartments safe to open and enter.  They will dismantle the buoy and prepare it for shipment back to Stennis Space Center, Mississippi.  This process will take approximately 1&nbsp;working days.  NOAA will pay the cost of transporting the buoy away from the dock.<br /><br />This is a best value, competitive requirement.&nbsp;The Government expects to award a firm fixed price contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest priced quoter with the highest technical score if the Contracting Officer determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government. <br />The following factors, which are listed in descending order of importance, shall be used to evaluate offers:<br /><br />(1)	Technical;<br />(2)	Past Performance; and <br />(3)	Price<br /><br />Factors 1 and 2, when combined, are significantly more important than price. <br /><br />The solicitation will be competed as a 100% total small business set-aside. The North American Industry Classification Code System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 483111, Deep Sea Freight Transportation. The small business size standard is 500 employees. NOAA anticipates awarding one firm fixed-price contract as a result of this solicitation. All responsible and fully responsive small businesses may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency. Any resulting contract will be awarded as a fixed-price contract. The response due date is December 17, 2014, at 4:00 PM ET.
<p>All responsible sources may submit a quote, which shall be considered by the agency. For information concerning this acquisition, please forward inquiries via e-mail to Christie McCloud, Contract Specialist, at Christie.Mccloud@noaa.gov or via telephone at (757) 605-7407. <br /><br />Companies offering a response to this notice shall ensure that they are registered in the System for Award Management (SAM), www.sam.gov, prior to submission of proposals. All vendors doing business with the Government are required to be registered with the SAM. NO award shall be made unless the vendor is registered in SAM. For additional information and to register in SAM, please access the following web site: https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. In order to register with the SAM and be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors shall also have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number. A Dun &amp; Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet on-line at: http://www.dnb.com/ or by phone at (800) 333-0505. This procurement also requires offerors to file veteran employment reports at http://www.dol.gov/vets/programs/fcp/main.htm.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.)

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>1352.209-73 Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) <br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p><br />1352.209-74 Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2014)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: <br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and <br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

Therefore, any subsequent protest to GAO must be filed within 10 days of knowledge of initial adverse agency action. <BR> <BR>USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM ? STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (1)   The offeror?s past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System ? Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier?s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier?s past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier?s overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
1.  Dark Blue:Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group* 2.  Purple:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 3.  Green:Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group* 4.  Yellow:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 5.  Red:Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier?s percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating. <BR> <BR>Due to the interrelationship of supplies and/or services to be provided hereunder, the Government reserves the right to make a single award to the offeror whose offer is considered in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered.  Therefore, offerors proposing less than the entire effort specified herein may be determined to be unacceptable. <BR> <BR>1)   Award under this procurement will be made to the technically acceptable quote/offer which is most advantageous to the Government, price and past performance considered.
2)   Technically Acceptable - In order to be determined technically acceptable, offers must meet or exceed the specifications, delivery requirements, and other terms and conditions in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  If applicable, offers must also meet the requirements of FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal.   The offer must be determined to be technically acceptable before further consideration.
3)   Price - Evaluation of price will include the following:
(  )Single Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled "Single Award for All Items". (  )Split Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled ?Evaluation of Offers for Split Awards?. (  )Transportation costs per FAR 52.247-__@@___. (  )Evaluation of Options per FAR 52.217-__@@__.
4)   Past Performance - Evaluation of past performance will be based on information obtained from PPIRS-SR as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  A quote/offer with a low PPIRS-SR rating (red or yellow for quality and/or less than a 70 weighted delivery score) may not represent the most advantageous quote/offer to the Government. <BR> <BR>F.O.B.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract. The COR is located at: ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ Phone Number:____________________ E-mail:____________________ (b) The responsibilities and limitations of the COR are as follows: (1) The COR is responsible for the technical aspects of the contract and serves as technical liaison with the contractor. The COR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all deliverables and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the contract. (2) The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the contract price, terms or conditions. Any contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COR. No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may designate assistant or alternate COR(s) to act for the COR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the contractor. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>Insert clause 1352.239?70, Software License Addendum, in all contracts when the primary purpose is to purchase new software licenses or renew existing licenses.

(f) Invoices: Invoices will be handled in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. Section 3903) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A?125, Prompt Payment.

(c) Alternatively, offerors may propose products and services that provide equivalent facilitation. Such offers will be considered to have met the provisions of the Access Board standards for the feature or components providing equivalent facilitation. If none of the offers that meet all applicable provisions of the standards could be accepted without imposing an undue burden on the agency or component, or if none of the offerors propose products or services that fully meet all of the applicable Access Board's provisions, those offerors whose products or services meet some of the applicable provisions will be considered eligible for award. Awards will not be made to an offeror meeting all or some of the applicable Access Board provisions if award would impose an undue burden upon the agency. (d) Offerors must submit representation information concerning their products by completing the VPAT template at http://www.Section508.gov . <BR> <BR>Insert a clause substantially similar to 1352.246?70, Place of Acceptance, in contracts and solicitations to indicate where the acceptance of supplies and/or services will take place.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.

In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2).

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO FAR PROVISION 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>I. EVALUATION FOR CONTRACT AWARD: The Government plans to award a single contract resulting from this solicitation IAW FAR 13.106-3 to the responsible offeror whose quote/offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered (Past Performance).</p>
<p>II. The Government intends to evaluate and award without establishing a competitive range, conducting discussions, and scoring quotations/offers. Therefore, the offeror's initial quote/offer should contain the offeror's best quotation/offer. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, etc. if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.</p>
<p>III. Past Performance:</p>
<p>A. Past Performance will be rated as either "Acceptable" or "Unacceptable" using the ratings and descriptions in the table below.</p>
<p>Rating Description</p>
<p>Acceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Unacceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br /><br />B. Past performance may be based on one or more of the following:</p>
<p>i. The Contracting Officer's knowledge of and previous experience with the supply or service being acquired;<br />ii. Customer surveys and past performance questionnaires; <br />iii. The Governmentwide Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at www.ppirs.gov; or<br />iv. Any other reasonable basis.</p>
<p>IV. Price:</p>
<p>A. The total evaluated price of a proposal will be calculated as the sum of the extended prices (unit quantity multiplied by unit price) for all Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs). Prices will be submitted using the format in Attachment 3, Pricing Schedule. The CLIN structure for award purposes is stated above.</p>
<p>B. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for the option years to the total price for the basic requirement. The Option to Extend Services Clause, 52.217-8, will also be evaluated using the pricing from the last option year. If the option to extend services under 52.217-8 is used, prices are only adjusted if the Secretary of Labor revises the wage rates and the contractor requests an increase due to the change in labor rates. The six-month extension period per FAR clause 52.217-8 is used only in circumstances listed in FAR 37.111. If option is exercised, a CLIN will be added via modification.</p>
<p>C. The Contracting Officer has determined there is a probability of adequate price competition in this acquisition. Upon examination of the initial offers, the Contracting Officer will review this determination and if, in the Contracting Officer's opinion, adequate price competition exists, no additional cost/price information will be requested. However, if at any time during this competition the Contracting Officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists, offerors may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of price.<br /><br />V. LATE SUBMISSIONS, DEBRIEFINGS, AND NOTICE OF AWARD:</p>
<p>Late proposals will be processed in accordance with FAR 52.212-1(f) "Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers." <br />(End of provision)</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center"><strong><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">Qualification Requirements (Feb 1995)</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(a)<em> Definition. </em>"Qualification requirement," as used in this clause, means a Government requirement for testing or other quality assurance demonstration that must be completed before award.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(b) One or more qualification requirements apply to the supplies or services covered by this contract. For those supplies or services requiring qualification, whether the covered product or service is an end item under this contract or simply a component of an end item, the product, manufacturer, or source must have demonstrated that it meets the standards prescribed for qualification before award of this contract. The product, manufacturer, or source must be qualified at the time of award whether or not the name of the product, manufacturer, or source is actually included on a qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list. Offerors should contact the agency activity designated below to obtain all requirements that they or their products or services, or their subcontractors or their products or services, must satisfy to become qualified and to arrange for an opportunity to demonstrate their abilities to meet the standards specified for qualification.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(Name) <span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thanh Van D Nguyen, OC-ALC Corrosion Program Manager</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(Address) <span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><a href="mailto:van.nguyen@us.af.mil">van.nguyen@us.af.mil</a> </span></p>
<p><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(c) If an offeror, manufacturer, source, product or service covered by a qualification requirement has already met the standards specified, the relevant information noted below should be provided.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">Offeror's Name _______________________________</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">Manufacturer's Name __________________________</span></p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">Test Number ______________________________ (to the extent known)</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(d) Even though a product or service subject to a qualification requirement is not itself an end item under this contract, the product, manufacturer, or source must nevertheless be qualified at the time of award of this contract. This is necessary whether the Contractor or a subcontractor will ultimately provide the product or service in question. If, after award, the Contracting Officer discovers that an applicable qualification requirement was not in fact met at the time of award, the Contracting Officer may either terminate this contract for default or allow performance to continue if adequate consideration is offered and the action is determined to be otherwise in the Government's best interests.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(e) If an offeror, manufacturer, source, product or service has met the qualification requirement but is not yet on a qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list, the offeror must submit evidence of qualification prior to award of this contract. Unless determined to be in the Government's interest, award of this contract shall not be delayed to permit an offeror to submit evidence of qualification.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(f) Any change in location or ownership of the plant where a previously qualified product or service was manufactured or performed requires reevaluation of the qualification. Similarly, any change in location or ownership of a previously qualified manufacturer or source requires reevaluation of the qualification. The reevaluation must be accomplished before the date of award.</span></p>

At the end of the contract, the above mentioned deliverables shall become property of the Government. <BR> <BR>The Government will use the best value-tradeoff source selection process, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.101-1 (Tradeoff Process).  
Award will be made to the offeror: 
1.	Which is deemed eligible; 2.	Which is deemed responsible; 3.	Whose proposal conforms to the solicitation?s requirements; and 4.	Whose proposal is determined to provide the best value to the Government.  
The proposal offering the best value is the one that is most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Such an offer may not necessarily be the one offering the lowest price or receiving the highest non-price rating.
For this solicitation, all evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  Award will not be automatically determined by numerical calculation or formula relationship between the non-price factors and price.  As non-price factors, when combined, become more equal, the evaluated price rises in importance and may become the determining factor.
The Contracting Officer will determine what trade-off between the non-price factors and price promises the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered. <BR> <BR>The Government intends to make award without discussions on the basis of initial proposals received.  However, the Government may elect to make award with discussions if it is determined to be in the Government?s best interest.
If the Government elects to make award with discussions, it reserves the right, before requesting a final proposal revision, to:
1.	Limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals;
2.	Make more than one competitive range determination;
3.	Conduct more than one round of discussions; and
4.	Conduct more than one round of proposal revisions. <BR> <BR>Factor 1:  	Management Approach. Factor 2:  	WORK PLAN/STAFFING Factor 3:       PAST PERFORMANCE
See attached SOW for additional information. <BR> <BR>The government will evaluated the contractors price build up for each labor category described in Section B to include all cost elements ,  (i.e., base labor rated, fringe, G&A, overhead, profit  etc.) to determine that price is fair and reasonable. <BR> <BR>The Government will evaluate offers for contract award purposes by adding the total proposed price for all option periods to the total proposed price for the base periods in Section 8.  ? <BR> <BR>The estimated completion date for this task order is 180 days after date of award. <BR> <BR>NAICS Code: 541990 <BR> <BR>

DFARS Clause 252.204-7000: Disclosure of Information (August 2013) <BR> <BR>FedBid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government. Attempts to file protests through FedBid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). It is preferable that protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 
No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:
(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or (2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.
Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint. [AFARS Revision #25, Item XIII, dated April 1, 2010] <BR> <BR>IAW 52.212-1(g Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids) The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror?s initial offer should contain the offeror?s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <BR> <BR>Please contact the following for any concerns regarding the solicitation and/or award of this requirement: Stacey Swader Contracting Officer MICC - Fort Riley Com: (785) 239-4825 Email: stacey.l.swader.civ@mail.mil <BR> <BR>Under FAR Part 12 Streamlined Procedures for Commercial Acquisitions, a debrief is not required. The Government will not offer a debrief for this requirement. <BR> <BR>Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is ?late? and may not be considered IAW with 52.212-1(f). At any time during and/or closing of the solicitation, all clarifications, discussions, or changes (as applicable) will be conducted ONLY by the Contracting Officer, MICC Fort Riley, Kansas. Any correspondence (electronic or verbal) presented to the vendor marketplace during the solicitation period by the FEDBID Staff, to include Quality Assurance, will be rejected by the Contracting Officer. No FEBBID correspondence will be accepted by MICC Fort Riley without prior coordination and approval from the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items.

Wherever the words "offer", "proposal", "offerors", or similar terms are used in this solicitation, they shall be read to mean "quote", "quotation", "quoter", ?vendor? or similar corresponding term to reflect that this solicitation is a Request for Quotations, not a Request for Proposals or an Invitation for Bids. <BR> <BR>Quotes must be submitted per unit price.  Multiple awards will not be made; therefore, quotes that cover less than all the items and quantities in this solicitation will be rejected as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>New equipment/parts only.  No remanufactured products. <BR> <BR>In order to enhance the efficiency of the procurement process, the Government intends to evaluate only the lowest priced quote to determine if the quote is technically acceptable and whether the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance.  If the lowest priced quote is reasonably priced and technically acceptable and the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance, the Government intends to make an award to that vendor and no other quote will be evaluated.  If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not have acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance.  This method will continue until the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote, by a vendor with acceptable or neutral past performance, is determined. Quotes will be evaluated based on price and technical acceptability.  Quoter certifies that the product quoted meets or exceeds all minimum requirements as stated in the Request for Quotes. <BR> <BR>FAR 52.211-6 -- Brand Name or Equal is incorporated into this solicitation and any subsequent awards.

(1) Meet the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristic specified in this solicitation; (2) Clearly identify the item by? (i) Brand name, if any; and (ii) Make or model number; (3) Include descriptive literature such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference to previously furnished descriptive data or information available to the Contracting Officer; and (4) Clearly describe any modification the offeror plans to make in a product to make it conform to the solicitation requirements. Mark any descriptive material to clearly show the modification. (c) The Contracting Officer will evaluate ?equal? products on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. (d) Unless the offeror clearly indicates in its offer that the product being offered is an ?equal? product, the offeror shall provide the brand name product referenced in the solicitation. <BR> <BR>Quotes must be submitted per unit price and total price.  Multiple awards will not be made; therefore, quotes that cover less than all the items and quantities in this quote will be rejected as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>The contract price includes all applicable Federal, state, and local taxes and duties. <BR> <BR>FOB Destination CONUS (Continental U.S.) <BR> <BR>The contractor shall stamp or mark the supplies delivered or otherwise furnish notice with the supplies of the existence of a warranty.  Markings shall include (i) a brief statement that a warranty exists, (ii) the substance of the warranty, (iii) its duration, and (iv) who to notify if the supplies are found to be defective. <BR> <BR>THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS PROVIDED TO ASSIST YOU, AND WILL HELP TO EXPEDITE PAPERWORK AND PAYMENT.
     a. Only one delivery will be accepted against each line item.  Backorders will NOT be accepted on individual line items.     b. Deliver on or before date specified.  Deliveries will be accepted Monday through Friday (except Holidays) from 7:30 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. to Block 15 of the Purchase Order.

Put packing list inside cartons.  Show the order number assigned, the PR number shown at the end of each item, and the quantity shipped.  All items will be identified by the part number by attached tag and/or stamped identification.     d. On direct shipments, have the supplier or manufacturer cite our order number on packages.  This eliminates delay caused by trying to determine the firm awarded the original order. <BR> <BR>Unless otherwise specified in this contract, the contractor shall obtain any necessary licenses and permits, give all notices, and comply with any applicable Federal, State, County, and municipal laws, codes, and regulations in connection with this award. <BR> <BR>The contractor shall not make news releases or otherwise provide information relative to the performance of this contract or information relative to any incident occurring on JBLM without prior approval of the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>NOTICE:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take six months before your offer is evaluated. 
 
GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

Please note that SIN 51-508, Litigation Support Service is revised to include paralegal support, eDiscovery and FOIA request requirements.

Please note that SIN 51-507, Destruction Services contains specifications and requirements for the destruction of unclassified and classified material types.  Offerors shall comply with the specifications and requirements for the type of materials proposed for destruction.

For information on how to obtain digital certificates per DUNs number, please see the following link:  http://eoffer.gsa.gov/eoffer_docs/DigitalCert.html

<DESC>Proposal Prep Instructions
<p>The Contractor must submit with their quote the following:<br />&bull; Dun and Bradstreet Number (DUNS);<br />&bull; Verification of Contractor Registry System (CCR) Registration www.ccr.gov; <br />&bull; technical approach; and<br />&bull; price quote.</p>
<p>Technical Plan Instructions</p>
<p>The Contractor must submit a technical plan and price quote for this requirement to the Contract Specialist / Contracting Officer cited herein.</p>
<p>The total number of pages, (combination of technical plan and price quote) is not expected to exceed 30 pages in length, excluding resumes. The Contractor shall submit its quote electronically in a "read only" format.</p>
<p>A detailed work plan must be submitted indicating how each aspect of the statement of work is to be accomplished. Your technical approach should be in as much detail as you consider necessary to fully explain your proposed technical approach or method. The technical plan should reflect a clear understanding of the nature of the work being undertaken. The technical plan must include information on how the project is to be organized, staffed, and managed. Information should be provided which will demonstrate your understanding and management of important events or tasks.</p>
<p>Plans which merely state that the tasks will be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the Government's scope of work will not be eligible for further consideration. The schedule contractor must submit an explanation of the proposed technical approach in conjunction with the tasks to be performed in achieving the project objectives.</p>
<p>The technical plan shall include:</p>
<p>&bull; An overview of the company (if applicable)<br />&bull; Resumes of all professional individuals proposed for the contract. Resumes should be no longer than 2 pages in length<br />&bull; Project Management Summary.<br />&bull; An outline of quality control procedures</p>
<p>Technical Plan Format</p>
<p>The suggested outline for the technical plan is as follows:</p>
<p>The technical proposal should clearly demonstrate the Offerors capabilities, knowledge, and corporate capability and experience related to furnish a consultant as described in the Statement of Work. The technical proposal should be in as much detail as is considered necessary to provide straightforward, concise delineation of the approach the Offeror will use for accomplishing the work and how the project is to be managed and staffed. Stating that the Offeror understands and will comply with the technical specifications is not adequate. Similarly, phrases such as standard procedures will be employed or a well-known technique will be used are also inadequate.<br /><br />Personnel</p>
<p>Describe the experience and qualifications of personnel who will be assigned for direct work on this project. Information is required which will show the composition of the task or work group, its general qualifications, and recent experience with similar equipment or programs.<br />ARTICLE 14 - Past Performance</p>
<p>An evaluation of schedule contractors' past performance information will be documented prior to any communications with the schedule contractor. However, a past performance evaluation will not be conducted on any schedule contractor whose quote is not eligible for further consideration.</p>
<p>The evaluation will be based on information obtained from references provided by the schedule contractor, other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government, and any information supplied by the schedule contractor concerning problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective action taken.</p>
<p>The government will assess the relative risks associated with each schedule contractor. Performance risks are those associated with a schedule contractor's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that schedule contractor's record of past performance.</p>
<p>The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be a product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of a schedule contractor's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers relevant information.</p>
<p>When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the schedule contractor as it relates to all acquisition requirements, such as the schedule contractor's record of performing according to specifications, including standards of good workmanship; the schedule contractor's record of controlling and forecasting costs; the schedule contractor's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the schedule contractor's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the schedule contractor's business-like concern for the interest of the customer.</p>
<p>The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, sources of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the schedule contractor's performance.</p>
<p>The lack of a relevant performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the schedule contractor.<br />The schedule contractors shall submit the following information as part of their technical plan.</p>
<p>A list of the last three (3) task orders and / or contracts completed during the past three (3), years and the last three (3) delivery or task orders and / or contracts awarded currently in process that are similar in nature to the RFP's work scope. Delivery or task orders and / or contracts listed may include those entered into by the Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments and commercial concerns. Schedule contractors that are newly formed entities without prior delivery or task orders and / or contracts should list contracts and subcontracts as required above for all key personnel.</p>
<p>Include the following information for each delivery or task orders and / or contracts or subcontracts:</p>
<p>1. Name of Contracting Organization;<br />2. Contract Number (for subcontracts, provide the prime contract number and the subcontract number);<br />3. Contract Type;<br />4. Total Contract Value;<br />5. Description of Requirement;<br />6. Contracting Officer's Name and Telephone Number;<br />7. Program Manager's Name and Telephone Number; and<br />8. North American Industry Classification System(NAICS) Code</p>
<p>The schedule contractor may provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the schedule contractor's corrective actions.</p>
<p>Each schedule contractor will be evaluated on its performance under existing and prior contracts for similar products or services. The Government is not required to contact all references provided by the schedule contractor. Also, references other than those identified by the schedule contractor may be contacted by the Government to obtain additional information that will be used in the evaluation of the schedule contractor's past performance.</p>
<p>Price Quote Instructions</p>
<p>The Contractor shall submit a price quote for each task(s) or subtask(s) as specified in the Statement of Work and for each year of the requirement, including a summary of the costs for the entire period of performance.</p>
<p>The price quote shall indicate the applicable direct labor categories with the negotiated fixed hourly rates (time).</p>

The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>Insert a clause substantially similar to 1352.246?70, Place of Acceptance, in contracts and solicitations to indicate where the acceptance of supplies and/or services will take place.
As prescribed in 1346.503, insert the following clause: Place of Acceptance (APR 2010) (a) The Contracting Officer or the duly authorized representative will accept supplies and services to be provided under this contract. (b) The place of acceptance will be:NOAA SHIP PISCES GULF MARINE SUPPORT FACILITY 151 WATTS AVENUE PASCAGOULA, MS 39567 <BR> <BR>

If a project was performed by a joint venture, and all joint venture partners are not on the team proposed for this contract, the firm should specifically address the work performed by the joint venture partner teaming on this contract. Likewise, if the team member worked as a subcontractor on a project, the description should clearly describe the work actually performed by the team member and the roles and responsibilities of each on the project, rather than the work performed on the project as a whole.

Destination Only. <BR> <BR>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<a href="mailto:adam.j.elmore@us.army.mil">ACC - Rock Island (ACC-RI)</a>
<DESC>This procurement includes two NAICS codes: 332993 and 561210.    <br>    <br>  The U.S Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI) 61299-8000 and the U.S. Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ) 07806-5000 on behalf of the U.S. Army Joint Munitions Command (JMC) located at Rock Island Arsenal, IL and the Project Director for Joint Services (PD JS) and the Project Manager for Combat Ammunition Systems (PM CAS) both located at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, are currently seeking interested sources from within the National Technology and Industrial Base (NTIB) for property management and operation of the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP) combined with the associated production at SCAAP of 155mm M795 steel projectile and 120mm mortar steel shell bodies.   <br>    <br>  SCAAP is located in Scranton, PA and is a Government-Owned, Contractor-Operated (GOCO) facility for the manufacture of large caliber artillery and mortar steel shell bodies to be used as components of conventional ammunition.  The SCAAP facility is comprised of 8 buildings over 15.3 acres, which includes 495,000 square feet of manufacturing space and 36,000 square feet of administrative space.  The Government is in the process of implementing a cost effective solution at SCAAP to deliver large caliber steel shell bodies more efficiently at lower volumes while preserving surge capability.   <br>    <br>  The Government anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) that will include requirements for the property management and operation of the SCAAP, with an accompanying RFP (as an attachment) for the production of the 120mm Mortar Cartridge family steel shell bodies and M795 steel projectile bodies.  Interested parties will be required to propose on both the property management and operation of the SCAAP, as well as the production of the above steel projectile and shell bodies.  Proposals submitted against the RFPs will be evaluated collectively as a best value competition, limited to the NTIB.  Award of both contracts is planned in the FY16/FY17 timeframe.  <br>    <br>  The steel projectile and shell bodies to be produced at SCAAP under this anticipated solicitation are required for the 155mm, M795 High Explosive (HE) and the 120mm Mortar Cartridge family.  The contractor will be required to produce the steel projectile and shell body for each item listed below.  A description of the M795 and 120mm Mortar Cartridge family projectile and shell bodies follows.      <br>  The M795 has a hot forged steel projectile body made from High Fragmentation steel alloy, HF-1, is approximately 30 inches long with a welded overlay brass band, and has a finished weight of approximately 75 lbs.    <br>    <br>  The M933A1/M934A1 High Explosive (HE) Cartridge's hot forged steel shell body is 120mm in diameter, approximately 16 inches long with a weight of approximately 20 lbs.  <br>    <br>  The shell body for the M931 Full Range Practice (FRP) Cartridge matches the M934A1 in size, shape and weight.  <br>    <br>  The M929 White Phosphorous (WP) Smoke Cartridge's hot forged shell body is 120mm in diameter, approximately 16 inches long with a weight of approximately 20 lbs.    <br>    <br>  The M930 Visible Light (VL) Illuminating and M983 Infrared (IR) Cartridge utilize a 2-piece steel shell body.  The front shell body is approximately 10 inches long and 20 lbs while the rear shell body is approximately 8 inches long and weighs approximately 5 lbs; both halves are 120mm in diameter.    <br>    <br>  The property management and operation period of performance will cover an initial five (5) year period of time, with additional option-periods (total duration not to exceed 15 years) that may be awarded at the discretion of the Government.  The production of steel projectile and shell bodies will cover an initial five (5) year period of time with additional option-periods (not to exceed 10 years total) that may be awarded at the discretion of the Government.    <br>    <br>  ACC-RI will administer the award of the property management and operations for the SCAAP facility (Property Management Contract) resulting from the award decision.  ACC-NJ will administer the award for the steel shell bodies to be produced at the SCAAP facility (Production Contract), also resulting from the award decision.  Anticipated quantities of artillery projectiles and mortar shell bodies range from 547,000 to 631,000 in total over the first 5-year period.    <br>    <br>  In order to be flexible during changing Defense budgets, companies will be asked during the RFP phase to provide a plan that includes alternative ways to manage and operate a production facility and produce steel shell bodies.  No less than three (3) years after award of both contracts (Property Management and Production), the Government may decide to implement the company's plan in whole or in part.  At this time, the Government envisions the company's plan may include: implementing additional efficiency improvements at SCAAP to lower cost of ammunition production and/or utilization of a production site other than SCAAP while preserving the SCAAP facility/capabilities.      <br>    <br>  In response to this market survey, companies shall provide their qualifications and experience necessary to manage and operate SCAAP and produce the items listed in this market survey.  Companies are advised to provide the property management information in one document, and the production of steel projectile and shell bodies information in another document.  Relevant qualifications and experience related to property management and operation of a large scale manufacturing facility include: capabilities, methodology, processes, skills, and other supporting data.  Relevant qualifications and experience related to production of large caliber steel shell bodies and/or forged projectile metal parts, include: unique production capabilities, processes, skills and plan to meet any capabilities, skills, etc. which are not yet in place to produce the items.  Information provided should include organizational structure and key personnel trained and qualified to manage and operate a facility and to produce large caliber metal parts.   <br>    <br>  If you are contemplating any arrangement with a major/key source (defined as over 20% of the total effort), please identify that source and identify the type of arrangement contemplated (i.e. teaming, partnership or subcontract).    <br>    <br>  Additionally, the Government requests that industry provide recommendations to be considered in forming the acquisition strategy.  For example, this may include information on requirements cost drivers or suggested terms and conditions to support a business arrangement, (i.e., contract type, length, economic price adjustment (EPA) commodities, etc.).    <br>    <br>  The U.S. Army owns SCAAP industrial plant and equipment and all of the facility's real property, as well as the intellectual property (IP) for the production processes and tooling/gauges/dies for the aforementioned items.  The intellectual property and Technical Data Packages for the various Metal Parts are not being provided under this Market Survey.  The awardee may use the IP and/or the SCAAP Government Furnished Property (GFP), to include the tooling/gauges/dies, at their discretion.     <br>    <br>  The Government encourages the use of SCAAP's idle or underutilized facilities for commercial and third party work as authorized under the Armament Retooling and Manufacturing Support (ARMS) agreements in accordance with 10 USC 4551- 4555  quote mark ARMS Initiative quote mark .  If you plan on utilizing the ARMS initiative, please identify the extent of that intended effort and how it will benefit the Government.  <br>    <br>  The Government anticipates conducting Industry Day(s) in the near term and actual dates will be announced under a separate Special Notice at a future time.   <br>     <br>  Interested sources within the NTIB should respond by providing the Government the following information:  (1) Name of company and CAGE code; (2) Point of Contact's name, telephone number and E-mail address; (3) Company address; (4) Business size information (please specify your business as Large, Small, Small Disadvantaged, 8(a), Woman-owned Small, Historically Underutilized Business Zone concern, Veteran-owned, or Service-disabled); and (5) Brochures/literature.

<DESC>The Government intends to solicit and award through full and open competition, several Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for the purpose of procuring Manpack Radios for the Full Rate Production (FRP) phase of the program.  Manpack Radios will enable communications through seamless, high speed and digital information exchange across both vertical and horizontal hierarchies within the battlespace that supports ground, airborne and maritime domains. The Manpack Radio will support all domains for dismounted and mounted communications as a multi-functional communications platform. The Manpack Radio will provide two independent, multi-waveform channels as a software defined radio with an embedded Selective Availability Anti Spoofing Module (SAASM) to enable radios to transmit their locations to external host applications.      <br>             <br>      The current Manpack Radio requirements are stated in the Capability Production Document (CPD) for Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Version 2.4 dated 5 April 2012 and approved on 20 May 2012.  The Government intends to procure existing and Non-Developmental Items that meet the Manpack Radio capabilities as described in the PRD.      <br>            <br>      The purpose of this RFI is to survey the ability of vendors' anticipated offerings for the Full Rate Production Manpack Radio to meet proposed changes to CPD mission weight, battery life, and range requirements.  Interested sources are encouraged to provide responses to the attached Request for Information (RFI).   This is a completely voluntary questionnaire intended to guide the Government when planning final performance requirements for the Manpack.        <br>                  <br>      This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Final Solicitation or a promise to issue a Final Solicitation in the future. This notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Furthermore, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this notice; all costs associated with responding to this notice will be solely at the interested parties' expense.  Not responding to this notice does not preclude participation in any future Final Solicitation, if issued.        <br>            <br>      If a Final Solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.  It is the responsibility of the potential responder to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.  If your company is interested in this planned procurement, then it is advised that you monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at HTTP://WWW.FBO.GOV.       <br>            <br>      The above discussed intent is subject to change.       <br>          <br>     ---Change 1---      <br>           <br>     The purpose of this change is to provide an updated Manpack Radio request for information document for proposed CPD changes.  The updates are included in the newly added Section 3 Proposed CPD Mission Weight Detail.  Submission instructions remain unchanged from the original announcement.    <br>        <br>     ---Change 2---      <br>        <br>    The purpose of this change is to extend the submission date and revise the submission instructions for responses to the proposed CPD requirements changes.    <br>        <br>    All questions/comments pertaining to the document posted today shall be submitted no later than November 7, 2014, 12 PM ET to matthew.j.connolly1.civ@mail.mil.  Questions/comments should be in MS Office 2007 or Adobe PDF formats.  E-mail messages shall be less than 10 MB in size.  If larger files are submitted, they must be broken into separate e-mail messages.  Reference W15P7T-15-R-0004 in the e-mail subject.  All communications SHALL be submitted ONLY in writing AND directly to the email addresses identified.  Contractors shall not contact any other Government Personnel other than the person identified above.  Contacting any Government personnel other than the individual identified above could result in an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) and could result in an offeror being excluded from competition and/or award.      <br>            <br>    All communications SHALL be submitted ONLY in writing AND directly to the email addresses identified.   <br>      <br>   ---Change 3---   <br>      <br>   The purpose of this change to this announcement is to conduct a new Request for Information (RFI) for the Full Rate Production Manpack Radios. Please note that this new RFI is separate from the initial RFI posted under this announcement for solicitation number W15P7T15R0004 regarding changes to CPD requirements, which is still in effect.   <br>      <br>   The purpose of this RFI is to survey the ability of vendors' anticipated offerings for the Full Rate Production Manpack Radio to integrate onto Government specified vehicle mounts including the AN/VRC-116 Single Manpack Tray Assembly, the AN/VRC-117 Dual Manpack Tray Assembly, and the Project Manager Tactical Radios (PM TR) Manpack Universal Tray.  This is a completely voluntary questionnaire intended to guide the Government when planning final performance requirements for the Manpack.  The results of this survey are non-binding, and will be considered proprietary information, not to be shared outside of Governmental personnel.   <br>      <br>   Please see the attached document entitled  quote mark Vehicle Integration RFI quote mark  for details about the information the Government is requesting for this RFI.   <br>      <br>   To assist in responding to this RFI the Government will provide, at request, specification documents for the vehicle mounts. To obtain a copy of these specification documents, send a request via email to matthew.j.connolly1.civ@mail.mil. Include  quote mark Manpack Vehicle Integration RFI - W15P7T-15-R-0004 quote mark  in the subject line of the email request. Additionally, only U.S. Citizens shall request these specification documents and the email request for the specification documents shall provide verification that the individual requesting the documents is a U.S. Citizen.

Due to the file size of the specification documents, the documents will be provided through AMRDEC Safe Access File Exchange (https://safe.amrdec.army.mil/safe/).  These specification documents will not be available for request after the date and time established below for the submission of responses to this RFI.   <br>      <br>   Responses to this RFI shall be submitted no later than November 12, 2014, 12 PM ET to matthew.j.connolly1.civ@mail.mil. Responses should be in MS Office 2007 or Adobe PDF formats. E-mail messages shall be less than 10 MB in size. If larger files are submitted, they must be broken into separate e-mail messages. All communications SHALL be submitted ONLY in writing AND directly to the email addresses identified.

<DESC>Question and Answer Two (2)   <br>  Amendment #5 updates the Performance Work Statement (PWS) by adding the section 5.3 Areas to be Cleared, clarifies federal/contractor holidays and adds the revised Pricing Schedule.  <br>    <br>  Q3 - Would it be permissible to place storage containers to store sidewalk salt and small equipment at the salt domes (or other location) at both the Aberdeen and Edgewood areas?  <br>    <br>  A3 - DPW will provide a location for a storage container at the salt dome for each area. The contractor will be responsible for locking and removal at the end of the snow season. The Government offers no surveillance.   <br>    <br>  Q4 - Would it be permissible to place an above ground fuel tank for fueling small equipment at the salt domes (or other location) at both the Aberdeen and Edgewood areas?  <br>    <br>  A4 - No above ground fuel tanks. The contractor will be responsible for the fueling of equipment and vehicles.  <br>    <br>  Q5 - If the area is subjected to multiple snow events it may become necessary to load and transport snow by truck to the approved stockpile locations. This work would entail additional cost to the contractor over and above the costs associated with clearing a specific depth of snow.  Are we to anticipate the potential for this to occur and incorporate those costs into the bid items presently provided or will an additional bid item be added specifically to cover loading and transport of snow?  <br>    <br>  A5 - Line 14 is added to the bidders list for this requirement.  <br>    <br>  Q6 - How will instances of freezing rain be dealt with when plowing is not required but salt is? (We believe this to be in reference to the way the contractor will get paid.)  <br>    <br>  A6 - This will have to be paid under a 0 quote mark  to 2 quote mark  CLIN.  <br>    <br>  Q7 - Will the contractor be required to wait for a call prior to mobilizing or will the contractor be allowed to mobilize and begin work as (s)he sees fit?  <br>    <br>  A7 -The contractor will be contacted and will have a two hour response time beginning at that phone call.  <br>    <br>  Q8 - How will the contractor be compensated in the event of a government delay in providing/loading of road salt?  <br>    <br>  A8 -The Government will have personnel on site at all snow events.  <br>    <br>  Statement - The fenced areas of 3090 and 3200 presently contain a significant quantity of vehicles and equipment in the secure area.  <br>    <br>  Q9 - Can the 90% clear requirement be reduced in these locations to allow for areas made inaccessible by these obstructions?  <br>    <br>  A9 - Yes, For Building 3090 there is no requirement for snow removal inside the fenced in area.  <br>    <br>  Q10 - Please clarify the access arrangements for the secure areas to the rear of E-3400 in Edgewood and the fenced areas at 3090 & 3200 in Aberdeen.  <br>    <br>  A10 - All secured areas at Aberdeen and Edgewood will be confirmed by the Contracting Officers Representative (COR) prior to access.   <br>    <br>  Q11 - There is a Parking lot arm at 5100, will that be open during snow plow operations.  <br>    <br>  A11 - Yes, the arm will be open during snow events.  <br>    <br>  Q12 - The 6000 Complex, are the interior walks and court yard all part of this proposal, or is it done by housekeeping.  <br>    <br>  A12 - The interior court yard shall be completed by the contractor and is included in section 5.3, area description to be cleared, of the Performance Work Statement (PWS). Maps displayed during the site visit were for reference only.

A determination by the Government to proceed with any future resulting acquisition as a set-aside is within the discretion of the Government. <strong>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) notice is to survey the vendor community for potential sources that can provide nationwide Regulated Waste Management services to all 56 field offices and 380 resident agency facilities (see http://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field) within the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Specifically, the FBI wishes to determine the availability of a single Contractor, having the necessary in-house resources OR the ability to obtain the required experience and skills through partnerships with other vendors through subcontracting efforts. Alternatively, if a Contractor's service coverage area is limited, therefore, is unable to provide nationwide coverage, the Contractor may submit a response to this RFI clearly identifying the region(s) it can service (e.g. by state).</p>
<p><strong>Scope:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The FBI generates a small amount of hazardous and medical wastes on a periodic basis. A comprehensive listing of the potential regulated waste is unavailable. Occasionally, emergency spill response support is required at the 56 field offices. A call center is desirable to assist the FBI in determining if a material is a hazardous waste, and how to handle and store it prior to pick-up.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The desire is for the contractor to provide all labor, supervision, supplies, and equipment necessary for the safe and proper removal and disposal of regulated waste while ensuring compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations. Regulated waste includes but is not limited to the following: hazardous waste, non-hazardous waste chemicals, occasional evidence waste (e.g. drug evidence), medical waste (e.g. sharps, biohazard wastes). Municipal solid waste and recycling (e.g. paper, plastic, glass, etc.) is NOT included in this requirement.<br /><br /><strong><br />Format, Delivery Date, and Point of Contact:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is requesting feedback in the form of technical capabilities, questions, and comments or suggestions related to the information contained within this RFI notice. All interested parties are invited to submit in writing, by the closing date indicate below for receipt of responses below, a capabilities package entitled "[Insert Company Name] Response to RFI DJF-15-RFI-Regulated Waste Management". Responses shall not exceed 15 pages, TOTAL.</p>

<DESC>This is modification 3 to the synopsis entitled Collaborations for Commercial Space Capabilities which was originally posted July 17, 2013. <p> NASA intends to issue an Announcement soliciting proposals from all interested U.S. private enterprises that wish to enter into Space Act Agreements (SAA) for collaboration on emerging commercial space capabilities on or about March 31, 2014.  The purpose of the agreements is to advance entrepreneurial space-related efforts by facilitating access to NASAs vast spaceflight resources including technical expertise, assessments, lessons learned, technologies, and data.  With this activity, NASA intends to focus on facilitating the development of integrated space capabilities, not individual technologies or subsystem development efforts.	NASA plans to use its other transactions authority within the National Aeronautics and Space Act, 51 U.S.C.  20113(e), to enter into multiple SAAs where each party bears the cost of its participation, and there is no exchange of funds between the parties.  The SAAs resulting from this solicitation will serve as an agency-level mechanism for NASA and its partners to agree to a series of mutually beneficial activities that are expected to be consistent with NASAs 2014 Strategic Plan. There must be specific, identifiable benefits to one or more elements of Strategic Goal 1, Objective 1.1 to expand human presence into the solar system and to the surface of Mars to advance exploration, science, innovation, benefits to humanity, and international collaboration. The goal of the SAAs is to advance private sector development of integrated space capabilities so that the emerging products or services are commercially available to government and non-government customers within approximately the next five years.  NASAs Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) is engaging in several initiatives to enable industry partnership opportunities such as the Lunar Cargo Transportation and Landing by Soft Touchdown Announcement (Solicitation Number: Lunar-CATALYST-01) and the Asteroid Redirect Mission Broad Agency Announcement (Solicitation Number: NNH14ZCQ002K). This Collaboration activity is an additional opportunity to partner with NASA and is not intended to preclude ongoing or future partnership discussions directly with NASA Centers or Mission Directorates.  Entities with existing SAAs with NASA Centers or Mission Directorates are not required to respond to this Announcement to retain those SAAs.  Participation in one initiative does not preclude participation in any of the others.  Companies are free to interact with NASA in any or all of the initiatives that support their organizations goals. <P> NASA will only consider proposals from U.S. private enterprises (including non-profit organizations) or commercial providers as defined by the Commercial Space Act of 1998. There may be future opportunities for the private sector to submit proposals to NASA for these types of agreements after the initial selections are made. <P> Potential participants are responsible for monitoring the Internet website listed above for the release of the Announcement for Proposals and for downloading their own copy of the Announcement and amendments.  Proposals shall be submitted in two parts.  Part 1 will be an Executive Summary due approximately three weeks after release of the solicitation. NASA will notify each company whether its Executive Summary was among those most favorably evaluated.  If so, the company shall have the opportunity to submit part two, a full proposal due back to NASA approximately three weeks after notification.  The award of one or more SAAs is planned for summer 2014. <p> NASA plans to conduct a pre-proposal teleconference on April 3 to discuss this activity and answer questions. For more information on this Announcement and the teleconference, visit <A HREF="http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/ccsc/">http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/ccsc/ </A>	   . <p> Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 01  <br> Posted: 16 December 2014 <br>  <br> Please note Amendment 01 represents new information deviating from original notification. Changes are as follow: <br>  <br> Date changed to: 08 January 2015 <br> Registration changed to: 8:30 AM <br> Location changed to: 12000 Research Parkway, Orlando Fl 32826 <br> Room changed to: 304 A and B <br> One-on-Ones changed to: 12000 Research Parkway,Orlando Fl 32826 Room 304 A/B <br> ************************************************************************************Original Notification: <br>   <br> The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Program Manager Constructive Simulations (PM ConSIM) is conducting market research to assist in developing an Acquisition Strategy (AS) for the Intelligence & Electronic Warfare Tactical Proficiency Trainer (IEWTPT) contract to support the Product Manager (PdM) Warrior Training Integration (WTI) mission.   <br>      <br>   This effort is for continued analysis, design, development, integration, testing, security accreditation, installation, fielding, modifications, system support, and training support of the IEWTPT training capability - including associated simulation interfaces to complementary programs - and the Human Intelligence (HUMINT) Control Cell (HCC) configuration of IEWTPT.  The current Technical Control Cell (TCC) is a processor  quote mark server stack quote mark  that creates a realistic, relevant target environment for high-fidelity training on Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems supporting training in multiple intelligence disciplines such as: All Source, Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), including Communications Intelligence (COMINT) and Electronics Intelligence (ELINT); Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT);  Counterintelligence/Human Intelligence (CI/HUMINT); and Open Source Intelligence (OSINT).     <br>      <br>   The TCC has three (3) enclaves: the Lower Enclave (LE) (SECRET collateral), the Cross Domain Solution (CDS) (a.k.a. Data Diode), and the Upper Enclave (UE) (Top SECRET (TS)/Sensitive Compartmentalized Information (SCI).  In addition to realistic simulation data, it provides exercise control and support tools, authoring tools and scenario development capabilities, and AAR functions. The TCC has the capability to distribute the exercise simulations/ stimulation information to local/ closed networks and, in some instances, remote training locations via secure Joint/ Army networks.  The current HCC is an interactive, avatar based simulator created for HUMINT Soldiers and used by multiple Army disciplines to sustain tactical questioning skills.  The soldier can run through any number of multiple scenarios available, questioning virtual humans in a free flowing (non-scripted), realistic virtual environment in an attempt to extract mission-essential information.     <br>      <br>   IEWTPT supports individual and/ or collective intelligence sustainment training by leveraging the Live, Virtual, Constructive - Gaming training environment capabilities and generating and/or augmenting and providing simulation-born data feeds to  quote mark real world quote mark  systems. IEWTPT is expected to transition to a cloud-based solution in the near future.  The planning and prototyping has begun for a cloud-based HCC capability. The IEWTPT system is fielded to multiple CONUS and OCONUS locations.   <br>      <br>   Additional information describing the IEWTPT programs can be found on the U.S. Army PEO STRI PM ConSim website, http://www.peostri.army.mil/PRODUCTS/IEWTPT/   <br>      <br>   An Industry Day-Market Research Meeting is scheduled for 09:00.A.M - 5:00 P.M. on 9 January, 2015 to provide information about this requirement.   <br>      <br>   The meeting will be held in Partnership III (P3), Room 321 A/B, located at 3039 Technology Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826.    <br>      <br>   To ensure adequate space is available, organizations are limited to three (3) representatives (3 representatives inclusive of prime and sub per team). Organizations wishing to participate shall pre-register by providing the names and contact information (e-mail and telephone number) of their representatives and one alternate via email to the Technical POC no later than 02:00 PM, 05 January 2015.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 01 <br> Dated 16 December 2014 <br> This amendment supresedes any previously posted information. <br>  <br> Project:  Intelligence & Electronic Warfare Tactical Proficiency Trainer (IEWTPT) Re-compete <br>  <br> Notice Type:  SPECIAL NOTICE   <br>  <br> Brief Description: The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Program Manager Constructive Simulations (PM ConSIM) is conducting market research to assist in developing an Acquisition Strategy (AS) for the Intelligence & Electronic Warfare Tactical Proficiency Trainer (IEWTPT) contract to support the Product Manager (PdM) Warrior Training Integration (WTI) mission. <br>  <br> This effort is for continued analysis, design, development, integration, testing, security accreditation, installation, fielding, modifications, system support, and training support of the IEWTPT training capability - including associated simulation interfaces to complementary programs - and the Human Intelligence (HUMINT) Control Cell (HCC) configuration of IEWTPT.  The current Technical Control Cell (TCC) is a processor  quote mark server stack quote mark  that creates a realistic, relevant target environment for high-fidelity training on Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems supporting training in multiple intelligence disciplines such as: All Source, Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), including Communications Intelligence (COMINT) and Electronics Intelligence (ELINT); Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT);  Counterintelligence/Human Intelligence (CI/HUMINT); and Open Source Intelligence (OSINT).   <br>  <br> The TCC has three (3) enclaves: the Lower Enclave (LE) (SECRET collateral), the Cross Domain Solution (CDS) (a.k.a. Data Diode), and the Upper Enclave (UE) (Top SECRET (TS)/Sensitive Compartmentalized Information (SCI).  In addition to realistic simulation data, it provides exercise control and support tools, authoring tools and scenario development capabilities, and AAR functions. The TCC has the capability to distribute the exercise simulations/ stimulation information to local/ closed networks and, in some instances, remote training locations via secure Joint/ Army networks.  The current HCC is an interactive, avatar based simulator created for HUMINT Soldiers and used by multiple Army disciplines to sustain tactical questioning skills.  The soldier can run through any number of multiple scenarios available, questioning virtual humans in a free flowing (non-scripted), realistic virtual environment in an attempt to extract mission-essential information.   <br>  <br> IEWTPT supports individual and/ or collective intelligence sustainment training by leveraging the Live, Virtual, Constructive - Gaming training environment capabilities and generating and/or augmenting and providing simulation-born data feeds to  quote mark real world quote mark  systems. IEWTPT is expected to transition to a cloud-based solution in the near future.  The planning and prototyping has begun for a cloud-based HCC capability. The IEWTPT system is fielded to multiple CONUS and OCONUS locations. <br>  <br> Additional information describing the IEWTPT programs can be found on the U.S. Army PEO STRI PM ConSim website, http://www.peostri.army.mil/PRODUCTS/IEWTPT/ <br>  <br> An Industry Day-Market Research Meeting is scheduled for 09:00.A.M - 5:00 P.M. on 8 January, 2015 to provide information about this requirement. (8:30 A.M. registration begins) <br>  <br> The meeting will be held in 12000 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826. Room 304 A and B.  <br>  <br> To ensure adequate space is available, organizations are limited to three (3) representatives (3 representatives inclusive of prime and sub per team). Organizations wishing to participate shall pre-register by providing the names and contact information (e-mail and telephone number) of their representatives and one alternate via email to the Technical POC no later than 02:00 PM, 05 January 2015. Foreign Nationals may not attend this event.   <br>  <br> Attendees will also have the opportunity to participate in  30-minute one-on-one sessions following the government's presentation.  When pre-registering, please indicate your firm's desire to participate in a one-on-one session. Based on the number of interested parties, your firm's point of contact will be notified of your scheduled 30-minute one-on-one discussion with members of the Government project team. The one-on-one sessions will be held in 12000 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32828. Room 304 A and B from 1300 - 1700 on 8 January 2015. <br>  <br> All questions will be captured during the sessions and answers to all questions will be posted to FedBizOps for the general public. <br>  <br> NOTE: <br>  <br> DISCLAIMER:  The information provided in this notice is subject to change and is not binding on the Government.  This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject services. No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this notification.  The Government will use the information received to forge its acquisition strategy.  Additionally, all submissions become government property and will not be returned.  No basis for a claim against the Government shall arise as a result from a response to this RFI. <br>  <br> Contracts POC: Aurora Ramirez, (407) 208-3495, aurora.i.ramirez2.civ@mail.mil <br> Technical POC: Frank Lozito, (407) 208-5659, fank.lozito.civ@mail.mil <br>

<DESC>Amendment to add the description.
 
In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3, Request for Information for Solicitation and Planning Purposes (October 1997), this notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). The Department of the Interior (DOI)/U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) intends to assess the responses to inform its decision-making. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to contract for services. The government will not pay for any information provided as a result of this notice and will not recognize or reimburse any cost associated with RFI submission. Responses to this RFI will not affect a potential offeror's ability to respond to any RFP that might follow. Please ensure that any sensitive or protected information is marked as such and the government will ensure this information is not released externally. The overarching objective for this RFI is information gathering and not development of possible government acquisition of products or services.

The Government has a need for a service that allows searching of indexed peer-reviewed science journal articles along with value-added information describing how often the research articles have been cited. USGS scientists currently use the Web of Science / Science Citation Index Expanded, a product of Thomas Reuters content. This product has been acknowledged as the standard for benchmarking the impact of peer-reviewed science journal articles.

Thomson Reuters (Scientific) Inc. is the sole source provider of Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded) and the Web of Knowledge (WOK) platform is the only known source for this information. The Web of Knowledge Platform is a proprietary database platform only available from Thomson Reuters. Their product is the only known suite of products combining evaluated content with tools to use, analyze and manage this content directly from the desktop. Additional tools available include EndNote Web, a citation management software (EndNote Web) embedded in the WOK platform that makes it easy to create bibliographies and manage citations; Journal Citation Reports which tracks the impact of journals by subject area; and ResearcherID, which is used to assign unique identifiers for scientists, making it easier to resolve name conflicts among scientists.

Web of Science - Science Citation Index Expanded is a true cited reference index and includes over 8,300 major journals across 150 disciplines, with archive data to the year 1900. The Web of Science contains a broad range of disciplines including chemistry, mathematics, physics, medical and life sciences, biological sciences, engineering, environmental science, materials science, computer and information science, and agriculture. 

Thomson Reuters content indexes a subset of peer-reviewed, authoritative journals that are critical to science disciplines, which makes for more effective searching. Irrelevant websites and nonprofessional journals are excluded from their index. The WOS product developed the bibliometric methodologies that are used to evaluate article and research impact, and the Journal Citation Report impact factors are used by science programs to facilitate benchmarking.

The Web of Science includes the following features:
	Author cited references are captured for ALL full journal articles indexed, 1900 to present. 
	Times Cited links are a standard feature within the Web of Science for all articles, 1900 to present.
	Over 857,000,000 cited references, from 1900 to present, have been indexed.
	Web of Science captures 65 million cited references every year 
(to articles in journals covered and not covered)
	Data is quality controlled, so cited references within a multitude of formats are unified to a standard.
	Largest citation database available and  only true cited reference index. 
	Cover-to-cover indexing, including full papers and reviews, editorial material, book reviews, etc.
	Complete citation coverage from 1900.
	65 million cited references captured every year.
	Indexing of 100% of available cited references.
	Journal Selection Process applied consistently across 3300+ publishers.

 Interested concerns who believe they have the capability to provide the required services as defined are invited to submit a Capability Statement, not to exceed 10 pages.  Responses should also include the following information:  company name, address, point of contact, email address, business type, and approximate cost information (i.e., rough order of magnitude).  Past performance information should be submitted for projects of this nature conducted within the last three (3) years.  

To notify the Government of sensitive information, data identified as Proprietary [e.g., 41 USC section 423, the Procurement Integrity Act restrictive legend per Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-1)] contained in a response to this RFI, offerors shall mark the cover page of the response and each affected page of the response with indications that it contains proprietary information.  The Government assumes no liability for the disclosure or use of information contained in a response if it is not marked proprietary.

Please submit all responses and any questions to this notice by Wdenesday, December 17, 2014, via email to the Contracting Officer, Meridith Potts, at mpotts@usgs.gov.  Responses received after this date will not be evaluated.  No feedback or evaluations will be provided regarding the information provided.

<SUBJECT>58--WALRUS IMPLANTABLE TAG DEVELOP. SERVICES
<SOLNBR>G15PS00089
<NTYPE>PRESOL
<CONTACT>Caravelli, Jeffrey
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Surveys walrus research program at the Alaska Science Center in Anchorage, AK has been radio-tagging walruses for decades to better understand the species movement patterns, behavior, and habitat associations.  Most of the tags that are currently used for this research are satellite tags, which are attached to the walrus with a sub-dermal anchor and deployed remotely with a crossbow.  Retention times, and consequently data collection times, of external tags retained by anchors imbedded in the blubber and skin of walruses tend to not exceed 3 months and average considerably less.  One probable reason is the forces applied to the retention mechanisms by the external part of the tag as tagged walruses rub the tag against other walruses, ice, and the ground at terrestrial haulouts.  We believe a tag completely implanted in the skin and blubber layer will significantly increase retention times.  

We are requesting services for the development of an implantable ARGOS satellite linked location transmitter for walruses, and optional services for a deployment method by crossbow (preferably) or airgun (alternatively) from at least 10 meters.  Ideally the tag will be less than 6cm (excluding the antennae) in length, the approximate depth of the combined skin and blubber layer of the intended implantation location.  Our primary goal is to improve retention time, to at least three (3) months.  Battery life, transmission schedules, and transmission data should accommodate this longevity and provide data to help determine the cause of tag failure.  We expect the contractor will work closely with USGS researchers to develop the tag and are willing to undergo a few rounds of testing and development.  
We require two (2) mockups for development/testing of a tag deployment system by 15 February 2015, five (5) working tags for deployment (with optional tag deployment system) by 01 May 2015, and an additional five (5) revised (as necessary) tags for deployment on 15 August 2015.  These dates are targets only and will be negotiated upon the receipt of quotations and before award.

Full specifications and evaluation criteria will be released with the request for quotations (RFQ).  The RFQ will be set aside for participation by small business concerns, and issued in accordance with the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Parts 12 (acquisition of commercial items) and 13 (simplified acquisition procedures).  
The applicable product/service code is 5820, radio and television communications equipment, except airborne.  The applicable NAICS code is 334220, radio and television broadcasting and wireless communications equipment manufacturing, with corresponding size standard 750 employees.  We anticipate the RFQ will be available the week of 29 December 2014.

Please direct any questions or concerns to the Contracting Officer, Jeff Caravelli, via email at jcaravelli@usgs.gov.

The contractor will also be required to repair, maintain and provide start-up and shut-down inspections of Dining Facility equipment including, but not limited to, convection ovens, deep fryers, hot food tables, commercial reach-in refrigerators and freezers and roof mounted exhaust fans.  <br>  Services are required Monday through Friday from 0700 to 1630, except for federal holidays. All work under any resulting contract shall be performed at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, WA and only facilities on Fort Lewis-Main and Fort Lewis-North are included.   <br>  The solicitation will be issued as 100% Set-Aside for Small Business concerns.

<DESC>***This RFI remains open until close of business on Friday, December 19, 2014.  The purpose of this modification is to post questions and answers (Q&As) for all to see.***

Introduction

This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this RFI will be the outcome of a competitive process.  

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Technology Acquisition Center (TAC) is seeking potential sources to enter into a contract for Live Streaming Conference Support and License Software.

The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified contractors who are able to meet VA's requirements, determine if commercial items are available or could be modified to meet VA's requirements, determine the appropriate contract type i.e., firm fixed-price or cost-reimbursement or time and material, understand commercial pricing practices and other market information readily available.


Background

The VA TAC sponsors an Advanced Planning Brief to Industry (APBI) one-day conference on a yearly basis.  The objective of the APBI is to brief industry on information technology (IT) acquisition opportunities and Department initiatives. 

This conference is held at an off-site location which limits the amount of attendees.  The Live Streaming Conference Support and License Software project will utilize available tools that will enable the VA TAC to improve attendance through live streaming of the event through a software license and event support. 


Requirements

Utilize a web-based user-friendly software live-streaming solution that will allow for 1,000 online viewers of the event.  The event will consist of live speakers and PowerPoint slide presentations.  Both shall be broadcasted to the target audience. 

3 administrative licenses to support setup and running of the meeting.

Software shall not be hosted on VA infrastructure.

Software shall be viewable by Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari and Chrome browsers.  Viewers shall not be required to download client software.

Software shall require viewer registration (Name, Company) to provide for viewer accountability prior to the event.  Additionally, if the event link is forwarded to another participant, they shall be required to register.  Registration form fields shall be customizable.

Software shall provide 5 separate "chatrooms" for viewers to enter and chat online amongst themselves.  These rooms shall be named by the event administrator.  Chat logs shall be downloadable after the event concludes.

Software shall provide a method for collecting questions from online viewers. 

Event Management Support is required for pre-event support and on-site support the day of the event to perform all activities necessary to successfully run the event.  Event Management Support shall include all IT/Video equipment required to stream the event (the venue will provide local equipment such as audio out, microphones and projection to perform the live event).

After the event has concluded, the recording shall be available for download by VA to distribute as necessary.


Submittal Information

It is requested that interested contractors submit a response (electronic submission) of no more than 5 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum that addresses the above information.  In response to the RFI, interested contractors shall submit the following information by close of business on December 19, 2014.

1.	Capabilities/Qualifications - Description of the capabilities/qualifications/skills your company possesses to perform the work.

2.	Teaming Arrangements - Description of Teaming Partners, Joint Ventures that your company would consider to perform the work.

<DESC>The United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Care Administration, Network Contracting Office (NCO) 17 is hereby publishing a notice of intent to award a sole source contract to C R Associates, Inc. located at 8580 Cinderbed Road, Suite 2400, Newington, VA 22122, a large business.  The North Texas Veterans Health Care System located in Dallas, Texas has a current community Based Outpatient Clinic to provide primary medical care services and ancillary medical care services to veteran patient beneficiaries within the local Bridgeport, Texas catchment area.  Community Based Outpatient Clinics or CBOCS are established within geographical catchment areas that have an established veteran patient population outside of the greater metropolitan areas that larger VA Medical Centers are normally located.  CBOCS allow veterans greater access to care and take away the burden of traveling to larger cities often hours from their homes.  COBOC often provide shorter waiting periods to receive care.  The Bridgeport, TX CBOC is currently owned and operated by C R Associates, Inc. This one month contract is awarded on the basis of Unusual and Compelling Urgency, FAR 6.302-2.  The amount of the contract is an estimated $103,000.00.  The contract is a firm fixed price contract. A request for quote/request for proposal will not be made available as this is a direct sole source award to C R Associates, Inc. Direct Patient care cannot be interrupted at any time.  This award allows for non-interruption in the healthcare of veteran beneficiaries living within the Bridgeport, TX catchment area.
