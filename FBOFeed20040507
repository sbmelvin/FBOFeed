<DESC>NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) plans to issue a Progressive Competition Draft Request For Proposal (DRFP)5-03253-GCC for industry comment.  NASA GSFC, in support to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration requires a contractor to perform the formulation and implementation activities for the Hyperspectral Environmental Suite (HES) for the upcoming Geosynchronous Operation Environmental Satellite (GOES) R series.  The HES is being developed to provide infrared and visible data collection capabilities for the GOES program series of geo-synchronous satellites to replace the current GOES Series Sounding instrumentation.  HES will provide improved atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles for weather forecasting. The first instrument is expected to fly on GOES-R in 2012 and will be capable of performing multiple tasks in support of environmental sciences.   During this first phase, "Formulation," the Contractor will complete Systems Requirements Analysis, System Trade Studies, Systems Requirements Baseline and Conceptual Design of a HES instrument.  At a minimum, the HES shall be capable of Disk Sounding for temperature and moisture, severe weather/mesoscale sounding for temperature and moisture and shelf and coastal waters images.  The following Trade Studies will be required during the formulation phase:	1) Spectral Detection Instrumentation Methods vs. Wavelength Trade Study; 2) Back-up Imaging Mode Trade Study; 3) Pixel Size Trade Study; 4) Coverage Rate Trade Study; 5) Calibration Methodologies Trade Study; 6) Rapid Local Area Image Update Study; 7) Data Rate Trade Study; 8) Detector Thermodynamic Trade Study; 9) Degraded Instrument Performance Trade Study; 10) Instrument Mechanical and Electrical Properties Trade Study; and any additional trade studies as proposed by the contractor(s).  The Contractor is also expected to perform risk assessments and prepare management plans as well as concept design and cost estimates.  Technical documents have been made available by GSFC at the GOES-R Series Industry Information website	 http://goes2.gsfc.nasa.gov/goesr_industry.htm	 This effort will be a full and open competition and will be acquired in two distinct phases: Phase 1 - Formulation; and Phase 2 - Implementation.  The applicable NAICS is 541330 "Engineering Services." Two or more Phase 1 - Formulation awards are anticipated leading to a single Phase 2 - Implementation award.  A progressive competition strategy will be used with down-selection of sources between phases. The competition for Phase 2 - Implementation will build on the results of Phase 1 - Formulation will include successful completion of Phase 1 requirements.  Accordingly, NASA anticipates that only Phase 1 - Formulation contractors will be capable of successfully competing for Phase 2. NASA will synopsize the second phase competition in accordance with FAR 5.201 and 5.203, but does not plan to issue a new, formal solicitation.  Instead, proposals will be requested from the initial phase contractors by a letter that will include detailed proposal preparation instructions and evaluation criteria.  Although a new, formal solicitation will not be issued, any responsible source may submit a proposal for Phase 2, and these proposals will be considered by the agency.  Other than the initial phase contractors, all material furnished in Phase 1 will be furnished to prospective offerors for Phase 2. To be considered for Phase 2 award, offerors must demonstrate a design maturity equivalent to that of the initial phase contractors, such demonstration to include any initial phase deliverables upon which the second phase award may be based.  Failure to fully and completely demonstrate the appropriate level of design maturity may render the proposal unacceptable with no further consideration for contract award. This DRFP is for information and planning purposes.  No proposal is requested, and no contract will be awarded as a result of this DRFP.  Potential Offerors are invited to comment on all aspects of the solicitation, including the requirements, proposal instructions, and evaluation approach.  If your comments include recommendations for revisions, you must provide your rationale for such revisions.	NASA anticipates issuance of the DRFP during the month of August 2003 with industry comments due approximately 14 days from the date the DRFP is first made available.  Monitor the NASA/GSFC Business Opportunities page Internet site for the release of the DRFP and subsequent RFP.  NASA anticipates issuance of the final RFP approximately 30 days after DRFP comments are received with proposals due 30 days later.   An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will be in Microsoft Office 97 format and will reside on a World-Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/GSFC Business Opportunities page is	 http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=51	 Prospective offerors are requested to notify this office of their intent to submit an offer.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the draft and final solicitation and amendments (if any). Any referenced numbered notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below. All contractual and technical questions must be submitted in writing (e-mail or FAX).  Telephone questions will not be accepted.

<DESC>The General Services Administration announces an opportunity for Construction Excellence in Public Buildings. The following document describes the Construction Manager As Constructor (CMc) Services Contract for the renovation of the Warren E. Burger Federal Building & U.S. Courthouse, 316 Robert Street, in St. Paul, Minnesota. The scope of CMc services under this proposed contract includes Pre-construction Phase Services and the option for Construction Phase Services. The CMc will be competitively chosen using Advisory Multi-step (FAR 15.202), and Source Selection (FAR 15.3) procedures. For this contract, technical factors, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price (see FAR 15.101-1 trade offs). Project Summary: The W.E. Burger Federal Building & U.S. Courthouse was constructed in 1966.  The seven- story building provides 260,541 occupiable square feet.  The renovation project will increase the presence and meet the operating needs of the courts, upgrade the facility to U.S. Courts Design Guide standards, meet ADA requirements and improve security. Work items include creating a separate circulation system for the judges, prisoner, staff and public; security upgrades at the building entrance, new salleyport, new Special Proceedings Courtroom, and expansion of the court family functions.  Construction will be phased, as the building will be fully occupied, during the renovation.  It is anticipated that multiple bid packages may be developed.   Estimated optional construction phase cost range is $25,000,000 to $30,000,000. Definition of Construction Manager as Constructor: A Construction Manager as Constructor, or CMc, is defined as a firm engaged under direct contract to a building owner, in this case the General Services Administration (GSA), to provide design review, cost estimating, scheduling and general construction services. The CMc shall be a member of the project development team during the planning, design, and construction phases, along with GSA as owner/developer and GSA's selected A-E firm, Teng & Associates, Inc., Chicago, IL, as well as other GSA consultants. (NOTE: No A-E contract has been negotiated or awarded at this time.) Proposal Submission Requirements: Proposals will be evaluated using a two-stage, advisory multi-step process (FAR 15.202). Stage I of the RFP will contain an explanation of the entire selection process, including the evaluation factors for Stage I and Stage II of the Request for Proposals (RFP). Under Stage I, offerors must submit information regarding the firm's qualifications, past performance, past experience, proposed personnel, experience with electronic project management (e-PM) and factors identified in the RFP. Submissions shall clearly address the rating factors identified in the Stage I RFP. The Government will evaluate Stage I of the RFP submissions to identify and advise the offerors about their potential to be viable competitors. The Government shall evaluate all responses in accordance with the criteria stated in Stage I of the RFP.  The Government shall advise each respondent in writing either that it will be invited to participate in the resultant acquisition or, based on the information submitted, that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor. The Government shall advise respondents considered not to be viable competitors of the general basis for that opinion. The Government shall inform all respondents that, notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their Stage I submissions, they may participate in Stage II of the acquisition. Offerors must submit a Detailed Project Management Plan, Oral Presentation, Price Proposals and Subcontracting Plans under Stage II of the RFP. All Stage II respondents shall provide a brief written narrative of their outreach efforts to utilize small disadvantaged and small women-owned businesses on this project. Large businesses shall be required to demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the following minimum goals for all subcontracted work: 40% for Small Business (SB) which includes 2.5% for HUBZone Small Business (HZSB), 8% for Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), 5% for Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB), and 5% for Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB) that includes 3% for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) for Fiscal Year 2003.

CONTRACTORS SHOULD FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS  BELOW. THE U.S. COAST GUARD AIRCRAFT REPAIR AND SUPPLY CENTER (ARSC) INTENDS TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES  FOR  REPAIR  OF:  (1 ) EACH VERTICAL STABILIZER ,  PN# MY20310G01 NSN: 1560-14-477-2082 . THE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER (OEM) IS DASSAULT AVIATION , CAGE CODE F6117 . REPAIRS ARE REQUIRED TO BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH OEM SPECIFICATION, STATEMENT OF WORK, 
U.S. COAST GUARD
HU25 VERTICAL STABALIZER
STATEMENT OF WORK
27 APRIL 04

1.0	BACKGROUND 
The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty (20) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  These aircraft are used differently from general aviation as HU-25 missions frequently operate within salt-laden environments.  This condition accelerates the corrosive attack to the HU-25’s vertical stabilizer  (P/N  MY20310G01).
2.0	OBJECTIVE
2.1.1.	The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized 
repair center to effectively repair and provide a complete, ready-to-install HU-25 vertical stabilizer assembly.  The repaired vertical stabilizer must meet the OEM’s critical profile and dimensions to ensure the fit to aircraft with minimal adjustment during installation.  In addition, corrosion preventative steps shall be incorporated during repair.
2.1.2.	The Coast Guard anticipates two levels of vertical stabilizer repair.  First, a “baseline repair” would be required for a stabilizer that is subject to limited damage, such as exterior corrosion or impact damage and replacement of hardware and/or skin.  Second, “extensive repair” would be required for a stabilizer that is beyond the scope of a baseline repair and would include the replacement of major extrusions, i.e., fittings.  The quoter shall provide a cost break down for items above and beyond a baseline repair.  At a minimum, these two levels of service should be addressed in the quote.  Quoters may submit additional levels of service.
3.0	To meet the Coast Guard’s objectives the quoter will be required to meet the following technical criteria: 
3.1.	The quoter is responsible for all necessary functions to perform services requested.  This includes, but is not limited, original Manufacturer’s drawings and specifications, required tooling, test equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, maintenance,  preservation, storage, shipping, etc., to repair/overhaul vertical stabilizers.
3.2.	Either possess or show ability to obtain adequate technical data, tooling and fixtures to meet the OEM’s critical profile and dimensions.
3.3.	Past Performance.
3.3.1.	Provide documentation for having performed repair/overhaul of similar or like items.
3.3.2.	Provide Points of Contact for past performance documentation for the past two years. Include references’ name, company, phone number, and e-mail address
3.3.3.	Provide evidence of and ability to maintain a Quality System acceptable to the Coast Guard.
3.0	APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS 
The following Technical Specifications are applicable:
a.	OEM :
1.	MY20331-15 drawings
2.	Falcon 20 Maintenance Manual , PUB: 067P, Chapters 51 and 55

b.	CG Technical Orders Vertical Stabilizer:

2.	CGTO 1U-25A-4, Chapters 55 (Illustrated Parts Catalog)
e.	Data Availability:

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technolgy (NIST), Acquisition and Logistics Division intends to negotiate on behalf of the Semiconductor Electronics Division with Carl Zeiss, Inc. of Thornwood, NY, for the upgrade of an existing Zeiss Pascal Confocal Fluorescence Imaging Microscope System,  purchased in 2002 from Zeiss.  

Under the authority of 41 USC 253 (c)(1), Only one responsible source, Carl Zeiss Inc. is the only manufacturer capable of successful completion of this equipment upgrade. 

Sole source determination is based on the following:  (1) Under the original award, Zeiss offered the opportunity for NIST to upgrade the instrument from a model Pascal system to a model LSM 510 Pascal System and credit the returned parts towards the cost of the upgrade if the upgrade would take place within 2 years of the original purchase.  The major parts that will be upgraded are the scanning head and the controller electronics for the scanning head; (2) The scanning modules and scanning heads of the model Pascal and model LSM 510 are proprietary designs to Zeiss; (3) Zeiss is the only manufacturer that provides simultaneous multi-color detection and Meta detection for spectral response measurements.  In our present application, NIST requires the ability to measure multi-color emission (different wavelengths) simultaneously.

<DESC>Description - *****REVISION*****

The Government Printing Office (GPO), in coordination with Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs (CA), intends to release a Request for Proposal for the development/deployment of a new Electronic Passport that contains an embedded Integrated Circuit (IC). This initiative includes the integration and procurement of contactless integrated circuit technology into the traditional paper-based passport booklet document.  One of the primary driving forces that has led to this requirement is Section 303(c) of the Enhanced Border Security Act and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 which requires, inter alia, that countries that participate in the US Visa Waiver Program have a program to issue to their nationals machine readable passports that are tamper resistant and incorporate biometric and document authentication identifiers that comply with applicable biometric and document identifying standards established by the International Civil Aviation Organization. Consistent with principles of international reciprocity, the United States intends to adhere to these same requirements. The use of contactless integrated circuit technology arises as a direct result of standards decisions taken by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which announced in May 2003 that ICAO has selected high capacity, contactless integrated circuit (IC) chips to store identification information in MRTDs -- passports, visas and identity cards. This decision and the related determinations made by ICAO regarding the use of biometrics for travel document applications are reflected in Document 9303, Part 1, the ICAO standards for passports, and supporting ICAO Technical Reports. The Request for Proposal relates to the requirement for a chip inlay assembly and for the integration of that inlay into the U.S. passport. The U.S. intends to integrate chip technology into passports in several phases of implementation. The first, and most urgent need, is to begin issuance of biometric-carrying electronic passports at a single domestic passport issuance facility in late 2004, and then to transition to issuance of electronic passports at all remaining domestic issuance facilities by the end of 2005. In parallel, CA will work with the Department of Homeland Security to conduct field testing of the newly issued passports. The remaining phases of implementation will be carried out more broadly in terms of both issuance as well as inspection, with the ultimate goal of issuing all full validity, domestically issued US passports in the new electronic format. Product Specifications: In accordance with ICAO specifications and State Department requirements, the product sought shall be ISO/IEC 14443, Part 1-4 compliant, Type A or B, with a minimum storage capacity of 64 K (kilobytes) chip/antenna assembly embedded in an inlay suitable for incorporation into the paper passport book; on-board operating system in accordance with ISO/IEC Standard 7816-4; the data will be stored on the chip in the Logical Data Structure prescribed by ICAO and secured with a digital signature. The ICAO has developed supplementary interoperability specifications covering a number of factors such as power levels, performance timings, read rate, buffer size and others.  Most US passports are issued for a ten-year period of validity; thus, the passport and its embedded chip assembly must meet this requirement in terms of overall durability in normal use. Testing of offered inlays and passports with embedded inlays will be conducted.  Tests will include: durability, flexing, susceptibility to solvents, electrical/magnetic fields, stamping, and the routine use to which an international traveler is likely to subject the passport.   Additional information will be included in the RFP. The chip will store data regarding the authorized bearer of the passport. Specifically, the chip will store the same printed, personalization information visible in the passport’s visual and machine readable zones such as name, issuance authority, date and place of birth etc.. Additionally, to meet the ICAO requirement for a globally interoperable biometric, the chip will store at least one 12 K compressed full facial image of the authorized document bearer. Authenticity of data and protection of privacy are critical considerations. Similarly, facilitation of travel is a corollary objective along with enhanced border security. Therefore, the performance variables associated with transmission speeds and data transfer rates should be addressed clearly and comprehensively. The Electronic Passport must be electronically readable on a globally interoperable basis. Vendors should consider that incorporation of the IC into the document should be accomplished with as little impact on current book manufacturing and passport issuance operations as possible. There are three areas of operational consideration that together constitute the overall concept of operations for the U. S. passport production.  First, GPO will continue to manufacture the US passport at its location in Washington, DC.  It is intended that the chip assembly/inlay, will be provided to GPO for fabrication into the US passport.    The offered inlay solutions should provide as little impact as possible on existing GPO book production processes.   The susceptibility of the assembly/inlay to temperature variables, flexing, bending, etc. are important features that will be addressed in testing by NIST.  Second, the Department of State will continue to personalize passports using its Toppan MP300US printers. The use of the chip and the incorporation of the inlay in the book must be compatible with this process to the extent possible and without any impact on the ability to print data into the passport. Finally, the inspection of documents, generally carried out at international ports of entry, is the third systemic area of concern. Inspection of U.S. passports will vary all over the world and passports will be subject to manual, machine-reading, and possibly unattended examination. Electronic Passport readers will vary in many ways, although ICAO has recommended that ISO Standard 14443 both A and B capable be used. Pricing information will be required for both small quantities required in early stages of implementation as well as larger quantities that will be required for full nationwide implementation. The US currently issues approximately 8 million passports annually.  It is the intent of CA that all will be issued as electronic passports by the end of calendar year 2005. Policy options under consideration related to the US passport could possibly increase annual passport issuance to the range of 12 million or higher. Potential bidders will be requested to include a schedule for delivery, milestones related thereto, dependencies or caveats in such scheduling, and manufacturing capacity/flexibility with regard to both small quantities early in implementation and higher quantities as volume reaches maximum. Bidders will also be asked to disclose any information regarding health and safety concerns with respect to the use their proposals (i.e. the use of any adhesives that may be necessary to secure the offered inlays to the passport book).  It is anticipated that a walk-through of the Government Printing Office and a typical passport agency will be conducted. A maximum of two representatives from each prospective prime may attend these walk-throughs. Confirmation dates, times, and locations will be specified in the final solicitation. A draft RFP will be released on/or about 5/17/04.   Issuance of a solicitation can be expected on/or about 5/31/04, with a response due on or about 7/01/04.  Contract award(s) will be made on or about 8/13/04. Offerors will be evaluated on technical merit, past performance, and price.  Multiple awards may be considered. This will be a firm-fixed contract for materials with T&M rates for labor. Award is planned for one-year with four 1-year options. This procurement action will be unrestricted but only those companies with proven inlay design and fabrication experience will be considered. Buy American Act provisions apply to this procurement.  All prospective offerors should submit their questions to Albertha Broadnax by eamil at Contract Specialist; abroadnax@gpo.gov; or Herbert Jackson, Contracting Officer; hjackson@gpo.gov or by facsimile at 202-512-1354.  This synopsis does not constitute an RFP and does not obligate the Government in any way.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Sole Source.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), New Orleans, LA, intends to negotiate a firm-fixed price contract on a sole source basis with the University of New Orleans for a four to six month period commencing with June 2004.  This contra ct will be for the use of the large computing power available on the parallel processors of a Beowulf cluster to run the ADvanced  CIRCulation (ADCIRC) hydraulic model.   The model is used to simulate various hurricane intensities and paths to determine th e required levee heights for hurricane projection projects in the New Orleans District.  ADCIRC is a system of computer programs for solving time dependent, free surface circulation and transport problems in two and three dimensions.  These programs utiliz e the finite element method in space and therefore can be run on high flexible, irregularly spaced grids.  The grid that will be used is very large.  Presently, it is comprised of 314,000 plus nodes and will be expanded to approximately 500,000 nodes.  Thi s large grid requires a computer with multiple processors running in parallel.  The computer simulation of a particular hurricane track also produces extremely large output files.  The objective is to use a local (New Orleans) computer and to physically (v ia automobile) transfer the output data files to the designers (USACE) to increase the number of model simulations that can be performed during a work period .   The USACE is anticipating 60,000 node hours of use.  Award of this requirement will be in acco rdance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 12.   Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.   If you believe your firm possesses the ability to provide all the above services, then you must res pond by 19 May 2004, 1:00 PM Central Time.  E-mail your response demonstrating your capability of providing this requirement to Kim.M.Theophile@MVN02.usace.army.mil

CONTRACTORS SHOULD FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS  BELOW. THE U.S. COAST GUARD AIRCRAFT REPAIR AND SUPPLY CENTER (ARSC) INTENDS TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES  FOR  REPAIR  OF:  (1 ) EACH VERTICAL STABILIZER ,  PN# MY20310G01 NSN: 1560-14-477-2082 . THE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER (OEM) IS DASSAULT AVIATION , CAGE CODE F6117 . REPAIRS ARE REQUIRED TO BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH OEM SPECIFICATION, STATEMENT OF WORK, 
U.S. COAST GUARD
HU25 VERTICAL STABALIZER
STATEMENT OF WORK
27 APRIL 04

1.0	BACKGROUND 
The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty (20) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  These aircraft are used differently from general aviation as HU-25 missions frequently operate within salt-laden environments.  This condition accelerates the corrosive attack to the HU-25’s vertical stabilizer  (P/N  MY20310G01).
2.0	OBJECTIVE
2.1.1.	The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized 
repair center to effectively repair and provide a complete, ready-to-install HU-25 vertical stabilizer assembly.  The repaired vertical stabilizer must meet the OEM’s critical profile and dimensions to ensure the fit to aircraft with minimal adjustment during installation.  In addition, corrosion preventative steps shall be incorporated during repair.
2.1.2.	The Coast Guard anticipates two levels of vertical stabilizer repair.  First, a “baseline repair” would be required for a stabilizer that is subject to limited damage, such as exterior corrosion or impact damage and replacement of hardware and/or skin.  Second, “extensive repair” would be required for a stabilizer that is beyond the scope of a baseline repair and would include the replacement of major extrusions, i.e., fittings.  The quoter shall provide a cost break down for items above and beyond a baseline repair.  At a minimum, these two levels of service should be addressed in the quote.  Quoters may submit additional levels of service.
3.0	To meet the Coast Guard’s objectives the quoter will be required to meet the following technical criteria: 
3.1.	The quoter is responsible for all necessary functions to perform services requested.  This includes, but is not limited, original Manufacturer’s drawings and specifications, required tooling, test equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, maintenance,  preservation, storage, shipping, etc., to repair/overhaul vertical stabilizers.
3.2.	Either possess or show ability to obtain adequate technical data, tooling and fixtures to meet the OEM’s critical profile and dimensions.
3.3.	Past Performance.
3.3.1.	Provide documentation for having performed repair/overhaul of similar or like items.
3.3.2.	Provide Points of Contact for past performance documentation for the past two years. Include references’ name, company, phone number, and e-mail address
3.3.3.	Provide evidence of and ability to maintain a Quality System acceptable to the Coast Guard.
3.0	APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS 
The following Technical Specifications are applicable:
a.	OEM :

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) in full and open competition to implement the program described below.  USAID has a long history of promoting justice sector improvements in Honduras since 1985.  For the 1997-2003 strategy period, USAID Honduras initiated the Strengthened Rule of Law and Respect for Human Rights (SROL I) activity.  The SROL I activity was designed to promote democracy in Honduras through support to key justice sector institutions and civil society. The objectives of the SROL I activity were: 1) a new Criminal Procedures Code (CPC) effectively implemented; 2) an independent, apolitical and effective judiciary established; 3) an independent, apolitical and effective Public Ministry established; 4) broader civil society participation in justice sector reforms and monitoring; and 5) a changed mind set in the courts, in universities and elsewhere regarding the rule of law.  The activities under the SROL I activity are now being completed and will end in September 2004.
 
Significant change has occurred in the criminal justice system with the implementation of the new CPC, which introduced oral adversarial trials, more effective and transparent procedures, and greater protections for individual rights.  Nevertheless, the Government of Honduras (GOH) recognizes that numerous obstacles impede the effective functioning of the country’s legal system.  The judiciary in a democratic society must be independent of the Legislative and the Executive branches and therefore, not susceptible to improper political and economic influences from within the government and from private sector interests.  Changes in the institutional leadership that are subject to political interests threaten the reforms achieved to date and undermine the independence of key democratic institutions.  To improve the public’s confidence in its democratic systems and equal protection under the law, the Honduras justice system must strengthen its independence and protect itself from the influence of special interests that challenge the application of the rule of law.  Honduras has taken many important steps in reforming its justice sector, but further progress is required to address the rights of citizens to receive a fair hearing in court through a legal system that respects its own laws and regulations.
 
The current USAID Honduras strategy is entitled “Honduras Country Plan in Support of the Central America and Mexico (CAM) Regional Strategy.”  The Country Plan was approved in August 2003 and sets forth the strategy of the USAID Honduras Mission for the period 2003-2008.  Under the new strategy, USAID/Honduras will build on the successes of the SROL I activity, particularly with regard to promoting inter-institutional approaches and developing a cadre of leadership for reform.  The new, 2-1/2 year SROL II activity will strengthen the momentum for reform within the institutions by improving the capacity of legal personnel, supporting the active engagement of professional associations to sustain justice reform, and focusing on the successful implementation of essential parts of the CPC and critical judicial independence issues.  The SROL II activity intends to increase respect for the rule of law, as well as its sustainability, by helping to deepen and diversify the constituencies that support ongoing reform.  The new activity will also introduce alternative dispute resolution as a means for increasing access to justice for marginalized groups as well as to provide another avenue to dispute resolution for commercial claimants.  Work will also support reform of the Civil Procedure Code, to introduce oral and more transparent and streamlined trial proceedings.  
 
The contractor will work closely with other donors involved in justice sector activities as well as with other USAID Honduras Strategic Objective Teams, particularly the Economic Growth Strategic Objective (SO 2) in implementing activities supporting commercial claimants and civil court reforms.  One performance-based cost-reimbursement contract will be awarded for implementation of these activities.  Implementation will occur over a 2-1/2 year period.  We anticipate issuing the RFP o/a March 24, 2004.

<DESC>NASA/KSC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for pursing the procurement and implementation of a commercial off the shelf (COTS) Electronic Health Record System (EHRS) to replace its current paper-based medical records.  The vendor must provide an operationally functional application with a demonstrated capability to meet the medical, administrative, and regulatory requirements of an Occupational Health (OH) clinic through proven work flow processes.   The minimum functional requirements for the application include but are not limited to management of injury and illness, management of medical surveillance and certification programs, management of multiple provider schedules, and seamless interface with medical equipment and external clinical laboratories. The application must be managed from one central location and use the Internet securely as the vehicle for inter-communication at fourteen (14) individual site clinics requiring access to all health records.  Internet performance must not be the limiting factor for application processing speed or security.  The application must collect all information in one central location for the purpose of redundant information backup and sub-population level query.	The key objectives of the EHRS include the following: 1.	Standardization of healthcare delivery across all NASA clinics 2.	Improved effectiveness of identifying and managing occupational health issues in the workplace 3.	Compliance with Federal regulations and OH standards 4.	Metrics-based management of OH elements 5.	A market valuation of services provided The application’s process design, data modeling, and system validation will be performed once with implementation at each site clinic performed on a rolling schedule. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.

Because the Government has not purchased data rights for this system, we anticipate that the Government will solicit and negotiate any contract that may be awarded in connection with this request to only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302(1).  Proprietary data rights for the system are owned by Coastal Environmental Systems with software provided by Mesotech International Inc.  Nevertheless, we are seeking information on other parties that may have the interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This SSS is for market research purposes only and respondents are reminded that a formal solicitation may not necessarily result. Information received as a result of this market survey may be reflected in a formal solicitation. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this request, nor will the Government compensate respondents for any costs incurred in developing information provided to OO-ALC-LHW. Recommend that information be limited to that readily available and that “proprietary” information not be included. However without written permission from the respondent, OO-ALC-LHW will not release to any firm, agency or individual outside the Government any information marked “proprietary”. The response packages are due to Jill Larsen OO-ALC-LHKC address: 6029 Wardleigh Road, Bldg 1207 Hill AFB UT 84056-5838 within 14 calendar days of the date this notice appears in the FBO.
The Air Force plans to transition from Interim Contractor Support (ICS) to Contractor Logistic Support (CLS) for the AN/FMQ-19 Automatic Meteorological Station (AMS).

<DESC>This preliminary information is being made available for planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled "Solicitation for Information or Planning Purposes." It does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation, and it is not be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract. This procurement is subject to review or cancellation at any time.  SDO is the first mission under the Living With a Star (LWS) program as part of the Sun-Earth Connection. SDO will be made up of several instruments seeking to characterize the dynamic state of the Sun, thus enhancing NASA's understanding of the solar process and space weather. SDO is viewed as a follow-on to the successful Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission. It will be a three-axis stabilized satellite in a circular geosynchronous orbit of ~105 degrees longitude and having an inclination of 28.5 degrees. SDO will have a mission life of 5 years.  NASA/GSFC is soliciting comments on requirements established regarding the Waveguide Rotary Joint Assemblies for the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) project. The present requirements are specified in the attached documents:  Exhibit 1 – Statement of Work - Waveguide Rotary Joint Assemblies 464-MECSM-LEGL-0028 Exhibit 2 – Performance Specification - Waveguide Rotary Joint Assemblies 464- MECSM-SPEC-0036 This notice is issued by the NASA/GSFC to post a draft Statement of Work and Specification via the internet, and solicit input and recommendations from interested parties. The objective of this RFI is to gather information that promotes competition and increases procurement efficiency by improving NASA/GSFC's knowledge of industry's capabilities. NASA/GSFC invites potential offerors to submit information that may be used to determine eligibility to be participants in feedback sessions with the SDO project. This procedure is described in FAR Part 15.202. The intent of the sessions is to provide a dialogue in which participants can provide feedback on NASA/GSFC's requirements and its acquisition approach. The compilation of submitted information may be factored along with SDO requirements to refine the aforementioned SOW (Exhibit 1) and Performance Specification (Exhibit 2).  Potential offerors are requested to submit information in the form of a brief Capabilities and Qualifications Statement that includes 1. Capability to comply with the present requirements outlined in the Performance Specification and SOW. Requirements that are not in compliance should be noted with brief comments that either describe how a potential offeror's actuator could be brought into compliance or state the potential offeror's position on such a requirement. This would serve as a main topic in one-on-one feedback sessions. It should also be stated as to whether certain requirements are cost drivers or increase risk and as to whether or not a fixed-price contract would be acceptable, 2. Capability to meet the hardware deliverable schedule, and 3. Summary of past relevant experience in developing propellant tanks.  This notice constitutes all information concerning the SDO Waveguide Rotary Joint Assemblies requirement that will be furnished at this time. Interested firms are requested to submit their capability statements to Mr. Carlos R. McKenzie, NASA/GSFC, Mail Code 464, Greenbelt, MD 20771, e-mail: Carlos.R.McKenzie@nasa.gov no later than the response date indicated above.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis. Responses to this publication are solicited to identify qualified sources. This is not a request for a formal proposal.  The anticipated NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541990 with a size standard of $6M.
	
This synopsis seeks to identify contractors that can provide access to Pediatric Inpatient Drug Utilization Data.  A one-year base contract with two, 1-year options is contemplated.  The major objectives to be accomplished under this contract are to provide FDA with: 1) Immediate automated access to a currently existing, pediatric inpatient data resource with the capability of providing counts of discharges and/or patients utilizing drugs in children’s hospitals, and characterizing the hospitalization episode; 2) Direct, unlimited access to data in a multi-user environment and in real time; and 3) The ability to download (or obtain by other means) large datasets as needed, for the purpose of conducting epidemiological drug safety studies.  The data resource shall contain information from a minimum of 25 pediatric hospitals, and must be commercially available as of July 1, 2004.  FDA is not interested in developing this database and expects any qualified organization to provide the data as well as the means to access the data.  For purposes of this synopsis a pediatric hospital is defined as an institution which is organized and operated for the care of individuals who are usually less than 18 years of age, and who are being treated for conditions that normally require a stay of 30 days or less.  The data provided shall meet the need of the FDA to access discharge-level and/or patient-level data describing pediatric inpatient drug use in children’s hospitals.  The size and characteristics of the population of hospitals from which the data are derived shall be provided to the FDA.  Characterizing of the sample shall minimally include: number of hospitals, size of hospitals, geographic diversity of hospitals, number of discharges per year, demographic distribution of discharges in the sample, types of hospitals and a description of specialty units within sample hospitals. Also, if available, the FDA would like to know the number of unique patients hospitalized per year in the sample and their demographic distribution. The FDA has no interest in knowing the identity of any patient, provider, or hospital included in the data resource.  It shall be solely the Contractor’s responsibility to de-identify the data for FDA use.  In addition, the following information shall be provided: 1) the number of years of valid data available overall and in real time; 2) the ability and ease of accessing data that is no longer on-line; 3) the lag time between the date of service for the hospitalization and on-line availability of the data; and 4) data collection and management procedures.  These characteristics are essential for determining whether the data meet the needs of the FDA for making timely regulatory decisions based on the most current, scientifically valid information available.  The inpatient data shall be amenable to analysis at the discharge-level and/or patient-level.  Age and gender of the patient at hospitalization shall be required.   Hospitalization episode data shall be required, and shall include the dates of hospitalization, the length of stay, all diagnoses related to the hospitalization, all procedures, and discharge disposition. Data related to drug prescriptions in hospital shall be required for all drugs administered during the hospitalization episode, and shall include the generic and established name for the drug, strength, and dosage form.  A complete data dictionary shall also be included.
Also, if available, the FDA would like to know information on race/ethnicity of hospitalized patients, accompanied by documentation of the origin of this information.  The FDA would additionally like the following information relating to the hospitalization episode, if available: operating room and radiology procedure and drug data (anesthetics, contrast agents, etc.), microbiology data (cultures, sensitivities, antigen testing, etc.), information on admitting diagnosis, drugs at admission, and drugs at discharge.  The FDA would like the following drug-related information, if available, for all administered drugs: date administered, treatment dose, and treatment duration.

As part of the evaluation process offerors shall provide a seven-day trail subscription and technical documentation for four individuals, at no cost to the FDA, to the full, commercially available version of the database for the purpose of evaluation.  During the trial subscription period, the FDA shall only use the data for the purpose of evaluation of the data resource.  FDA shall not use the data, nor any analyses derived from the data, for public disclosure or regulatory decision-making.

Interested parties shall submit a capability statement not to exceed 10 pages, in Microsoft Word, no later than March 26, 2004 to the Contract Specialist via email at kminker@oc.fda.gov

Note: Responses must reference Request for Information (RFI) number D84002.

Request for copies of the RFP or other documents relating to this requirement will not be addressed.   No questions will be answered concerning this requirement until AFTER the RFP has been released.  Any questions received (via any medium including E-mail, Mail, Phone or Fax) before the RFP is released will be deleted/not addressed.   There is no additional information available at this time about this requirement.

<SUBJECT>A--High-Efficiency, Small Form Factor, Solid State Power Amplifier for HC3 Amendment to BAA DAAB07-03-R-P650, Topic S0401
<SOLNBR>W15P7T-04-R-K699
<RESPDATE>052804
<ARCHDATE>07272004
<CONTACT>Charles Ade, (732) 427-1334
<DESC>1.1 PURPOSE: The purpose of this one time amendment is to augment BAA Topic #S0401, Antenna Research for Satellite Communications On-The-Move.  POCs for this action are: Mr. John Nilsen, (732) 532-9210 ext 5624, john.nilsenjr@us.army.mil; Mr. Peter S tevens, (732) 427-2039, peter.stevens@us.army.mil.  This notice augments/updates the existing BAA topic with the following information: The Space & Terrestrial Communications Directorate (S&TCD) [in conjunction with PM WIN-T for the High Capacity Communications Capability (HC3) program] is interested in receiving proposals for the development and demonstration of a high-power, high-efficie ncy, solid-state power amplifier (SSPA) for use with Q-band (44GHz) Extremely High Frequency (EHF) standard up-converters.  The primary focus of this effort is the development and demonstration of an SSPA with a goal of greater than 10W at 44GHz and a form -factor of less than 25 in3.   This effort specifically solicits novel designs capable of being scaled to higher power outputs with minimal decrease in efficiency and increase in overall size and weight.  A small form factor, high efficiency, high power, l ow cost SSPA is essential to fielding a reliable, affordable, full-duplex, on-the-move SATCOM system in support of the Army's Objective Force. 1.2 ARMY NEED:  The Army is pursuing an innovative technology to meet transformation goals of a lighter, faster, more lethal force with integrated on-the-move communications from sensor to shooter.  Novel, high-power SSPAs will enable the Army to achieve h igh data rate transmission for Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Beyond-Line-of-Sight (BLOS) on-the-move (OTM) communications.  The Army Objective Force and Transformational Communications (TC) Architecture require small, low profile, affordable, mobile, satellite c ommunication (SATCOM) terminals. Similarly, these small terminals require small, lightweight, efficient high power amplifiers to achieve high quality of service (QOS) and uplink reliability. Successful completion of this contract will result in significant  risk reduction for PM WIN-T's HC3 SATCOM OTM transmission capabilities.  Moreover, the SSPA's scalability to higher power (10 to 30+W) will ultimately enable the Army to achieve its high data rate transmission requirements and provide the Warfighter with faster two-way LOS and BLOS communications connectivity.  1.3 TECHNICAL CONCEPT:  This program seeks to develop an innovative and reliable solution for the difficult challenge of achieving greater than 10W at 44GHz in a very small package.  The specifications for the SSPA are driven by the need to place the devic e as close as possible to the antenna feed, to minimize losses and conserve available space.  The device must be a drop-in replacement for current transmit architectures, interfacing with standard +5 dBm 44GHz up-converters.  Consequently, the SSPA must pr ovide 35 dB of gain at the target frequency.  Due to the nature of EHF, the SSPA should be capable of rapidly turning on/off, on the order of 450 nsec, for DC power conservation.   Power added efficiency should exceed 15%.  Specific goals of this program include:  	Psat @ +5dBm input greater than 10W 	Maximizing Power Added Efficiency [PAE] (greater than 15%) 	Volume less than 25 in3 	Demonstrated scalability of design to higher power transmitters 	Examine trades between higher Psat and lower PAE 1.4 BENEFITS:  This effort will yield a greater than 10W solid-state power amplifier for plug-n-play integration with small aperture TC SATCOM terminals.  These SSPA-driven antenna systems will provide a new high data rate, on-the-move communications trans mission capability via satellite.  (This capability is specifically addressed in the WIN-T ORD and the FCS Block II requirements.)  The ability to transmit communications data on-the-move, at high rates, from small, low profile antennas greatly improves co nnectivity between organizational and operational elements and incr eases mission effectiveness and survivability.  SSPAs are key enablers of the High Capacity Communications Capability (HC3) and Transformational Communications (TC) terminal implementation plans. The On-the-Move SATCOM communication systems enabled by this  program represent a new and vital communication capability for the Future Combat Systems (FCS) Warfighter in the field.   2.1 SCHEDULE:  This effort will start ASAP by request of the WIN-T program manager.  The anticipated date of contract award is early July FY04.  This will be a 14-18 month effort, depending on the time required by the contractor to deliver the necessary ha rdware.  The contractorÃ¢Â€Â™s proposed contract shall neither exceed a total value of $1.0M (across two fiscal years, FY04-05) nor a period of 18 months.  The sample schedule is based on a desirable 14-month timeframe.  Proposals are due by 28 May 2004. The draft SSPA design/spec is required no later than six (6) months from the start of the program.  It shall include a thorough discussion of the design, known challenges and specific planned steps to overcome them.  The final SSPA design/spec is required no later than nine (9) months from the start of the program.  It shall include a detailed design for the 44GHz SSPA architecture, including relevant technical drawings, performance simulations, and calculated electrical and mechanical parameters.

<SUBJECT>Z--Modify and repair the control system for the Hoover Dam 150-Ton cableway.
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Boulder City Regional Office, Boulder City, Nevada, intends to award on a sole source basis a purchase order to Advanced Automation Associates, 640 Rice Blvd, Exton, PA  19341.   Advanced Automation Associates employee Barry Ziegenfuse is the original designer of the cableway control system.  This control system was designed by Mr. Ziegenfuse in the mid-1990s.  Mr. Ziegenfuse was also involved with start-up and troubleshooting the new controls in the mid-1990s.  Mr. Ziegenfuse has a very detailed and comprehensive knowledge of these cableway controls which he designed.  The cableway control system at Hoover Dam is unique to Hoover Dam and is not used for the control of any other cableway in the world. There would be substantial duplication of cost to the Government if another vendor were used and that cost is not expected to be recovered through competition.  There would be unacceptable delays in fulfilling requirements for an operational cableway at Hoover Dam if another vendor were used.  The 150-ton cableway at Hoover Dam provides the only means of moving large loads into the dam and powerhouse.  Road access to the dam and powerhouse is severely limited by the restricted width and height of the tunnel on the road between Highway 93 and the powerhouse.  Reliable operation of equipment at Hoover Dam requires the capability for cableway operation.   This procurement will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition procedures.  The anticipated award date is May 18, 2004.  Interested parties believing they are capable of performing the work, should submit a statement to the Contracting Officer outlining their qualifications to do the work.  Responses may be sent e-mail to bnelson@lc.usbr.gov or faxed to Beverly Nelson at (702) 293-8050.

<SUBJECT>R -- Notification of Intent to Sole Source
<DESC>General Services Administration (GSA), Southern Service Center (10PZ2), intends to issue a (*SOLE SOURCE*) contract for security services to Portland Downtown Services, Inc. (PDS).  This contract is being procured as a sole source acquisition under Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Section 6.302-1 and the Public Buildings Cooperative Use Act of 1976 (Good Neighbor Program).  PDS provides the security services under the Agreement for Downtown Clean and Safe District Management Services on public property under the control of the City of Portland.  GSA’s minimum requirement is to provide maximum assurance of a safe and healthy workplace for Federal employees.  Because PDS is under contract with the City of Portland to perform security services for property under the control of the city under uniform District-wide security standards, PDS has the unique capability to provide security services to GSA which are coordinated and integrated with the security services provided to other property owners in the District.  Due to the critical importance of coordination and control in implementing effective and responsive security measures, GSA’s needs most effectively can be satisfied (*ONLY*) by contracting with the Portland Downtown Services, Inc. for the required services.  For additional information contact the Contract Specialist, Amy Wong, at (503) 326-4078.

<SUBJECT>A -- Proposer's Day Announcement - Advanced Speech Encoding (ASE) Phase II
<DESC>PROPOSERS DAY CONFERENCE: A Proposers Day Conference for Phase 2 of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Advanced Speech Encoding (ASE) Program will be held on 7 June 2004 at the Executive Conference Center, Strategic Analysis, Inc., 3601 Wilson Blvd, Arlington, VA beginning at 8:30am with an anticipated ending time of 5:00pm. The objective of the DARPA ASE program is to achieve ultra-low bit rate voice encoding (300 bps) with acceptable intelligibility, quality, and speaker recognizability in acoustically harsh environments, and to package and demonstrate the technology in a prototype suitable for a field demonstration. Phase 2 will consist of two thrust areas.  The first will focus on the technology development necessary to achieve the ultra-low bit rate objective and prototype development.  DARPA anticipates the need to combine a multi-sensor approach, including noise-immune sensors that provide excitation information, with coding paradigms that can achieve ultra-low bit rates. The second thrust area will focus on characterizing the nature of subauditory (nonacoustic) speech and its potential utility as an alternative means of communication in acoustically challenging environments. 

The purpose of the conference is to provide program information, address questions from potential proposers, and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities. It is expected that teams of experts will be needed to achieve and demonstrate the ASE Program objective.  During the conference, time and facilities will be available to facilitate teaming discussions. Additionally, a portion of the conference will be reserved for presentations by prospective proposers who wish to present company overviews, discuss their technology expertise, or discuss teaming opportunities. Presentations may contain up to five (5) slides and will be limited to five (5) minutes followed by five (5) minutes of question/answer if needed. It is the presenter?s responsibility to ensure that all material that is presented is approved by the organization that funded the research. Proposers interested in making presentations should contact Mr. Mark Kaczmarek (mkaczmarek@schafertmd.com) by 1 June 2004 for scheduling. In addition, an electronic copy of the presentation slides must be provided to Mr. Kaczmarek by 1 June 2004 for prior review by DARPA. On 8 June 2004, conference rooms will be available at Schafer Corporation to facilitate additional teaming discussions. Contact Mr. Kaczmarek for scheduling.

Registration for the Proposers Day Conference is on-line at https://www.schafertmd.com/ase2004. If on-line registration is not possible, please contact Mr. Kaczmarek by e-mail no later than 1 June 2004 to register. Foreign nationals will be required to complete and return the DARPA Foreign National Visitor Request (DARPA Form 60) no later than 1 June 2004 if they wish to attend the conference. 

It is anticipated that a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the program will be released after the conference. Attendance at the Proposers Day Conference is not required to propose to any BAA that may be published in the future as related to this technology area.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

<DESC>This is amendment #3.  The respose time has been extended to 12:00 EST on April 21, 2004.  Please refer to attachment #1 which has been uploaded to FEDBIZOPS as a seperate JPEG file.
Question:
You have stated that the rear wheel wells need blast protection. Can you confirm that the front wheel wells also need blast protection? If you look at the attachment the Left and Right body tubs attach up on the back side of the front wheel wells plus the under carriage panel will protect against IEDs.  I am not concerned about protecting the engine compartment.
 
Question:
Can you clarify the driveline blast protection?   If you look again at the attachment, the under carriage compartment protects the whole under boby of the vehicle to include the drive line area.  Do you require a vehicle long skid pad to protect the driveshaft??   Again if you look at the attachment the under carrage panel covers the entire under carrage.  
 
Question:
Rear cabin close out: What is the exact meaning of this? If you look at the attachment (at the back of the HMMWV, there are two different types of troop cabin blindes. One is a solid blind (we do not want the solid blind).  We want the three section blind so you can remove the center section to maximize protection and still support the troops in the  back.  We understand it to be the rear panel of the passenger/troop cabin? Is our understanding correct?  YES.
    
Question:
Rear blinders: In the e-mail you stated that these are the side rails along the sides of the HMMWV? Could you be more specific, are they running vertically or horizontally to the ground? Are they just above the rear wheel?  Our HMMWVs have a C-pillar roll system with supporting side rails to complete the roll over protection.  Armor panels cover the side rails down to the top of the wheel wells (running vertical to the ground).
 
Question:
Tubs (right and left): Do these refer to the side panels that cover up the side opening for the rear seats? Or does it mean the actual rear seat compartment itself (where the troop’s feet go)? Looking at the attachment the Left & Right tubs:  From front to back it starts up on the rear side of the front wheel well (covering the driver/passenger lower dash and floorboard area), continues under the troop cabin, up onto the front side of the rear wheel wells (protecting the rear passengers back side).
From outside in:  Protests from the bottom of the doos and under the troop seating area (the under carrage panel covers the drive train area).

<DESC>This amendment is hereby issued to address technical questions. 

1) An oversized pump on a high vacuum system will not benefit the Government.  Leaks in the system will not be able to be detected, since the pump will easily keep up with any leaks in the vacuum system.  The system will appear to be leak tight because the vacuum gauge indicates the vacuum pressure is in the required range, but only because the over sized pump is keeping up with the leaks.
2) The over size pump will require an over sized backing pump to keep up with the oversized turbo pump (4X).  This is a rather large additional expenditure.
3) A larger adapter is also an unnecessary additional expenditure.
4) Space is very limited in this particular application, so additional modifications to the vacuum system would be required to accommodate the larger capacity pump.

6. PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

The Companhia de Saneamento Basico do Estado de São Paulo (“SABESP”) is the utility in charge of the planning, implementation and operation of potable water and basic sanitation facilities in 366 municipalities in the State of Sao Paulo.  SABESP provides service to 25 million people.  Its operations vary in size ranging from the Sao Paulo metropolitan area with 18 million inhabitants to medium and large cities ranging from 100,000 to 1 million inhabitants to small towns with less than 100,000 inhabitants.  

SABESP has identified several areas in which it requires technical assistance.

1)	Effective potable water treatment systems.  SABESP is seeking to establish a more effective water treatment process.  Population growth has placed a number of stresses on the the Upper Tiete River, which is the source of water for 2.5 million people in the greater São Paulo area, and the Lower Cotia River, which supplies another 300,000.  SABESP is trying to develop new treatment processes for these sources of potable water. 
2)	Distribution Management:  SABESP is seeking TA to improve the performance of water distribution operations.  In the São Paulo metropolitan area there are 25,000 km of distribution mains and 20,000 km of service connections.  SABESP conducts approximately 20,000 repairs per month to its water distribution network.  To improve the quality of its services, SABESP is seeking state-of-the-art tools to improve the operational management of its distribution network, its maintenance system, and existing control mechanisms.
3)	Wastewater Tertiary Treatment:  SABESP is seeking technical assistance to comply with more stringent environmental norms for wastewater effluent.  SABESP operates several wastewater treatment processes, of which 40 are conventional activated secondary sludge and approximately 230 are stabilization ponds.  In some cases, there is a need for tertiary treatment to remove nitrogen and phosphorus from the effluent in order to comply with new state and federal norms.  Many of the stabilization pond treatment systems will also require further treatment to remove algae, reduce the fecal coliform level and improve the oxygen levels.
4)	Industrial Re-use of Wastewater Treatment Plant Effluents: SABESP operates 5 large wastewater treatment plants in the São Paulo metropolitan area and 2 wastewater treatment plants in the interior of the state with a total of 16 cubic meters per second of effluent that could potentially be re-used by industry.

USTDA has worked with SABESP in the past.  USTDA provided a $250,000 grant to SABESP (USTDA Activity Number 1996-561A) for technical assistance on the São Paulo Wastwater Treatment Plan. The DM consultant will be tasked with pursuing additional details from SABESP on the results of this previous technical assistance as part of the evaluation of the new request for funding.

The Companhia de Tecnologia de Saneamento Ambiental (CETESB) is the environmental protection agency for the State of São Paulo.  USTDA has also worked with CETESB, most recently in 2000 to partially fund technical assistance (USTDA Activity Number 2000-50016B).  CETESB has used the results of the original technical assistance to define the procedures and schedule for the environmental licensing of the approximately 7,000 service stations and fuel retailers located in the state of São Paulo.  

CETESB has requested technical assistance to develop a new program to reduce toxic industrial products in the state.  The State of São Paulo generates 54% of Brazil’s gross national product (GNP) and is home to more than 120,000 industries.  São Paulo represents about 71% of Brazil’s pharmaceutical production, 64.5% of plastic production, and 59% of chemical production.

In December 2002, the State of São Paulo changed its permitting legislation, which provided CETESB with new tools to more effectively guarantee environmental quality in the state.  Specifically, CETESB is seeking to develop a plan for the reduction of toxic chemicals.  CETESB is studying the possibility of implementing a program similar to the USEPA’s Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) and similar state-level programs in the United States.  The proposed scope of the technical assistance would identify the main toxic chemicals used in the top 10 industrial sectors in the state; quantify the use of these chemicals; prioritize the chemicals to be targeted by the program (e.g. based on quantity used, level of toxicity, potential pollution); research ways to create economic incentives for industries to reduce the use of toxic chemicals; and assist CETESB with the design of a program to reduce the use of toxic chemicals.  The implementation of a state-wide toxic chemical reduction program by CETESB is expected to drive industries to change some industrial processes in order to reduce the use of toxic chemicals.
