<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency intends to add an option for increased hours within each option period of contract   68-D-01-081 with Eastern Research Group Incorporated, pursuant to 41 USC 253(c)(1):  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS), and Emission Standards Division (ESD)has a requirement to complete standards development work on source categories for which a regulation has already been written or for which work has already been initiated.  No work on new source categories, or other source categories, will be initiated or included under this contract.  The primary purpose of this effort is to provide the required technical support for the development, implementation and review of National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP), New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) Standards, Control Technique Guidelines (CTG), and Alternative Control Technology (ACT) documents.  Specifically, the additional hours will provide support for some or all of the following source categories:  
Animal Feedlot Operations, Architectural and Industrial Maintenance Coatings, Asphalt Roofing and Processing, Boat Manufacturing, Commercial and Industrial Incinerators, Consumer Products, Halogenated Solvent Cleaners (Degreaser), Dry cleaning, Ethylene Processes, Hazardous Organic NESHAP, Industrial/Commercial/Institutional Boilers, Leaking Equipment, Municipal Solid Waste Landfills, Municipal Waste Combustors, Other Solid Waste Incinerators, Petroleum Refineries, Phosphate Fertilizers, Phosphoric Acid, Plastic Parts, Process Heaters, Pulp and Paper Production, Secondary Lead, Web Solvent Cleaning, and Wet Formed Fiberglass Mat.  
  ERG has provided support to the EPA, under previous contracts, for the development of National Air Pollution Emission Standards.  During this time period, ERG has supported the development of standards covering the source categories listed above.  The Agency has a substantial investment in the unique experience and knowledge that ERG has developed while supporting standards development activities for these source categories.  Only ERG has the knowledge and "know-how" to continue with the on-going work without an extensive training and start-up period.  The EPA anticipates that a total of 32,781 hours will be added to the contract.  NAICS No. 541620 applies with a size standard of $5M in average annual receipts over the last three years.  Interested parties who believe they are qualified to perform this effort must submit a written narrative statement of capability within 15 days of this notice to John M. Southerland Jr. at the above address for consideration by the Agency.  Responses must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet these requirements.  Capability statement should demonstrate the following:  1) Demonstrated relevant experience in the development of air pollution regulations including the development of National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP), New Source Performance Standards (NSPA), Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) Standards, Control Technique Guidelines (CTG), and Alternative Control Technology (ACT) documents; 2) Demonstrated relevant experience with the source categories listed above in conducting tasks used to develop air pollution standards, and in conducting related tasks such as emissions inventory and factor development, control technology evaluation, and industrial process engineering; experience in utilizing consensus building and meeting facilitation, particularly to develop environmental standards; 3) Offerors must provide resumes for proposed key personnel (no more than ten (10)) who have relevant experience and education in engineering and the environmental sciences; and 4) Demonstrated successful past performance of the offeror in contracts and subcontracts for similar work.  Work which would be considered similar includes; (1) air pollution regulation development, (2) emission estimation (at both the source and national level), (3) control technology evaluation, (4)cost estimation (both for specific emission control devices and nationwide), (5) data gathering and analysis, (6) residual risk assessment and health effects estimation, (7) consensus building, meeting facilitation, negotiation techniques, and outreach activities, and (8) litigation support.  Offerors must provide a list of contracts and subcontracts completed during the past three years and those currently in process.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days of this notice, the Government will proceed with the procurement of these services with Eastern Research Group.  Please contact John M. Southerland Jr concerning this notice at southerland.john@epa.gov See Numbered Notes 22 and 23. ****

<DESC>In the months following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and the Transportation Review Board (TRB) jointly conducted a security and emergency response survey of all State DOTs to help them assess vulnerability and preparedness.  The results of this survey indicated that 59% of the respondents had some surveillance capabilities on their bridges.  In order to better secure our structures, this number needs to be increased and the type of surveillance technologies upgraded.  The States are also overwhelmed by new technologies available for implementation, but lack the appropriate guidelines for choosing the technologies that will effectively secure our bridges and tunnels against terrorism.  The State transportation agencies and other private bridge operators (e.g. railroads) are seeking a menu of options for increasing surveillance and security of vulnerable structures.  The State highway agencies need better information on cost, effectiveness, design and applicability of state of the art technologies such as closed circuit cameras, electronic detection, monitoring, tracking and alarm systems, or security patrols.

The AASHTO Task Force on Transportation Security identified the need for this research as a priority.   It is also a step towards meeting FHWA’s goals to ensure the security of the transportation system for the movement of people and goods and of improving highway safety.  In order to assist the states and meet the goals, the Federal Highway Administration is initiating a national pooled fund study to identify state of the art surveillance and security technologies for bridges and tunnels.  

The state of the art technologies for bridge and tunnel surveillance identified in this study should assist the States in decision making and provide guidelines to determine the benefits of new technologies with the ultimate goal of improving the existing level of security.

The Government anticipates issuing a solicitation on or about 8 May 2003 by posting it on the website, www.fedbizopps.gov.  No written, telephone, facsimile or e-mail requests for the solicitation package will be accepted.  The proposal due date will be 30 days after the solicitation is posted.  The estimated award date is 10 Jul 2003.  Since this solicitation will only be available electronically, it will be the responsibility of interested parties to monitor the FedBizOpps website for both the solicitation and any solicitation amendments that may be issued.

<DESC>NA NAICS Code:	541512.  Basis for Sole Source Negotiations: Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302. The United States Department of Transportation, Research and Special Programs Administration, Volpe National Transportation Center (Volpe Center), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for technical support for implementation of the DynaMIT model at the Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT).  The DynaMIT model is a traffic predictor developed by MIT.  This procurement is part of an on-going project to integrate the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) DynaMIT model at the Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT) and to test the application and viability of automatic non-recurring congestion detection and traffic  management of the integrated system.  DynaMIT will be used to determine the baseline normal traffic condition.  Once the normal condition has been set, other systems will be used, along with other data sources, to determine the occurrence of an incident.  Upon detection of an incident, DynaMIT will be used to assess the impact of the incident and to provide predictive traffic information and guidance for implementing proactive traffic management strategies to mitigate the congestion.  The objectives of the contemplated contract are: (1) to assist LADOT in integrating and testing DynaMIT, CLAIRE and AIDA for automatic non-recurrent congestion detection and traffic management; (2) to build, calibrate and validate DynaMIT using the archived data collected from the test site; and (3) to refine  DynaMIT for incorporation into the integrated software system for the online test. Volpe Center market research evinces that MIT is uniquely qualified to meet this requirement.  This notice provides an opportunity for entities to submit a capability statement clearly establishing the capability to perform the services required to meet the contract objectives stated above.  This is not a request for technical proposals and no solicitation is available.

Following is information specific to the Competitive Bidding Event:

I. GENERAL
For the purpose of expediting price related discussions, the Contracting Officer has opted to conduct a competitive, anonymous, on-line reverse auction using the UNICOR Quicksource E-Sourcing website.   UNICOR refers to such an auction as a Competitive Bidding Event (“CBE”). For the sake of consistency and to avoid confusion, this solicitation will similarly refer to such auction as a CBE. However, use of this phrase shall not be construed to imply that this solicitation is being conducted under the procedures set forth at FAR Part 14, Sealed Bidding. Rather, this solicitation is being conducted under the procedures set forth at FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in conjunction with the policies and procedures for solicitation, evaluation, and award prescribed in FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.

During the CBE, Offerors will provide pricing through submission of electronic offers via the UNICOR Quicksource website.  The primary pricing competition for this solicitation will be through the online reverse auction.    Qualified Offerors will have the ability to submit revised pricing during the CBE in response to prices submitted by other offerors. The identity of offerors will not be revealed to each other during the CBE. The final such revision during the CBE will be considered the Offeror’s final proposal. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to conduct verbal or written discussions with respect to factors other than price with the Offerors at anytime prior to award. Only offerors that have been determined qualified will be permitted to participate in the CBE. Offerors who are deemed qualified will be notified by the Contracting Officer. All qualified Offerors must  Call:877/687-2320 to schedule a mandatory Quicksource training.
       

Offerors are NOT to submit pricing with their initial proposals. Offerors should submit all required information, except for pricing, by the deadline for submissions on May 15, 2003 at 2:00PM ET. Pricing will only be accepted through the CBE.

II. REVERSE AUCTION
a. During the CBE, Offerors may revise their initial pricing proposal through submission of electronic offers during the anonymous CBE. This CBE shall constitute discussions with the Offerors. The final such revision during the CBE will be considered the Offeror’s Final Proposal Revision (FPR).

b. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to suspend or cancel the CBE at any time. If the Contracting Officer cancels the CBE, Final Proposal Revisions will be requested by an amendment to the solicitation.

c. Notwithstanding FAR 52.215-5, Offerors will submit revised pricing only through the online UNICOR QuickSource Site. Offerors will not submit revised pricing via any other mechanism including but not limited to post, courier, fax, E-mail, or orally unless specifically requested by the Contracting Officer.

d. The CBE bidding period shall be set by the Contracting Officer as indicated in Section III, paragraph (a). Electronic offers shall be submitted by Offerors during the CBE period. If a market leading offer is submitted within the last minute of the time period, the time period shall be extended for two additional minute(s) beyond the scheduled closing. The end of the last minute during which revised offers are permitted as addressed in this paragraph, shall be considered the end of the CBE bidding period.

e. Any Offeror experiencing difficulties during a CBE must notify the UNICOR QuickSource Helpdesk immediately at T: 877/687-2320. “Difficulties” include any event or problem, which interferes with the Offeror’s ability to participate in the CBE and may include, but is not limited to: data entry errors, software problems, or hardware problems. Offerors will have five minutes after a Lot goes into “Pending” status to notify the UNICOR QuickSource Helpdesk of any problems. If the Contracting Officer judges that any Offeror has been disadvantaged by a problem, they may address the problem and return the Lot to “Open” status.

f. Any and all Offeror contact with FreeMarkets, the provider of the UNICOR QuickSource website, is for the sole purpose of facilitating the CBE and shall not be considered discussions with the Offeror within the meaning of FAR Part 15.   

g. For purposes of FAR 52.203-2, and in accordance with subparagraph (c) thereof, submission of a proposal by the Offeror shall be considered certification by the Offeror that the only knowing disclosure by the Offeror of its prices to any other Offeror will be during the CBE. The Offeror further certifies that disclosure by the Offeror of its prices during the CBE shall not be for the purposes of restricting competition.

h. UNICOR reserves the right to reject any or all quotes received for any or all lots.

III. CBE PARAMETERS
a. The date of the Competitive Bidding Event is May 29, 2003. The Competitive Bidding Event shall be MT642-03. There will be 5 lots. The bid opening time shall commence at 10:00 am Eastern Daylight Time. The bidding period time shall expire at 10:30 am EDT unless a quote is submitted for Lot 1 within the two minute of the bid opening time period for Lot 1.

The bidding period for Lot 2 shall expire no less than seven (7) minutes after the actual expiration of the bidding period for Lot 1.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends on entering into a sole source simplified acquisition with Constance Seymour, Salisbury, MD, under the authority of FAR subsection 13.106-1(b).  This procurement is for continued support of the Standard Reference Data Program Website.  The site must have a set of linked pages that will enable users to navigate the "NIST Scientific and Technical Databases" while meeting the Section 508 accessibility standards, and it must have a series of online Journal of Physical and Chemical Reference Data (JPCRD) articles containing the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) Chemical Solubility Data Series.  The contractor must have detailed knowledge of the site content and experience with typesetting scientific publications or similar experience, including: computerized coding for displaying equations, Greek characters, mathematical symbols, scientific equations and foreign alphabets, and the ability to display these symbols in various ways on Web pages.  This work also requires Webmaster experience and familiarity with the use of software for developing Web sites, namely, the Dream Weaver software package, hypertext markup language (HTML) and the creation of graphics.  The contractor must have knowledge of scientific numbers, chemical equations, mathematical equations, and Greek and mathematical symbols.  The sole source determination is based on the Contractor's unique expertise and detailed knowledge of the structure and composition of the Standard Reference Data website as well as: Web development tools; relational databases, especially Access; SQL; the use of Web browsers for displaying tabular data; the use of HTML; bibliographic notation; chemical equations and math equations; accurate representation of chemical formulas, chemical names, and CAS numbers; and rudimentary knowledge of general chemistry.  Due to the fluctuation in work required, it is anticipated that a labor-hour type purchase order will be awarded, with a base and two option years.  No RFQ package is available.  Any interested party may submit, in writing, their capability statement to respond to this requirement.  However, a determination by the Government to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This notice of intent is not a request for quotes.  If no affirmative responses are received by May 1, 2003 at 9:00a.m. the Contracting Officer will proceed with the award to Constance Seymour.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to enter into a sole source purchase order with Dr. Vyacheslav B. Podobedov for near-infrared measurements of the discrete and continuum water-vapor spectrum for use in atmospheric transmission modeling and remote sensing.  THz measurements of water-vapor and magnetic-dipole O2 continuum absorption to assess detection limits is also apart of the requirement.  Specific requirements are for someone with extensive expertise in both optical design and molecular spectroscopy at the level of a Ph.D. scientist in Physics with a specialization in Optics, and someone who is familiar with NIST optical and mechanical design capabilities, the multipass cell optical system, and the operation of the Fourier-transform spectrometer to be used in several of the tasks. Dr. Vyacheslav Podobedov uniquely meets this required criteria, as evidenced by his more than 100 publications in this area.  The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed price purchase order on or about May 16, 2003.  The proposed requirement is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106(b).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, the government will consider all capability statements received by May 16, 2003.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  

THE TECHNOLOGY:  The invention is an algorithm for controlling a manufacturing welding/coatings process known as ElectroSpark Deposition (ESD).  Because the electrode contacts the surface in ESD rather than maintaining a stand-off distance to control the arc, precise control of the applied pressure on the electrode is necessary to produce acceptable coatings.  The invention uses a real-time current data to select the highest single value for every five current pulses.  This value is then used to proportionally represent the applied electrode force and fed back into the ESD process to control this force.   In another aspect of the invention, derived values for current/applied pressure are used to develop indices for acceptable applied pressure set point for various combinations of substrate/electrode materials.  These indices are then input into a Hand Held Applicator (manual ESD device) in which a sound alarm is used to alert the operator whenever he gets outside of the defined set point range.  

NOTE:   THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.   Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company’s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

<DESC>SSA has a requirement for ongoing Clerical Support Services at its Headquarters folder storage MEGASITE located in Baltimore, MD. This requirement will be WHOLLY SET ASIDE AS A COMPETITIVE 8(a) Commercial Item/Service in accordance with FAR Parts 12,15 and 19.  SSA anticipates awarding a Requiremnts type contract with the initial Period of Performance being August 25, 2003 to August 24, 2004 with Options for four(4) additional one year periods. The applicable NAICS Code is 561210 with a Size Standard of $6 million. SSA will make award on a Best Value Basis considering Technical Capability, Experience and Past Performance in addition to Price. The Megasite currently has @ 145 FT and 25 PT contract employees. The Megasite currently maintains approximately 6 million beneficiary folders primarily from its Baltimore, MD Program Service Center (PSC). The contractor shall provide all necessary management, supervision, personnel, training, reports, insurance, materials, services, equipment and supplies necessary to provide clerical support services at the Megasite facility.  Any permits, insurance and licenses required to comply with all Federal, State and municipal laws and ordinances shall also be included. The Megasite utilizes a Terminal Digit Filing System (TDFS). Claims folders are filed in the Megasite by terminal digit.  The SSN is comprised of nine numbers which are broken down into three sections: Example:123 (Area)-45(Group)-6789(Serial)The last four numbers, known as the serial number, are used as the common identifier to control, file and retrieve claims folders. The contractor shall perform the following folder-related services (1) Folder Refiles. Refiling requires the contractor to put a folder back into the same box in numerical order from which the folder was taken initially. Folder refiles are a high priority.  Folders must be returned to the appropriate box to allow for other related services such as dropfiles and folder retrievals to be performed. (2) Folder Retrievals. Requests for SSNs from PSCs, Field Offices and other SSA offices are entered into the PCACS case control system. PCACS automatically places all the requested SSNs from a particular location in numerical order on a list that is electronically transmitted overnight to be available to the contractor. The contractor will use however many employees it takes to process the list that day.  The contractor will take that list and any other special recalls received during the day and retrieve the requested folders from the pertinent file. Individual folders requested by Field Offices or other SSA offices will be packaged for Fedex shipment the same day. (3) Dropfile Material. A dropfile represents any paper material that needs to be placed in a folder.  Multiple sheets for the same folder count as one dropfile.  Dropfile material includes single sheets of paper and/or bundles of paper. The requirement is that this material be correctly dropfiled within two workdays of receipt.(4)Temporary Folder Preparation: Temporary folders are prepared for dropfile material when the permanent folder is temporarily located outside of OCO. (5)Sequencing. The task of sequencing is a process to insure that folders within each active file remain in numerical SSN order. Sequencing is a means of maintaining accuracy standards and the integrity of the files.  It also increases the ease and accuracy of all folder related activities at the Megasite.  Sequencing services may be performed yearly during the course of each contract year at the request of the Project Manager. (6)Files Inactivation: Once or twice a year SSA will remove the inactive folders from the Megasite and send the folders to be maintained in a Federal Records Center (FRC) or the National Record Center.  SSA will provide the contractor with a listing of all inactive folders SSNs with SSNXs that are to be shipped to the FRC or NRC. (7) Validation: It is extremely important to be able to quickly find every folder that is requested. Many times folders are misfiled causing NIF situations, which reduce the Government’s ability to properly service the public.  SSA will order a validation at the beginning of the base year and the beginning of the third option year. (7)PCACS is a computer terminal and software system used by SSA as a case control system to pinpoint the exact physical location and movement of the Agency’s tens of millions of folders.  The contractor will have to learn this system in order to determine into which active file a piece of material or a folder should be filed. Protective security requirements require Contractor personnel who have access to SSA facilities shall be required to undergo a background investigation, which will be conducted by the Government.  Such investigation shall include a check by fingerprints and a statement of personal history. Service Contract Act provisions apply. Refer to FAR 52.222-50, Non-displacement of Qualified Workers, (May 1999). Any qualified 8(a)firm which believes it has the relevant experience, personnel, facilities, systems, etc. to perform the described tasks should notify the Contracting Officer by e-mail or fax of their interest in this requirement. The solicitation, when issued, will be available on the FEDBIZOPPS WEB Site (www2.eps.gov) in @ 2 weeks.  The solicitation will include information regarding the current contract including pricing data.  Requests for historical information received prior to release of the RFP will not be honored. A SITE SURVEY will be scheduled at a later date.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U. S. Postal Service is soliciting Qualification Statements from construction firms desiring to be placed on a list of prequalified design-build general contractors for construction of new or expanded postal facilities in Nevada Sierra District.  This area consists of the State of Nevada and that portion of northern California including all or part of the counties of Modoc, Lassen, Plumas, Sierra, Nevada, Placer, El Dorado, and Alpine.  The buildings are expected to range in size from approximately 8,000 square feet to 50,000 square feet, with a construction cost of $1.0 million to $7.5 million, and are categorized as carrier annexes, postal retail facilities, delivery distribution centers, main post offices, stations or branches.  No fixed mechanization is included in these projects. Only the most qualified contractors will be prequalified.  To be considered for prequalification, respondents must demonstrate a minimum of five years of design-build experience and have completed a minimum of two comparable projects over the past five years.  Comparable projects for the purpose of this solicitation are defined as design-build new construction or expansion projects of commercial/light industrial type facilities with a minimum of 20,000 square feet in size and a construction cost of at least $2.0 million.  Qualification Statements will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria:  Experience and references (60%); organization (25%); safety (15%).  Other factors that will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis are:  backlog, financial capability, bonding, banking, responsibility and affirmation.  The Postal Service will issue individual project solicitations to prequalified firms only.  Each solicitation will request a fixed price proposal.  Prequalified firms will have the option to submit a proposal for one or all of the projects as they become available.  Prequalified design/build firms are not obligated to submit proposals in response to a Postal Service solicitation.  Awards of individual contracts will be made to the firm offering the best value to the Postal Service within available funding in accordance with evaluation criteria stated in individual project solicitations. The Postal Service retains the right to:  (1) Delete from the prequalified list any design/build firm that is no longer deemed to be responsible or is otherwise ineligible to receive a contract award pursuant to the Postal Service Purchasing Manual. (2) Prequalify additional design/build firms that will be eligible to receive solicitations for facilities to be constructed and/or expanded.  This right will be exercised when the number of existing prequalified firms is not sufficient to ensure adequate competition. (3) Issue open-market solicitations for specific design/build projects when determined by the contracting officer to be in the best interest of the Postal Service.  This list of prequalified firms will have periodic maintenance for adding/deleting firms as required with a minimum review by the end of November of each year.  Qualification Statement packages may be obtained by sending an email request to gzipagan@email.usps.gov or nyoung@email.usps.gov.  Qualification Statement packages will be emailed to the requestor.

To be considered for prequalification, respondents must demonstrate a minimum of five years of design-build experience and have completed a minimum of two comparable projects over the past five years.  Comparable projects for the purpose of this solicitation are defined as design-build new construction or expansion projects of commercial/light industrial type facilities with a minimum of 20,000 square feet in size and a construction cost of at least $2.0 million.  Qualification Statements will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria:  Experience and references (60%); organization (25%); safety (15%).  Other factors that will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis are:  backlog, financial capability, bonding, banking, responsibility and affirmation.  The Postal Service will issue individual project solicitations to prequalified firms only.  Each solicitation will request a fixed price proposal.  Prequalified firms will have the option to submit a proposal for one or all of the projects as they become available.  Prequalified design/build firms are not obligated to submit proposals in response to a Postal Service solicitation.  Awards of individual contracts will be made to the firm offering the best value to the Postal Service within available funding in accordance with evaluation criteria stated in individual project solicitations. The Postal Service retains the right to:  (1) Delete from the prequalified list any design/build firm that is no longer deemed to be responsible or is otherwise ineligible to receive a contract award pursuant to the Postal Service Purchasing Manual. (2) Prequalify additional design/build firms that will be eligible to receive solicitations for facilities to be constructed and/or expanded.  This right will be exercised when the number of existing prequalified firms is not sufficient to ensure adequate competition. (3) Issue open-market solicitations for specific design/build projects when determined by the contracting officer to be in the best interest of the Postal Service.  This list of prequalified firms will have periodic maintenance for adding/deleting firms as required with a minimum review by the end of November of each year.  Qualification Statement packages may be obtained by sending an email request to gzipagan@email.usps.gov or nyoung@email.usps.gov.  Qualification Statement packages will be emailed to the requestor.

<DESC>The contractor shall develop and conduct data collection for the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2005 NHANES).  Before data collection the contractor shall pretest and implement all procedures for this survey, including updating the existing computer assisted personal interviews, administration of household and mobile examination center interviews, and conduct of health examinations.  The data collection system will be totally automated and integrated at all sites of data collection and will include receipt and control of test results from numerous contract and government laboratories and other contractors.  All information will be stored in digital format and may include such information as digitized images or photographs.  The automated system will allow continuous monitoring of the quality of the data by CDC and the contractor, produce reports of examination findings to be provided to participants, and result in public use data files within one year of data collection.  The data will be collected over a period of four, six, or eight years depending on the sequencing of phases and the options selected.  In the standard six-year data collection period the survey will go to about ninety areas throughout the United States. Public data release will occur at the end of the first two years and every two years thereafter.  NHANES will examine approximately 5,000 sample persons per year.  Specifications for the primary sampling units and sample design will be provided to the contractor.  The estimated period of performance will be ten years.
	
	The proposed Scope of Work contains two optional surveys and some optional interview and examination components.  The optional survey, Community HANES, will be a local survey where the sample is a small, defined population.  
	
	The contractor shall adapt from the existing software and hardware the system necessary to develop, maintain, and appropriately upgrade the totally automated and integrated data collection and quality control system to the specifications of NCHS.  The system must be able to adapt to survey content changes that may occur as the data collection continues.  All regulations and mandated hardware and software requirements will be specified in the RFP.  
	
	The estimated release date for this RFP is approximately 15 days after this publication, and closing date will be approximately 90 days after issue date.  All requests for copies of this RFP must be in writing addressed to the attention of Ms. Elisa Hillman and reference RFP Number 200-N-00740.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.

The National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information (NCADI), established in conformance with the Public Health Service Act, as amended by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, the Omnibus Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, the ADAMHA Reorganization Act of 1992, and the H.R. 4365, the Children's Health Act of 2000, supports and promotes the goals of demand reduction for the substance abuse field.  Since 1987, the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information has served at the Nation’s single point of entry in the Federal government for comprehensive, customer&#64979;friendly information about substance abuse prevention, intervention, and treatment.  NCADI operations have expanded significantly to meet the order fulfillment needs of the ONDCP National Youth Anti&#64979;Drug Media Campaign, SAMHSA’s targeted press efforts, CSAP’s dissemination and application initiatives as well as its highly targeted public health education campaigns, CSAT’s knowledge application initiative and public affairs efforts, as well as the dissemination efforts of NIAAA, NIDA, and the Department of Education.

SAMHSA’s National Mental Health Information Center (NMHIC) was established as the national focal point of contact about treatment and support services for mental health and mental illness. The Information Center provides appropriate, user-friendly information and referrals to; local, state and Federal agencies, professional organizations and clearinghouses, or national, state, and community mental health organizations and associations.. Under section 520(b)(10), of the Public Health Service Act, CMHS is mandated to establish a mental health information Clearinghouse. It also provides information dissemination support to CMHS programs including: the Emergency Services and Disaster Relief Program (during times of disaster), the National Public Information/Education Campaign on Children's Mental Health Services and the School Violence Prevention Program. NMHIC also serves to disseminate information developed by CMHS programs about mental health services to adults with severe mental illnesses, children and adolescents with serious emotional disturbances and family members. The Clearinghouse also assures the widespread dissemination of such information to States, political subdivisions, educational agencies and institutions, treatment and prevention service providers, and the general public.

The Clearinghouse is a contracted program which exists to serve a wide variety of Federal dissemination needs, but its ultimate success is based on its ability to reach the intended target audiences of SAMHSA and its Centers as well as the ONDCP and our other Federal partners.  These target audiences include, but are not limited to, general public, prevention and treatment practitioners, policymakers, community organizers, youth, educators, health care providers, faith-based organizations, social service providers, and the media.

The National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information (NCADI), established in conformance with the Public Health Service Act, as amended by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, the Omnibus Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, the ADAMHA Reorganization Act of 1992, and the H.R. 4365, the Children's Health Act of 2000, supports and promotes the goals of demand reduction for the substance abuse field.  Since 1987, the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information has served at the Nation’s single point of entry in the Federal government for comprehensive, customer&#64979;friendly information about substance abuse prevention, intervention, and treatment.  NCADI operations have expanded significantly to meet the order fulfillment needs of the ONDCP National Youth Anti&#64979;Drug Media Campaign, SAMHSA’s targeted press efforts, CSAP’s dissemination and application initiatives as well as its highly targeted public health education campaigns, CSAT’s knowledge application initiative and public affairs efforts, as well as the dissemination efforts of NIAAA, NIDA, and the Department of Education.

SAMHSA’s National Mental Health Information Center (NMHIC) was established as the national focal point of contact about treatment and support services for mental health and mental illness. The Information Center provides appropriate, user-friendly information and referrals to; local, state and Federal agencies, professional organizations and clearinghouses, or national, state, and community mental health organizations and associations.. Under section 520(b)(10), of the Public Health Service Act, CMHS is mandated to establish a mental health information Clearinghouse. It also provides information dissemination support to CMHS programs including: the Emergency Services and Disaster Relief Program (during times of disaster), the National Public Information/Education Campaign on Children's Mental Health Services and the School Violence Prevention Program. NMHIC also serves to disseminate information developed by CMHS programs about mental health services to adults with severe mental illnesses, children and adolescents with serious emotional disturbances and family members. The Clearinghouse also assures the widespread dissemination of such information to States, political subdivisions, educational agencies and institutions, treatment and prevention service providers, and the general public.

The Clearinghouse is a contracted program which exists to serve a wide variety of Federal dissemination needs, but its ultimate success is based on its ability to reach the intended target audiences of SAMHSA and its Centers as well as the ONDCP and our other Federal partners.  These target audiences include, but are not limited to, general public, prevention and treatment practitioners, policymakers, community organizers, youth, educators, health care providers, faith-based organizations, social service providers, and the media.  As such, achieving high levels of customer satisfaction across all tasks are a primary focus for the NCADI contract.

The Agency has a substantial investment in the unique experience and knowledge that RTI has developed while supporting standards development activities for these source categories.  Only RTI has the knowledge and "know-how" to continue with the on-going work without an extensive training and start-up period.  The EPA anticipates that a total of 47,000 hours will be added to the contract.  NAICS No. 541620 applies with a size standard of $5M in average annual receipts over the last three years.  Interested parties who believe they are qualified to perform this effort must submit a written narrative statement of capability within 15 days of this notice to Tillie Newsome at the above address for consideration by the Agency.

<DESC>Solicitation DAAE30-03-R-0601 is amended to include, in full text, DFARS clause 252.232-7007, Limitation of Government's Obligation, Aug 1993 252.232-7007 Limitation of Government's Obligation.  (AUG 1993) (a) Contract line item(s) [0001] through [NA] are incrementally funded.  For these item(s), the sum of [$________ - To Be Determined after evaluation of proposals but prior to contract award] of the total price is presently available for payment and allotted to this contract.  An allotment schedule is set forth in paragraph (i) of this clause. (b) For item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including reimbursement in the event of termination of those  item(s) for the Government's convenience, approximates the total amount currently allotted to the contract.  The Contractor will not be obligated to continue work on those item(s) beyond that point.  The Government will not be obligated in any event to reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for those item(s) regardless of anything to the contrary in the clause entitled "Termination for Convenience of the Government."  As used in this clause, the total amount payable by the Government in the event of termination of applicable contract line item(s) for convenience includes cost, profit, and estimated termination settlement costs for those items(s). (c) Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in  paragraph (i) of this clause, the Contractor will notify the Contracting Officer in writing at least ninety days prior to the date when, in the Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including any cost for termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract for performance of the applicable item(s).  The notification will state (1) the estimated date when that point will be reached and (2) an estimate of additional funding, if any, needed to continue performance of applicable line items up to the next scheduled date for allotment of funds identified in paragraph (i) of this clause, or  to a mutually agreed upon substitute date.  The notification will also advise the Contracting Officer of the estimated amount of additional funds that will be required for the timely performance of the item(s) funded pursuant to this clause, for subsequent period as may be specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (i) of this clause, or otherwise agreed to by the parties.  If after such notification additional funds are not allotted by the date identified in the Contractor's notification, or by an agreed substitute date, the Contracting Officer will terminate any item(s) for which additional funds have not be allotted, pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled "Termination for Convenience of the Government." (d) When additional funds are allotted for continued performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause the parties will agree  as to the period of contract performance which will be covered by the funds. The provisions of paragraph (b) through (d) of this clause will apply in like manner to the additional allotted funds and agreed substitute date, and the contract will be modified accordingly. (e) If, solely by reason of failure of the Government to allot additional funds, by the dates indicated below, in amounts sufficient for timely performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor incurs additional costs or is delayed in the performance of the work under this contract and if additional funds are allotted, an equitable adjustment will be made in the price or prices (including appropriate target, billing, and ceiling prices where applicable) of the  item(s), or in the time of delivery, or both.  Failure to agree to any such equitable adjustment hereunder will be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the clause entitled "Disputes." (f) The Government may at any time prior to termination allot additional funds for the performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause.  (g) The termination provisions of this clause do not limit the rights of the Government under the clause entitled "Default."  The provisions of this clause are limited to the work and allotment of funds for the contract line item(s) set forth in paragraph  (a) of this clause.  This clause no longer applies once the contract is fully funded except with regard to the rights or obligations of the parties concerning equitable adjustments negotiated under paragraphs (d) or (e) of this clause. (g) Nothing in this clause affects the right of the Government to terminate this contract pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled "Termination for Convenience of the Government." (i) The parties contemplate that the Government will allot funds to the contract in accordance with the following schedule: On execution of contract................$ (month) (day), 199x.......................$ (month) (day), 199y.......................$ (month) (day), 199z.......................$ *To be inserted after negotiation. (End of clause) Acknowledgement of this amendment in addition to amendment one (1), which was issued on 3/21/03, shall be provided to this office with your offer.   The response date remains unchanged.  Offers are due by 4 P.M. on 4/21/03.

<DESC>1.A site visit was conducted on subject solicitation on 15 Apr at 1400 in the Education Center.  

2.The following describes the room as noted by the contractors.   The ceiling is approximately 9 feet high and is comprised of 2 foot by 4 foot hanging ceiling tiles with approximately 24 inches clearance above.  The room is approximately 32 feet by 20 feet with carpeted floors and fluorescent tube lighting.  The air conditioning unit makes no noticeable noise.

3.Mr. Hutchins, 14 CS, provided the following information to the contractors.  The system will be run on a T-1 line, which will be installed on or about 15 May 2003.  System ties into all Mississippi colleges and must have the capability for the instructor to transmit instruction from this site.  The contractor will recommend setup of the room.  The preference for the monitors is to be placed on moveable carts.  

4.The following questions were asked by the contractors:

a.Would the base be interested in purchasing some of the less technical equipment, monitors and VCR, separate of this solicitation.  Answer.  No, we need to have a turnkey operation.  Once the contractor is finished we should have a fully operational system.
b.What is the preference for the microphones?  The norm for the MIVN system is push to talk table microphones versus hanging microphones.
c.Can the equipment be drop shipped to the base?  Yes, the base will receive and hold the equipment for the contractor.  Government acceptance occurs only after installation is complete.  The shipping address is:  14 CS/SCX, Attn:  Mr. Chester Hutchins, 151 E Street, Columbus AFB, MS  39710-9101.
d.Is there a preference between a VCR or CD for recording?  Yes, a VCR is required.  The purpose of the recording capability is to provide the instruction to student who may have missed the class.
e.How many individuals from the base will require training?  At a minimum four, one from the Communication Squadron and three from the Education Center.
f.Will the contractor have uninterrupted access to the classroom for the estimated 4 – 5 day installation period.  Yes, the classroom will be set aside for installation.  Normal hours of operation on base are 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m.
g.Is security of the system a concern?  Yes, the contractor may recommend a lockable box or cabinet for the system.
h.Is the award criteria price alone?  No.  Price is a factor, but assured connectivity to the MIVN system is equally as important.  A technical representative from Mississippi State University will aid in the evaluation of the bids to ensure connectivity with the existing system.

For clarification of the requirement specified in Section 7 -  Certification of Compliance of Vault With Specified Technical Requirements. 

This requirement can be met in one of two ways - a vendor with an existing vault built to the original DoD Class A-1 structure requirements that is currently approved for classified storage, as well as the newer GSA Federal Specification AA-V-2737. Either certification must allow for storage of Top Secret material.  Award of the contract to the winning company is contingent upon submission of an acceptable certification by the offeror accompanying their proposal prior to award.  NSF will not sponsor vendors for clearances.

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment 003, for vendors interested in providing a Hydraulic press brake is to address and answer questions requested by vendors. The Request for Quotations (RFQ) due date is changed to April 21, 2003 at 3:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time. The following questions were asked by vendors: Question: 1.  BEP’s requirements list a Y axis adjustment of 8”.  Please advise if you would accept a Y axis adjustment of 6.3”. Answer: BEP has requested specific criteria in our Statement of Work (SOW) based on our needs, we plan on using “C” type multi-punching tools in our brake. Y axis adjustment may be critical to accepting this tooling. Question: 2.  BEP’s requirements list a “tilting gauge bar” in Paragraph H on page two.  What we would look to provide is the X, Y, and R axes to include flip-up type stops on the back gauge bar to prevent damage to the gauging device when bending certain types of parts.  In addition to this flip-up feature, we also have a retract pinch point which can be engaged at the control by the operator based on the type of work that is being performed.  Answer: BEP’s intent is to prevent damage to our gauging device.  However, BEP has had operations that required fade-out. Question: 3. Will BEP accept fax bid submissions? If so, to what number can we fax our bid? Answer: As spelled out in the original electronic posting, quotations may be mailed to the BEP Office of Procurement, Attn: Christina Tayman, 14th and C Sts,S.W., Washington, D.C. 20228-0001 or faxed to Christina Tayman at (202) 874-2200 or (202) 874-3235.

Telephone requests will not be honored.All responsible sources may submit an offer upon receipt of the RFQ,which, shall be considered by the Agency.  4.  Modifications 001 and 002 do not appear as documented amendments for signature.  Please confirm if this is the case because the RFQ document shows a closing date of April 3, 2003? Answer: Per Amendment 002, the RFP due date for RFQ-03-0303 was extended to April 17, 2003 at 3:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time.

<DESC>The U. S. Coast Guard is considering whether or not to set aside an acquisition for HUBZone concerns only.  The acquisition is for drydock repairs to USCG 41 Foot Utility Boats (UTB) located in the Group Mobile area.  This contract will cover a base year and four options years, with approximately three boats repaired per year.  The estimated value of this procurement per year is under $100,000.  The NAICS Code is 336611.  The small business size standard is less than 1,000 employees.  The scope of this acquisition is for the drydocking and repairing of various items on the 41 foot boats.  The work will include, but is not limited to:  welding repairs; renewing hull seam welding; renewing aluminum frames, stiffeners, and brackets; renewing skeg; air testing skeg; renewing rubrail; removing and reinstalling rubrail; renewing rub rail fasteners; cleaning and inspecting diesel fuel tank; renewing cabin and pilot house; inspecting and preserving cabin top; removing and reinstalling cabin top windows; preserving cabin top interior; preserving cabin top exterior; renewing stern tube; removing and reinstalling main diesel engine; removing, inspecting and reinstalling propeller shaft; renewing strut; renewing propeller shaft coupling; performing minor repair and reconditioning of propeller; straightening shaft; realigning engine; renewing propulsion shaft stern tube bearings; renewing propulsion shaft strut bearings; removing and reinstalling propeller; renewing valves; removing, inspecting, and reinstalling rudder assembly; removing, inspecting, and reinstalling deck cleats; renewing rudder bushing; preserving main deck and well deck; preserving underwater body (Intersleek); preserving underwater body (epoxy); preserving freeboard; renewing engine room watertight hatch; renewing engine room watertight scuttle; providing temporary logistics, and routine drydocking.  All welding and brazing shall be accomplished by trained welders who have been certified by the applicable regulatory code performance qualification procedures.  The boats’ homeports are located within Group Mobile.  The U. S. Coast Guard may award two contracts for these repairs:  one for the western area of operations, and one for the eastern area of operations.  There are three boats in the western area of operations, which covers Pascagoula, MS, and Dauphin Island, AL.  The area covers a line bearing 180 degrees true from a point at 30-23.9N, 088-49W (Ocean Springs, MS) to the eastern tip of Deer Island, southward on a bearing of 171 degrees true to Dog Keys Pass LB1, and southeast on a bearing of 161 true to 200 NM offshore to the Highway 59 bridge (Gulf Shores, AL) out 180 degrees true to 200 NM offshore.  There are five boats in the eastern area of operations, which covers Pensacola, FL, to Panama City, FL.  The area covers the Highway 59 bridge out 180 degrees true to 200 NM offshore to a line bearing 200 degrees true from a point at 30-00N 083-50W (the Econfina River, FL) out to 200 NM offshore.  All stations’ inland boundaries are the coastal and inland waters between their respective boundaries except Station Dauphin Island, which runs north in the headwaters of Mobile Bay up to the CSX railroad at Mile 14.  The 200 NM offshore is the Group boundary, but the 41 foot UTBs are limited to 30 NM offshore unless they receive a waiver.  The performance period for each boat is twenty-one (21) calendar days.  The place of performance is not geographically restricted, however, for the boat to travel by water, it must remain within its area of operation.  Any contractor providing for work to be accomplished at a commercial location outside the area of operation will have to transport the boat by land at the contractor’s expense, which shall be included in the amount bid.  At the present time, the acquisition is expected to be issued as a small business set aside.  However, in accordance with FAR 19.1305, if your firm is HUBZone certified and intends to submit an offer on this acquisition, please respond by e-mail to gmcdaniel@mlca.uscg.mil or by fax (757) 628-4676.  Questions may be referred to Ms. Gail McDaniel at (757) 628-4649.  In your response please include the following:  (a) a positive statement of your intent to submit a bid for this solicitation as a prime contractor; (b) evidence of experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, points of contact, and telephone numbers;(c) past performance references with points of contact and phone numbers; and (d) if your company does not own a drydock, a letter of commitment from the company providing the drydock during the performance period of this availability.  At least two references are requested, but more are desirable. Contractors are reminded that should this acquisition become a HUBZone set aside, FAR 52.219-3, Notice of Total HUBZone Set-Aside, will apply, which requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern or employees of other HUBZone small business concerns.  Your response is required by April 25, 2003. All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on a HUBZone set aside.  Failure to submit all information requested may result in pursuing this requirement as a small business set aside. A decision on whether this will be pursued as a HUBZone small business set aside or as a small business set aside will be posted in www.fedbizopps.gov.

<DESC>Amendment 2 has been issued for this statement of interest which  replaces the NAICS code.  The new NAICS code for this is 562910, Environmental Remediation Services (500 employees).

CH2M HILL Hanford Group, Inc. (CH2M HILL) in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Tank Farm Contract, is soliciting interest and information from qualified firms having the capability of performing analytical services (laboratory management; inorganic, organic and radiochemical analyses; methods development and process troubleshooting) for the analysis of radioactive and/or hazardous waste samples.  The DOE has announced the pending transfer of the 222-S Laboratory to CH2M HILL, the primary user of the Laboratory’s analytical services.  In addition to supporting CH2M HILL, the Laboratory provides site-wide analytical services for the Hanford site.  CH2M HILL is interested in contracting with a nationally recognized laboratory organization to gain commercial efficiencies in operations. 

This will be a local business preference solicitation. To be considered local, interested parties must be operating in the local vicinity of the Hanford site for the duration of any resulting contract.  For interested parties not presently operating within the local vicinity, but plan to respond to the proposed solicitation, sufficient details showing such planning so as to be fully operational at the time of contract award (September 2003) shall be required to be submitted with their proposal.   

Further it is the intent of CH2M HILL to provide the maximum practical opportunity for small businesses to participate in contract performance.  Therefore, small businesses, small women-owned businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and small service-disabled businesses are encouraged to apply and/or participate in teaming agreements to participate in contract performance.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for determining size status is 541380.     

Interested parties are hereby requested to review and provide comments on the information provided herein.  Closing date for this RFI is May 14, 2003. An informational session on the existing analytical services will be conducted on April 24, 2003.  Tour schedules of the facility will be announced at the meeting. Participants will be advised where to meet for the tour.  The tour will be restricted to two individuals for each firm who will participate.  A draft Request for Proposal (RFP) is anticipated to be released on or about June 18, 2003.  There will be a second tour conducted after the draft RFP has been issued for those parties who wish to attend.


CH2M HILL is requesting interest and information on 3 options for analytical services:
1.	Management and direction of the 222-S Analytical Laboratory on the Hanford site that is being transferred to CH2M HILL, as a member of the CH2M HILL team.
2.	Becoming an approved subcontractor to CH2M HILL in charge of the analytical services scope performing the analyses for CH2M HILL including absorbing the current equipment and staff (augmented as appropriate) into the subcontract organization to complete the necessary scope.
3.	Performing some or all of the analytical services scope at offsite operations 

The successful Contractor shall be required to accept the Labor Agreement in place with the Hanford Atomic Metal Trade Council (HAMTC-AFL-CIO) at the time of contract award. The terms of this Labor Agreement will be applicable to these employees until the Contractor executes a new labor contract with HAMTC.  The successful Contractor will be required to offer employment to transferring HAMTC represented personnel.  These bargaining unit employees will become employees of the Contractor as of the effective date of the Contract for Options 2 and 3.  Any grievances/arbitrations occurring after the start of this work shall be the responsibility of the Contractor.  The number of personnel, craft specialties, wage rates, etc. will be made available in the draft RFP.

The successful Contractor will be expected to consider offering positions to the existing exempt and non-exempt staff.  The number of exempt and non-exempt personnel and their specialties will be made available in the draft RFP.

The existing equipment and instrumentation located in the 222-S Laboratory will be made available to the Contractor for Options 1 and 2, provided it is deemed suitable for release under Government and CH2M HILL procedures.  Equipment and instrumentation that can be made available and is deemed suitable for use by the Contractor will be made available for use at no additional cost to the Contractor. 

The successful Contractor shall be required to give priority to CH2M HILL’s and other Hanford site contractors’ analytical services requirements.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement.  This is a sources sought synopsis only.   The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifications (HUBZone 8(a), 8(a), HUBZone, Small Disadvantage and Large Business) relative to this 541690 NAICS Code. Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate determinations about potential sources only.  The intended contract shall provide the Government the option to extend the contract in one-year increments for a base and four option years. 

After review of the responses to this sources sought announcement a solicitation announcement may be published in the Federal Business Opportunities at a later time.  

Responses to this notice shall include company name, address, point of contact, size of business pursuant to North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS) and must respond to the following questions: 1) Is your business a large or small business? 2) Does your firm qualify as a small or small disadvantaged business? 3) If disadvantaged specify under which disadvantaged group is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act?  4) Are you considered a certified HUBZone firm? 5) Are you considered woman-owned or operated business? 6) Are you a certified Service–Disabled Veteran Owned or Veteran Owned? 

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) is interested in highly experienced organizations able to maintain the CSAT Services Accountability improvement System (SAIS).  

Under the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), the Center is responsible for monitoring program performance across all of its budgetary lines.  Recent experience with the Performance Assessment Rating Tool (PART) process as well as an evaluation of existing CSAT GPRA data strongly indicates that CSAT needs to take significant action to strengthen the availability of information on its discretionary grant portfolio so that it can be appropriately managed.  The purpose of this contract is to consolidate GPRA reporting and related activities for CSAT’s entire discretionary program under one umbrella; these are currently spread across multiple CSAT Technical Assistance and GPRA contracts.  This contract will provide GPRA coverage for all CSAT discretionary activities in the Division of Services Improvement as well as the Homeless and Co&#64979;occurring Branch in the Division of State and Community Assistance. 
While the GPRA initiative under the National Evaluation Data Services II (NEDS&#64979;II) and other contracts has provided minimal data for the reporting of results, the data currently provided is not sufficient for program and CSAT accountability.  

This contract for the Services Accountability Improvement System will provide funding to cover GPRA activities for all discretionary programs falling under the Targeted Capacity Expansion (TCE) and Best Practices program announcements, specifically for use in conducting accountability and performance assessments of these programs, making such information available to CSAT project officers for improved project oversight and CSAT management for improved staff and grantee portfolio oversight.  In addition, the contract will provide support for the delivery of training and technical assistance to grantees on the collection of GPRA data, serving as a data entry point for GPRA data collection as well as a data repository.
 The Services Accountability Improvement System will provide additional support for GPRA and CSAT accountability and management activities, separate from grantees’ programmatic funding, and will ensure a coordinated focus on GPRA, performance monitoring and accountability data, across all TCE and Best Practice programs.  It is expected that improved funding availability will lead to more, and better data on programs and potentially will contribute to standardization of key data elements across all CSAT programs.  Specifically, CSAT will have, at a minimum, the capacity to report for all CSAT programs on:  Particular populations served, numbers of people served, types and locations of particular activities supported, effectiveness across programs for particular populations, the characteristics and effectiveness across programs of activities relative to national, subpopulation and geographic area data and trends.  Better data will provide information to Division Chiefs, Branch Chiefs, Government Project Officers (GPOs) and grantees useful both for improving programs and making more informed funding decisions.

This is not a request for proposal and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.  Responses to this notice shall be mailed to Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Office of Program Services, Contract Management Branch, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockwall II Building, Suite 640, Rockville, MD 20852 Attn: Matt Johnson.  Telephone and/or e-mail responses will not be accepted. Responses must be received by in writing no later than March 29, 2003 by 3:00 pm, Eastern Standard Time.  

Responses to this sources sought announcement will not be considered adequate responses to the solicitation, a request to be added to a prospective bidders/offerors list or to received a copy of the solicitation.   All interested offerors will have to respond to the solicitation announcement in addition to responding to this sources announcement.  No solicitation is currently available.*****

<DESC>NA Description of Work:  The project work consists of dredging portions of Key West Harbor, including the Main Ship Channel, Cut-A, Cut-A Widener, Cut-B, Cut-C, Cut-C Turning Basin, and Truman Harbor.  The final dredging depths have not yet been determined; h owever, the deepest dredging scenario under consideration is a required depth of 37 feet with an allowable overdepth of 1 foot.  Under this scenario, the total amount of material to be dredged would be approximately 1.5 million cubic yards.  The general ty pes of material expected to be encountered are silt, sand, and rock.  Under the 37-foot plus 1-foot scenario, the expected proportion of rock could approach 40%.  Under shallower dredging depth scenarios, the expected proportion of rock would be less.  The  final disposal area details have not yet been determined.  In general, however, the disposal area will be located adjacent to the northern shore of Rockland Key.  Maximum distances from the dredging area to the disposal area will be on the order of 15 mil es.  An approved pipeline corridor (water route portion as well as overland portion) will be available to the contractor for placement of dredge pipe.  The contractor should expect that close coordination with environmental agencies will be required when p lacing pipeline within the approved corridor so that impacts to environmental resources can be avoided.  The placement of dredged material may involve the partial filling of deep (underwater) borrow pits.  It may also involve an upland site or sites provid ed for the purpose of dredged material disposal.  The contractor will be expected to include a method and design for upland containment on the provided site or sites(s) as part of his proposal for this project.  In general, the contractor should expect tha t a high degree of environmental sensitivity will be required of him by this contract.  This same level of sensitivity will be expected by the environmental community, which will be diligently watching the contractor’s operations, especially with regard to  turbidity.  In particular, the contractor should expect to work with restrictions such as areas of no access, areas where anchor placement is not allowed, and special requirements regarding the use of anchor cables, swing cables, mooring lines, etc. The latest hydrographic survey (including sub-bottom profile data and side scan sonar images) is available at the following web site:http://www.saj.usace.army.mil/conops/navigation/surveys/hydro.htm This Request for Information (RFI) is a market research to determine whether there is enough interest and market capabilities to go forward.  If there is sufficient interest, the Jacksonville District intends to advertise this work under a Request for Prop osal (RFP) in July with closing in August, 2003.  The RFP will be issued as an unrestricted procurement.  CONCERNING THIS RFI, DO NOT SUBMIT PROPRIETARY AND/OR BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL DATA, ONLY A STATEMENT OF YOUR INTEREST.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)/Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO-SCOTT) hereby issues the following Request For Information (RFI) regarding global video teleconferencing services.  
A.  PURPOSE: The Defense Information System Network (DISN) Video Service (DVS) Program Management Office seeks information for the provision of a global digital video rich-media conferencing service incorporating advanced technologies for the Department of Defense (DoD). The information gathered from this RFI will assist in the development of strategic alternatives for (a) future Request for Proposal(s).   
B.  INTENT: The RFI is intended to gather information about the availability of technology/products in the market that will fulfill anticipated requirements for video, audio, and web-based conferencing services and includes other value-added elements. Information submitted in response to this RFI will become the property of DISA. DISA will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this RFI. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. DISA will not pay for information provided, and is not liable for any costs incurred by the company in response to this RFI. Price quotes are not required, however, general cost estimates are appreciated to assist in planning. Cost estimates provided will not be binding for the company. 
C.	BACKGROUND: Video Teleconferencing (VTC) is considered a critical element of DoD Command and Control (C2). The use of video conferencing in day-to-day operations of the DoD includes Combatant Commands (COCOMs) execution of war plans and exercise plans, military training, simulation, and general unit command and operation. Regular system users include the National Command Authority and Military Service leaders. DISA is assigned responsibility for providing global video teleconferencing (VTC) capabilities for the Department of Defense (DoD) for command and control (C2). These services are separate from services for non-C2 functions. However, non-C2 VTC is integral to the DoD video service requirements and complementary to C2 VTC. The current video services contract includes video hub services to provide video, audio and data bridging, network bridging, speed matching, inter-hub bandwidth management, conference scheduling, conference set-up and control, security services including access controls, encryption and secure conferences, limited problem isolation, and other related services. The current contract does not include end-user equipment maintenance and support or customer conference room operations. Transmission and network bandwidth management is provided by other related contracts. A concept for an end-to-end conferencing service with multiple service level options is being considered. In such a system, DoD customers could choose a level of service needed to support their operational environment. Services may range from a multipoint conferencing hub service to a complete end-to-end service including customer site operations, customer site maintenance, and customer premise equipment. However, DISN networks and their follow-on architecture will be the fundamental transport infrastructure for DOD end-users.  Conferencing systems may include studio, fixed, desktop, mobile and deployable systems and related installation or maintenance services. Over the life of the service, periodic technology insertions would be expected to maintain standards-based services and to incorporate emerging video conferencing and related technologies.  
D. 	DESIRED INFORMATION: DISA desires information on industry capabilities to support the services and features listed below. This list is neither detailed nor all-inclusive, but is representative of the type of services DISA expects the defense video conferencing service to provide. DISA will consider responses to this request for information in defining system requirements and alternatives. DISA is aware that some customization may be required to meet specific C2 requirements.  FEATURES: Support for integrated video, audio, and web conferencing. Compliance with the latest Federal Telecommunications Recommendation for video teleconferencing including consideration for support of H.320,  H.323,  H.310, SIP and other related video standards. Compliance with industry standards for data conferencing including T.120 and related standards. Compliance with Defense Collaboration Tool Suite standards.  Support for conferencing among users on multiple network accesses including T1, ISDN, IP and ATM networks. Networks will include Defense Information Systems Network (DISN), Defense Switched Network (DSN), FTS2001, commercial ISDN, and may include Nonsecure IP Router Network (NIPRNET), Secure IP Router Network (SIPRNet), and DISN ATM (DATMS) .  Support for point-to-point and multi-point conferencing among diverse end points including support for interactive, teleseminar, and telebroadcast services, with full duplex audio and video using a variety of compression standards. Provide for secure and non-secure audio add-on to videoconferences.  Provide for one-way streaming of videoconferences.  Provide caching of video information for remote retrieval.  Support for all forms of video conferencing applications: teleconference, teletraining, telemedicine, tele-maintenance and similar applications. Provides a variety of conferencing equipment suites including configurations for studio, room, desktop, mobile, satellite and deployable environments and remote management of these. Provides installation and maintenance options for customer location equipment. Interface with Allied host nation networks and standards. Video and audio format and compression conversions and transcoding, continuous presence. Variable data rates and speed matching.  Features to enhance reliability and survivability to support C2. Support for classified conferences at different security levels including Unclassified, Sensitive But Unclassified, and Classified (up to and including Top Secret Collateral). Incorporate an automated interactive scheduling and reservation system with worldwide accessibility. Support for both on-demand and scheduled conferences. Integrated network management including fault isolation management.  Detailed requirements will be promulgated in (a) future RFP(s). DISA solicits information from industry about capabilities and services that can be supported as well as information about potentially qualified providers of these system capabilities. This information will assist DISA in alternatives definition and system planning and budgeting.

<DESC>The Department of State, International Programs Division, is seeking qualified laboratories that would be interested in securing Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) designation.  Once designation is obtained, the laboratory would work with the Department of State under the Chemical Weapons Convention, a global treaty that prohibits the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention, transfer and use of chemical weapons.  Interested laboratories should have, or have the potential to gain, the capabilities to analyze for chemicals listed in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) Schedules of Chemicals.  OPCW designation is obtained by passing three proficiency tests that require the successful analysis of a number of unknown chemical compounds.  The OPCW-administered tests are conducted approximately every six months.  A laboratory is required to pass one proficiency test per year to maintain OPCW designation. Interested laboratories would be responsible for all costs associated with the OPCW testing and designation.
Interested parties should send a letter of interest to James S. Rogers, US Department of 
State, PO Box 9115 Rosslyn Station, Arlington, VA  22219.  This letter must arrive at the above address no-later-than close of business May 7, 2003.  Any and all questions should be directed to Mr. Rogers at (703) 875-7320 or via email at RogersJS@state.gov.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Thomson Financial Publishing to effectively and efficiently verify depository accounts and to detect unreported depository accounts at financial institutions. This project will be accomplished two phases.  The initial phase (Proof of Concept (POC)) will have a period of performance of one year.  During the POC phase the Vendor will be expected to process verifications and reimbursement requests from a number of test offices in selected states. This will involve converting to electronic media the informational exchanges that now occur in paper form each year between financial institutions and SSA during the initial application period and the re-determination process.  In addition to requesting account balances and interest income revealed by the applicant/recipient/deemor, we will also request titling and balance information on all types of accounts or certificates held by the applicant/ recipient/deemor.  Upon successful completion of the POC SSA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Thomson Financial Publishing the "Fully Developed Phase" (FDP) of this project.  The  FDP will include system development to fully automate the account verification, reimbursement processes, with the ultimate goal to make the verification process totally transparent to the user so that the system automatically generates verification requests, records the response and then only generates alerts to the user for cases requiring further action.  The FDP will have a period of performance of base one year period and four one-year options. Thomson Financial Publishing is the only organization uniquely qualified to implement all the tasks required under this contract.  SSA knows of no other source that has the capability to satisfy all of the requirements for this contract.  This is a notice of intent and not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties that feel they can provide these services may respond by submitting their capability statement to Jackie Lessig by mail to: SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION, 1710 GWYNN OAK AVENUE, BALTIMORE, MARYLAND 21207; by email to jacqueline.lessig@ssa.gov or by fax to 410-965-9560. All responses shall be marked CAPABILITY STATEMENT- FINANCIAL INSTITUTION VERIFICATION,  and shall be received within ten (10) days of the publication date of this notice. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received by the cutoff date above, the SSA will proceed with sole source negotiations with Thomson Financial Publishing All questions must be submitted in writing to the mailing address or email address listed above and marked to the attention of Jackie Lessig. Telephone calls will not be accepted.

<SUBJECT>49 -- Automatic Diagnostic Engine Test System (ADETS), Market Research Results, and Industry Day/Risk Assessment Workshop Notification
<DESC>Automatic Diagnostic Engine Test System (ADETS), Market Research Results, and Industry Day/Risk Assessment Workshop Notification

A Sources Sought Synopsis regarding this requirement was posted to “FedBizOpps” on 08 Nov 02.  The notice contained a draft Requirements Correlation Matrix (RCM), a brief program summary and a Contractor Capability Survey; which allowed potential sources to provide their capability.  Based upon the Government’s evaluation of the results of the Market Research, the subject acquisition will be a set-aside 100% for small business pursuant to FAR 19.5 with applicable NAICS 336413, (1000 Employees).

The ADETS team is pleased to announce the dates for the subject workshop.  The purpose of the workshop is to evaluate the requirement for areas of risk, to obtain industry perspective, and to foster better understanding of the source selection process.  The workshop will commence on Monday, 19 May 03 and continue through Wednesday, 21 May 03, possibly extending to Thursday 22 May 03, where one-on-ones between Industry and the Government are desired.  It will begin at 8:00 a.m. and end at approximately 4:30 p.m. each day.  Although the workshop is scheduled for three days, it may conclude early.

The workshop will consist of two sessions, tentatively scheduled as follows.  Industry Day on Monday, will consist of an overall review of the program requirements and one-on-one meetings between Contractors and the Government.  The second session, Tuesday through Wednesday, will be the Risk Assessment Workshop.  Both sessions will be conducted in Building 376, Room 404, Robins Air Force Base in Warner Robins, Georgia.  Those desiring one-on-ones may return again on Thursday.

Due to space limitations at the facility, industry participation will be limited to only those parties who intend to submit a proposal to the Government to satisfy the requirement.  Industry teams shall be limited in size to a total of three people.  Team composition is at the discretion of the industry participant and may include subcontractors if you desire.  Each team should designate one member as the team’s spokesperson as discussions become necessary.  

The technical documents located at http://pkec.robins.af.mil/ will be the focus of the risk assessment workshop.  Because these documents are Export Controlled, only US contractors that are certified and registered with DLSC [(800)352-3572] and have a legitimate business purpose will be allowed access.  Contractors must submit a copy of their current and approved DD Form 2345 to the Contracting Officer to obtain a password to access the data package.  To facilitate the risk assessment process, all participants, industry and Government are expected to be familiar with these technical documents.  As part of your review of the technical documents, request you develop a listing of the requirements as you see them.  During your review, look for potential missing, incomplete, or ambiguous data, or anything else which you believe may render the requirement definition unclear or hard to understand.  Please develop and be prepared to share the results of your review and your list of the top 15 areas of risk identified by your company.  

The workshop will be conducted via anonymous computer input and will be facilitated by an independent third party.  Only one team member will be allowed at the computer terminal at a time and they are the only one allowed verbal input when discussions are necessary.  A general overview of the risk assessment workshop is as follows: orientation, Government Program Manager’s in-brief, Risk Assessment Briefing, Requirements Brainstorming, Risk Brainstorming, Risk Voting, Highest Rated Risks, disposition of highest rated risks into subject areas, notional source selection evaluation criteria.   A detailed agenda and additional instructions addressing the risk assessment process will be provided at the beginning of the risk assessment workshop.

Industry participation in this workshop is entirely voluntary.  The Government does not intend to pay for the information obtained during the workshop or for the time and expense of the industry participants involved.  Further, the Government requires unrestricted use of any information resulting from the workshop sessions.  The results of the risk assessments workshop will be posted to the web as soon as possible after the conclusion of the workshop.  The Government reserves the right to revise the products of the workshop to ensure all user requirements are satisfied.  Do not assume that a contract will result from this effort.  

Parties interested in attending the Industry Day or risk assessment workshop or scheduling a one-on-one appointment must apply in writing to the Contracting Officer.  Applications may be sent to the address provided, or via e-mail to louis.cornell@robins.af.mil, or faxed to (478) 926-6950; on or before 4:00 p.m. EST, 01 May 03.  E-mail is preferred.

<SUBJECT>10 -- OPEN ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE TO INDUSTRY ESTABLISHING SOFTWARE AND ELECTRONICS DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
<DESC>This Special Notice has been posted by Naval Sea Systems Command in support of the Open Architecture implementation efforts by IWS 7.0 (Open Architecture Project Office).  FedBizOps provides maximum dissemination of this important guidance that directly effects all future IWS software and electronics development programs.  Michael W. Masters at mastersmw@nswc.navy.mil  or (540) 653-6415 is the Chief Scientist for Advanced Programs and the POC for all technical issues regarding the attached guidance documents.  LCDR John H. Windom at windomjh@navsea.navy.mil is the PCO for this effort.  The following background information is provided:
  The Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition (ASN (RDA)) assigned the Program Executive Office for Integrated Warfare Systems (PEO IWS) with responsibility for coordinating the introduction of Open Architecture (OA) into the Navy's combat systems.  Computing technology is a key part of the OA effort.  Therefore, as part of the OA tasking, and based on significant research and testing, the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) has developed two supporting documents relevant to computing for OA.  Taken together, these documents describe the technical characteristics of and requirements for computing systems in support of OA-based combat systems.  This unified set of computing resources is called the Open Architecture Computing Environment (OACE).  These documents provide significant insight into OACE capabilities and requirements, but they are not yet fully mature.  They are currently under formal review across the naval community.
This document, Open Architecture Computing Environment Design Guidance, (Version 1.0), provides interim guidance concerning design aspects of the standards-based computing environment that is to be used in OA warfighting systems.   A companion document, Open Architecture Computing Environment Technologies and Standards, Version 1.0 (Interim), provides an enumeration of the standards and product selection criteria that apply to the OACE technology base.  The scope of OA is intended to encompass warfighting and combat systems for ships, submarines and aircraft - including their sensor systems, weapon systems, combat direction systems and other mission critical support systems.  Also included are selected C4ISR systems, the specifics of which are still under discussion.  Therefore this document is intended to provide overall guidance for the design and implementation of warfighting-capable software which, when coupled with OACE, will meet warfighting mission requirements for systems across the range of deployments listed above.
This interim release of OACE information constitutes guidance that is preliminary in nature, and it will be updated according to a formal process that is being documented separately.  This version of the document is being provided in order to solicit commentary from organizations outside PEO IWS.  Initial review indicates that the design guidance as written, has applicability in both the combat system domain as well as the command, control and communication domains.  Review of the document should include comment regarding the opportunity to provide a single guidance source for all of the aforementioned warfare domains. The guidance contained herein was made available at the beginning of the OA initiative, August 2002, for purposes of government and industry review.  The formal review process for the version 1.0 final is scheduled to be complete by June 2003.  An updated version of this document will be issued in July 2003 once that process is complete and the industry and government comments have been incorporated as appropriate.  The guidance will then be updated on a periodic basis by PEO IWS according to a formal process (currently being defined) that is closely aligned with changes in the commercial market.

<body>
<p><b>Request For Comment, ERA Draft Requirements Document</b></p>

<p>This is a Request For Comment (RFC). The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) seeks review comments from industry on the draft Requirements Document (RD) being developed for the Electronic Records Archives (ERA) program. Please be advised that this RD is a DRAFT at this time, and various changes may be included in the final RD once an RFP is issued. This initial release is intended to collect comments from industry to mature this RD for future inclusion in a Draft RFP.  </p>

<p>The ERA system will authentically preserve and provide access to any kind of electronic record, free from dependency on any specific hardware or software, enabling NARA to carry out its mission into the future. To do this, ideally the system would be able to take any type of record, from any entity in the Federal Government, created using any type of application, on any computing platform, and provide discovery and delivery to anyone with an interest and legal right of access, now and for the life of the republic. Detailed background information on the ERA program is available at the ERA web site, <a href="http://www.archives.gov/electronic_records_archives">http://www.archives.gov/electronic_records_archives</a></p>

<p>The current ERA business and contracting approach is full-and-open competition. NARA’s acquisition approach is initially to award multiple development contracts using a best value competition. Under the initial Analysis and Design phase of the development contract the selected contractors will each produce a detailed system requirements specification and high-level system design. At the end of this phase there will be a down-select to a single contractor that will develop the ERA. Up to five increments are anticipated for development of the ERA.  The development of each increment will be exercised as an option.</p>

<p>The Draft ERA RD may be downloaded from the ERA Acquisition web site at </p>
<p><a href="http://www.archives.gov/electronic_records_archives/about_era/documentation.html">http://www.archives.gov/electronic_records_archives/about_era/documentation</a> </p>

<p>Comments should address the RD by major functional area, and should map to the numbering within the RD. In addition, please comment on the RD with reference to the ERA acquisition strategy.  You are strongly encouraged to provide a reasoned opinion as to whether the RD now contains sufficient information to support a fixed price acquisition approach, along with the approach you recommend, if different. </p>
<p>In order for your response to receive full consideration, it should be received by May 14, 2003. Responses must be submitted electronically to the following email address: <a href="mailto:ERA.Acquisition@nara.gov">ERA.Acquisition@nara.gov</a> . Responses must be in Microsoft Word 97 or PDF format. No telephone calls will be accepted.</p>

<p>All comments received from potential offerors will be considered by the Government in updating the RD and for preparation of the Draft RFP. Specific responses to comments will not be posted on the ERA Acquisition web site. Any changes made will be at the sole discretion of the ERA Program Office. PROPOSALS ARE NOT REQUESTED AT THIS TIME AND WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred by interested parties for responses to this RFC.</p>

<SUBJECT>R -- PerfMan Software
<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intends to issue a sole-source award toThe Presidio Corporation for the renewal of maintenance for PerfMan software currently installed and operational at the Detroit Computing Center (DCC), the Martinsburg Computing Center (MCC), and the Tennessee Computing Center (TCC).  The maintenance renewal shall begin on May 1, 2003 and shall run through September 30, 2003.  PerfMan is a product of The Information Systems Manager, Inc. (ISM).  

The IRS requires renewal of an enterprise wide maintenance license, currently for 5025 MIPS capacity, for PerfMan software, an integrated product which focuses on performance management and capacity planning for the Tier I mainframe IBM compatible systems.  This planning and performance management is critical to tax processing operations in that it allows for adequate time to increase computing capacity to accommodate workload growth.  This product is installed and operational at DCC, MCC, and TCC. 

PerfMan is a tool used to analyze workload and capacity on the IRS’ Tier I mainframe computing systems.  The PerfMan product includes unique functionality required by the IRS including: 

(1)  The PerfMan software product’s performance databases reside on the IBM mainframe and are managed using the mainframe's powerful data management tools.  Selected data is downloaded from the mainframe and analyzed at the workstation.  This feature allows the downloading of data for discrete periods and analyzing the data at the workstation from a single viewpoint.  This allows the capacity planner to view system and workload data over an extended period of time without having all of the data reside on the workstation.  This functionality eliminates the re-building of the performance database when conducting "what if" modeling scenarios to model different changes in CPU, DASD, memory and workload configurations.  

(2)	 Another feature of the PerfMan product is the Automated Tape Library (ATL) and Virtual Tape Sub-system (VTS) which reports on usage and performance for these components.  As the Service continues to rely on tape processing, tape processing management is a critical component of the Service's Masterfile computer operations.  

(3)  The PerfMan Business Unit Analysis (BUA) component is an important tool used to perform analysis down to the granular work unit level.  The BUA component provided by PerfMan uses both SMF-type 30 records and SM- type 42 records to perform the combined analysis.  By using both types of metrics, it is possible to obtain a complete picture of application and workload performance.  
                                                             
(4)	The PerfMan product performs all reporting, capacity planning, and modeling functions on the workstation using a Graphical User Interface (GUI).  Other products require some functions to run on the mainframe and others to run on the workstation.  A single point of control and work increases productivity and facilitates communication.  

This is a sole source requirement to The Presidio Corporation.  Responsible vendors who believe they can provide a functionally equivalent product shall furnish a detailed proposal to include cost and price no later than April 30, 2003 to the Government Point of Contact listed herein.

<DESC>JOINT AIR/GROUND OPERATIONS: UNIFIED, ADAPTIVE REPLANNING (JAGUAR), SOL BAA 03-26, DUE:  05/30/03; POC:  DR. ROBERT R. TENNEY, DARPA/IXO; FAX (703) 522-7161.  BACKGROUND:  Current events in Iraq continue to demonstrate that the United States’ ability to maintain wartime initiatives depends critically on the ability to synchronize, flexibly and reliably, massive air operations.  The CENTCOM Air Operations Center (AOC) staff has been able to plan and conduct upwards of 2000 sorties per day, from dozens of bases, including search, strike, jamming, and tanker support, mixing both fixed and relocatable targets, with exquisite attention to hundreds of details for each mission.  However, this remarkable achievement is due almost entirely to the skills of hundreds of people, not to the quality of their automated support.  Several clear trends are converging that, without a great step forward in automation, may lead to prohibitive deployment, training, and logistical needs.  These includes more unmanned airborne platforms, increased multi-mission aircraft, more engagements per sortie, richer tactics, battlespace volatility, and the need for smaller staffs.  JAGUAR will unite technologies for plan generation, plan assessment, and model adaptation in a consistent, model-based framework that can respond to the forthcoming transformations in air operations.  This framework will be explicitly aligned with Air Force efforts to insert advanced technology into the AOC, to enable rapid transition.  OBJECTIVE:  Modern AOCs can be very large enterprises, with upwards of 800 staff on-site.  JAGUAR aspires to enable considerable (order-of-magnitude) reduction in staffing needed to perform battle management functions in an AOC by:  1) increasing the level of automation available in the future, while; 2) preserving the ability to sustain high sortie rates, under great time pressure, that faithfully respect all of the sources of complexity that affect air operations planning; and 3) allowing adaptation to new capabilities, tactics, and procedures as they are developed.  JAGUAR will leverage technologies developed under previous DARPA programs that significantly improve planning, control, and execution of military operations.  These include model-based methods, real-time symbolic planning, symbolic correlation, automated adaptation, and high-fidelity testbeds.  By achieving these objectives, the JAGUAR program will develop, demonstrate, and transition to the Air Force technology that will more-tightly couple AOC processes, in order to achieve the coordination and synchronization of air operations needed to enable the transformation in air operations.  PROGRAM STRUCTURE:  The JAGUAR program will design, demonstrate, and transition a closed-loop air battle management system consisting of three technology components: plan generation, plan monitoring, and model adaptation.  JAGUAR will evaluate components in an external, simulation-based testbed located at the Air Force’s Theater Aerospace Command and Control Simulation Facility (TACCSF).  The JAGUAR system will be exercised against this testbed in a series of carefully designed experiments to assess the coverage, error rate, latency, effectiveness, and workload of the system and its components.  These assessments will involve integration of the JAGUAR components, both with one another and with the testbed, along with experiment planning, execution, and analysis to objectively measure progress toward program goals.  The simulation testbed itself, along with relevant subject matter experts, will be provided by the Government. This BAA solicits proposals for each of the three technology components, for the integration of these components into a real-time, closed-loop system, and for the independent evaluation of this system within the TACCSF.  While this BAA outlines some of the minimal capabilities that such a system should possess, it is expected that a successful offeror will craft a solution that combines additional capabilities of the offeror’s choosing, with those described herein, to create a demonstrable system that provides a coherent, comprehensive realization of the JAGUAR objectives.  GENERAL APPROACH:  This solicitation requests ideas in five related areas:  three technical component development efforts, and two system-level design and assessment efforts.  Efforts in all five areas may assume the availability of: 1) the TACCSF for quarterly experiments; 2) support for integration of the JAGUAR system and evaluation instrumentation with the TACCSF simulators; and 3) subject matter experts who can provide detailed explanations of current AOC and air operations platforms, practices, procedures, and tactics.  JAGUAR will be conducted in three 18-month phases.  Phase I - Automation:  Develop the three technical components separately, coordinated through a design process established by the system designer, and assessed using a non-real-time analysis methodology established by the experiment designer.  Phase II - Integration:  Integrate the three technical components into a non-real-time JAGUAR system, capable of closed-loop interaction with the TACCSF, according to an architecture established by the system designer, and assessed concurrently by the experiment designer.  Phase III - Acceleration:  Increase the capability and speed of the JAGUAR system to permit real-time battle management of air operations from multiple sites, using a collaboration infrastructure provided by the system designer, and with real-time computation of performance metrics.  Each Phase will consist of three six-month spirals.  Each spiral will include two baseline events: 1) a Desert Pivot observation approximately two months into each spiral which allows JAGUAR team members to, on a non-interference basis, observe and analyze a Desert Pivot training exercise; and 2) a JAGUAR assessment occurring approximately the fifth month of each spiral, that will be conducted over a two week period at the TACCSF.  Assessments will include exercise of each of the technical components and the JAGUAR system on several distinct scenarios.  At the end of each spiral, the Experiment Design and Evaluation effort will deliver quantitative assessments of component and system level performance.  These assessments will provide the basis for continuation of the program at the end of each Phase.  AWARDS:  Up to two (2) awards are anticipated in each of three technical areas:  plan generation, plan monitoring, and model adaptation.  In addition, up to one (1) award is contemplated in two cross-cutting areas:  system design and integration, and experiment design and evaluation.  Non-critical path tasks that can be cleanly separated as individual modules should be proposed and costed as options.  The contract will be incrementally funded by fiscal year, assuming identified milestones have been satisfactorily met.  Funding in the out years is subject to satisfactory evaluation of the DARPA Go/No go criteria as well as availability of funds.  Contract Mechanisms:  Awards are anticipated to be in the form of Procurement Contracts or Other Transactions.  Grants or Cooperative Agreements are also possible.  SELECTION CRITERIA:  Proposals will be selected through a technical/scientific/business decision process with technical and scientific considerations being most important.  Evaluations will be performed using the following criteria list in descending order of relative importance:  (1) Relevance to JAGUAR Mission Objectives, (2) Consistency with JAGUAR Program Concepts, (3) Technical Innovation and Depth, (4) Personnel and Corporate Capabilities and Experience, and (5) Cost Realism and Value of Proposed Work to the Government.
