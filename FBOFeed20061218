<CONTACT>Natasha Rowland - Howie Contract Specialsit 4046794191 natasha_rowland-howie@fws.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) intend to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Design/Build (D/B) Construction, Multi-Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Southeast Region (Region 4). This is a competitive, best value, source selection that will be conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR Part 15.3).  In using this best value approach, the Government seeks to award to offerors who give the greatest confidence that they will best meet our requirements affordably. Projects are located at U.S. Fish and Wildlife Region 4 sites such as national fish hatcheries and national wildlife refuges in the southeastern United States.  The Southeast Region consists of the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. The MATOC will be for 5 years total consisting of a base year plus 4 one-year renewable options, and will result in award to multiple Design/Builders (D/B). The D/B will be requested to submit proposals on a rotational basis after consideration of individual task orders.   Extenuating circumstances such as familiarity with a site or specialized skills may dictate that a particular D/B be chosen out of order at the discretion of the Contracting Officer (CO).  There will be two (2) evaluation phases. Phase I (Short-list Criteria) and Phase II (Award Selection Criteria. Only applies to short-listed contractors). The sample Task Order referenced under "Award Selection Criteria (Phase Two)" is a real project and will be awarded as a task order to the short-listed D/B firm having the best design solution. The contract type will be firm fixed price, indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract with individual Task Orders.  Each Task Order will have a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP). Task Orders may vary in size but are expected to be issued for projects in the $100,000 to $4,000,000 range with most of the projects being below $3,000,000. Many of the project work sites are in remote locations where building materials and supplies are limited in quantity and variety.  Opportunities to use local labor may also be limited in quantity and specialty.  Site access can be difficult in these remote areas.  In Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, access is primarily by ship or air.  Project work consists of, but may not be limited to: projects primarily architectural in nature, projects primarily civil and infrastructure in nature and miscellaneous structures.  Projects primarily architectural in nature consists of buildings such as visitor centers, administrative office buildings, combination administrative office/visitor center buildings, equipment maintenance shop and storage buildings, crew quarters and bunkhouses, and single family dwellings.  These projects may have a civil works component such as roads, parking lots, water supply and sewerage systems, storm water management systems, utility systems, fences, and other appurtenant incidental structures. Projects primarily civil and infrastructure in nature consists of bridges, levees, concrete structures, water control structures, retaining walls, underground utilities, water and sewerage works, roads, parking lots, marine facilities, boardwalks, erosion control projects, and demolition/deconstruction projects.  These civil projects may have multi-disciplinary components including mechanical, electrical, plumbing, structural, geotechnical, hydrological, environmental, and architectural disciplines. Miscellaneous structures such as fences, kiosks, shelters, blinds, and interpretative elements. This is not a small business set aside in accordance with the latest quarterly adjustment under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. The North American Industry Classification System code (NAICS), size standard, and the estimated price range is to be specified on each individual task order.  A vendor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database (Mandatory for doing business with the government) in order to receive contracts, task orders, and payments from most Federal agencies, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. CCR is a self-service database. Vendors register themselves and maintain their own information through the CCR Web site.  In order to register or learn more about CCR, go to http://www.ccr.gov.  You will need to know your Dun and Bradstreet (D&B) number; however, if you do not have this number, you can contact D&B at (800)333-0505.  The tentative RFP issue date is on or about December 18, 2006 with a January 29, 2007 closing date. The RFQ documents will be available electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities website. The FWS is currently using Electronic Commerce to issue solicitations and the resulting award. The RFQ documents will be available at the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://www.fbo.gov under RFP Number 401816R058a. Paper copies WILL NOT be available. Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site for any updates or amendments. Questions should be directed by e-mail to Ms. Natasha Rowland-Howie, Contracting Specialist (natasha_ rowland-howie@fws.gov) or Mr. Lawrence (Mac) McCoy, Contract Specialist (lawrence_mccoy@fws.gov).

<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is one Operational Administration within the US Department of Transportation.  NHTSA is responsible for reducing the number of injuries and deaths occurring on the nation's highways.  As one approach to fulfilling this responsibility, NHTSA analyzes vehicle crashes in an attempt to determine what environmental, human, or mechanical factors may have contributed.  

The purpose of this procurement is to provide NHTSA with the capability to investigate, document and evaluate a variety of vehicle crashes on a short-notice basis.  These crash investigations typically involve school buses, child restraint systems, new or emerging technologies in automatic restraint equipped vehicles, alternative fuel vehicles, safety defects, adaptive control equipped vehicles, fires, crashes involving air bag deployment related fatalities and serious injuries and other special interest crashes as they arise.  Under this contract, the contractor shall be responsible for the timely gathering and documenting of data pertaining to these crashes.  The contractor shall also be responsible for the quality control of data submitted to NHTSAs Electronic Data System (EDS).

Specific objectives are as follows:

The contractor shall document pre-crash, at-crash and post crash circumstances and determine and describe the combination of vehicular, occupant, and environmental conditions associated with the identified crashes;

The contractor shall identify and report on all injuries resulting from the crash and associate each injury to the corresponding vehicle component or other object struck during the collision sequence;

The contractor shall determine and report on school bus crash configurations which produce injuries, the impact speeds involved, the positions of the children in the buses (seated, standing, etc.), and the crashworthiness of the buses involved;

The contractor shall examine and report on vehicles equipped with new or emerging technology in safety equipment to provide the NHTSA with information on the effectiveness of this rapidly changing technology, and; 

As needed, the contractor shall provide input on the effectiveness of the case vehicles performance to existing Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) and Highway Safety Program Standards (HSPS) and /or any safety related defect.

NHTSA anticipates awarding three (3) contracts for these services in order to support three (3) major geographic regions within the United States (Western, Central, and Eastern.)

<SUBJECT>D -- NATO Notification of Intent to Invite Bids for International Competitive Bidding on the Provision of NATO General Communication System Target Architecture - Development and Integration Support
<SOLNBR>IFB-12189-TA
<RESPDATE>012307

<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid for the provision of a Target Architecture (TA) 2007 - Development and Integration Support for the NATO General Communication System (NGCS). This project will provide the essential NGCS TA products (2007) to include development and integration support to define and support all NGCS-related projects from TBCE stage through source selection and ultimate implementation. It must adequately address the service management and integration with AIS projects. 

NC3A is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. NC3A intends to use the Best Value bidding procedure. The successful bid pursuant to this IFB will be that bid that is the best value for the money offered in accordance with the evaluation criteria: 50% Price, 40% Engineering, and 10% Management. 

NC3A plans to place a single contract with one contractor. No partial bidding will be allowed. 

Bidders will be required to declare a bid validity of 12 months from the closing date for receipt of bids, supported by a Bid Guarantee of Euro 30,000 ($39,300). Should the selection and award procedure exceed the 12th month after the bid closing date, firms will be requested to extend voluntarily the validity of their bids and bid guarantee. Bidders may decline to do so, withdraw their bid, and excuse themselves from the bidding process without penalty. 

The estimated value of this project is not available at this time. The reference of the Invitation for Bid (IFB) is IFB-12189-TA. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same IFB reference.

The IFB package will contain NATO UNCLASSIFIED material only. 

Please note that contractor personnel will be called on to work at a NATO site in conjunction with the contract and that such contractor personnel are required to have a security clearance at the level of NATO SECRET. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the Host Nation the NATO clearance certifications for all personnel assigned to the contract.

OPERATIONAL OBJECTIVE

The mix of communication network services provided by the NGCS, military National Defense Network (NDN), commercial bearer services providers and available Postal, Telephone and Telegraph (PTT) networks within NATO nations is sufficient to satisfy current connectivity requirements between NATO Command Structure Headquarters and In-Place/Reinforcement forces. This static communications network need to be enhanced and expanded, however, so as to provide static and deployed commands and their staff with the full range and response of communications services required to accomplish their assigned missions and to meet new and evolutionary requirements.

It is necessary to expand the NGCS in order to accommodate the growing information exchange requirements in support of political and military decision-making processes and the conduct of joint land, air, and maritime operations. The capability must support the timely exchange of large quantities of information in diverse formats (voice, data, image and video) amidst many geographically dispersed locations. Further, the NGCS will have to provide adequate interoperability, security, survivability, and resilience.

The architecture framework, set out in NATO C3 Systems Architecture Framework (NAF), states that Capability Packages (CPs) should be associated with one or more TA, which forms the basis of in-depth requirements validation and the system design processes. To conform to NAF, TA projects will also include a security assessment.

A TA for NGCS will ensure the required degree of interoperability between the systems and services delivered by the different projects that form core communication network services NATO-wide (CP 0A0104) and thereby minimize the implementation risk.

SCOPE OF WORK

This TA 2007 project will be developed in the framework of the NATO Static Communications Program known as NGCS.

The TA 2007 project will consist in the delivery of five (1 + 4TA) documents:

- NGCS Baseline Architecture 2007 (BA 2007)
- NGCS Target Architecture Framework 2007 (TAF 2007)
- Interface Control Document (ICD)
- Security Assessment (SA)
- Integration Test and Acceptance Plan (ITAP)

The TA 2007 development will address all major components of the NGCS:

- Service Level Management
- Transmission
- Switching
- Packet Transport
- Security

The TA 2007 will accurately describe how the NGCS will evolve and be fielded in 2009 for all its components.

This TA 2007 will give detailed information addressing the Road Map of NGCS implementation, defining the sequence of projects implementation and providing for all components the 2009 level of evolution /modification/integration for NGCS optimization and should not be perceived as a theoretical or scientific exercise.

It will not only give principals and guidelines for NGCS implementation but also numbered information to identify the delta between the baseline 2006 and the TA 2007 implementation for all components.

In order to be consistent and truly applicable to the NGCS, it will also address the risk elements of the entire NGCS implementation, i.e., re-analyze all projects risk table in accordance with TA proposals.

The TA 2007 will also analyze the life-cycle cost of the NGCS as implemented in 2009 in order to give to NATO the full visibility of Operation and Maintenance (O&M) needs, including manpower impact, against the current situation.

NC3A will deliver as Purchaser Furnished Equipment (PFE) a draft Baseline 2007 NGCS Architecture based on the RA and NGCS as implemented. This document will consist in:

- An initial NGCS baseline architecture
- An initial NGCS list of building blocks (elementary devices and services of all the NGCS components)
- An initial list of interface documents (will reference all interface-related documents of all building blocks

This initial NGCS Baseline Architecture 2007 initially produced by NC3A will then be refined, updated, and completed by the contractor. It will include a description of the building blocks that can be mapped between it and the identified projects in CP 0A0104 and that can be reused for the TA definition. The building blocks descriptions will contain sufficient technical detail to apportion system-wide capabilities and performance.

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid.

Any change to Team staffing or membership at this late stage would also affect relationships and progress affecting other programs such as ONR Intelligent Autonomy Programs and ONR EC Programs.  The cost to the Navy would be extensive if this were to occur.

<SUBJECT>F--Long Term Wild Horse Holding Facility(ies) Located West of the Mississippi
<SOLNBR>NAR070052
<RESPDATE>020807
<ARCHDATE>12182007
<CONTACT>Steven Santoro Contracting Officer 3032363518     Steven_Santoro@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a requirement for one or more pasture facilities to maintain from 750 to 1,500 wild horses each for one year, with 4 additional one year option periods. The facilities must be located west of the Mississippi River. The following sets forth the background of BLM's needs and the basic requirements needed for each Wild Horse & Burro Holding Facility: Wild horses on public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and U.S. Forest Service are protected, managed and controlled under the provisions of the Wild and Free Roaming Wild Horses and Burro Act of December 15, 1971, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1331 1340).  As resource conditions and other factors warrant, excess wild horses are removed from the public lands and placed in private maintenance through the Adopt A Horse Program.  Horses that have not been adopted because of age or other factors are being cared for on private land.   The purpose of this solicitation is to obtain one or more facilities (located west of the Mississippi River), each to pasture 750 to 1,500 wild horses. The intent is to provide a pasture setting for these animals while they are cared for on private land.  During the first years of this contract the majority of the horses may be younger, adoptable animals that will be shipped and received on a year-round basis.  It is the intent of the BLM that the number of animals at the facility will decline during the period of this contract. On  December 8, 2004 Public Law 108-341; Section 142 amended the 1971 Wild and Free-roaming Horses and Burros Act (Public Law 92-195) that requires the BLM to sell excess wild horses and burros which meet the following criteria: Animals that are 11 years of age and older; or Animals that have been offered unsuccessfully at three adoptions. This will require the BLM to remove animals that meet the above criteria from the contracted facility during the course of the contract.  All animals that are in too poor of health to be prepared or transported will be released back to the pastures or humanely destroyed to avoid undo suffering.  All wild horses that do not meet the above criteria will remain in a free-roaming environment.  Based on this Request for Proposal (RFP) the Bureau of Land Management anticipates the award of one or more contracts, each contract having the capacity to maintain 750 to 1,500 wild horses for long term wild horse holding facilities located west of the Mississippi.  Each contract shall be for one (1) base year, plus four (4) option years. The facilities must be prepared for the conduct of an Environmental Assessment (EA) and an inspection for specification compliance, to be performed by the BLM upon contract award.  Once a facility meets the minimum requirements of the EA and the specifications contained herein, BLM will begin shipping animals to the facility.  This is anticipated to occur within 90 calendar days from the date of award.  No payments shall be made until after animals are received at the facilities and have resided at the facility for a full one month period.  Contractor will be reimbursed on a per animal feed day basis for the previous month of service.  No advance payments are authorized. Award of a contract(s) constitutes the first and only delivery order of the contract.  Subsequently, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will schedule the delivery and pickup of animals with the Contractor. The objectives of this contract are: To maintain the excess wild horses in pastures 	large enough to allow free roaming behavior and that can provide the food, water and shelter necessary to sustain the animals in good condition; To gather and prepare all horses in a humane manner that falls under the criterion of saleable or adoptable animals.    To minimize the handling of wild horses by humans and sorting of the animals through chutes, gates and corrals; To provide regular, on the ground monitoring of the wild horses to ascertain their well-being and safety; Provide management by individuals who are knowledgeable and experienced about the behavior and nutritional requirements of equines and the management of land for the sustained production of grass and other desirable forage plants. The contractor shall provide all necessary land, facilities, personnel and supplies to perform the following general tasks.  Specific requirements for each are set forth in the subsequent paragraphs of the Description/Specifications/Work Statement. Provide land, forage, shelter, salt, minerals, water and fences necessary to properly care for and maintain 750 to 1,500 (based on the contractors proposals) wild horses  grazing in pastures.  The pastures shall contain sufficient standing forage (12 animal unit months of forage per animal) to provide for most of the nutritional requirements of the animals on a yearlong basis.  The contractor must also provide supplemental feed as necessary to maintain the horses in good condition (i.e. during periods of drought, deep snow, ice storms, fire, during times when the forage is depleted of protein content or when other circumstances warrant).  Supplemental feeding is not intended to provide the entire forage intake for extended periods while in pastures and shall not be included in carrying capacity determinations. Provide corrals and adequate facilities to load and unload wild horses on an as needed basis. Unload, sort and segregate animals upon their arrival, in the event that additional horses are transported to the facility. Gather and move horses from pasture to pasture as needed, supervise their health and welfare, provide supplementary feed as needed and maintain the facilities in a safe condition. Gather and hold in isolation horses that fall under the criterion of adoptable or saleable wild horses for a minimum of 30 days, until time for shipment.  Provide corrals, chutes, and adequate facilities to vaccinate and draw blood samples for horses prior to shipment.   Provide weekly monitoring of the animals to assess their health and determine death loss.  Prior to submission of the monthly invoice the contractor will conduct a complete inventory of all wild horses. The results of the each inventory will be included in the monthly invoice.   Maintain a record keeping system that documents the frequency and results of these observations. Provide a record keeping system that identifies the location of each horse on site and other information, such as its overall condition, death, etc. Each death will be recorded by the freeze mark and or description of the animal.  Date the animal was noted as dead and then submitted on each months invoice.  The records shall be made available for duplication within 5 days after a request is made by the COR and/or PI. Dispose of the remains of dead horses.  The contractor may be required, after consultation with the COR and/or PI or a designated representative, to euthanize horses that are suffering or are in pain. Handling and Gathering In the event that animals are transported to the facility, they will normally arrive at the site in trailer loads of approximately 35-40 head per load.  The contractor will provide a telephone number where they can be reached 24 hours per day for scheduling shipments.  BLM will attempt to schedule shipments for daytime arrival.  However, horses shall be unloaded immediately, regardless of arrival time.  The contractor will unload, sort by age, and condition, if determined to be appropriate by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and/or the Project Inspector (PI), into various groups. All horses shall be handled, treated and maintained in a humane manner.  Horses in corrals and 	chutes shall be worked in a manner that minimizes excitement of the horses to prevent injuries from crowding or trampling. Gathering or movement of horses from pastures shall be done with the concurrence of the COR and/or PI, except in emergency conditions, when the contractor determines an immediate gather or movement is necessary for the safety and welfare of the horses.  The contractor shall notify the COR and/or PI within 24 hours after such movement.  Handling of the horses will be kept to a minimum. However, it may be necessary to move the horses from one pasture to another because of range management practices. Gathering for the purpose of removing animals will be conducted when it is deemed necessary by the COR/PI.  The gather time will be determined by the COR and/or PI.  A BLM designated representative will be on site during the gather. The gather will be conducted in a humane manner.  Horses will be maintained separate in a corral area or small holding pasture for a minimum of 30 days, until notified by the COR and/or PI for shipment. Contractor will provide sufficient labor and facility to move and sort horses during holding prior to shipment.  The contractor will be notified by the COR and/or PI one week prior to gathering of the animals.  The COR and/or PI will notify the contractor of the number of animals that need to be gathered, prepared and shipped.  Corral / holding Facility Corrals may be permanent or temporary (portable panels). It is anticipated that the corrals will be used to receive, hold, gather, ship and prepare horses.  The corrals must be at least 72" high and made of stoutly constructed material i.e. pipe, steel, lumber, etc.  No barbed wire will be allowed in the construction of corrals and any corral constructed of mesh wire (openings no larger than 2 by 4 inches) must be equipped with at least 3 wood sight boards (2 by 8 inches) located on the upper portion of the fence.  The three sight boards shall be spaced no more than 12 inches apart.  Corrals constructed of pipe or wood must have openings of not more than 12 inches between horizontal members.  Corrals and holding areas need to be free of protrusions, and hazards.  Corral gates shall be constructed of wood or pipe the same height as the fences.  Gates shall be visible to the horses either from the materials used in construction or by using materials such as plywood or plastic mesh placed on the gates.  The contractor will furnish a concrete pad and electricity for a hydraulic chute and the Bureau will furnish the hydraulic squeeze chute.  Two sorting corrals, each with a minimum of 2,500 square feet. Separate corrals at the facility shall be available for confining lame or sick animals needing special care.  Soil types in corrals/pens must be well drained and non-alkaline in nature.  Slopes within the pens shall provide for adequate drainage.  In addition to other corrals the facility must have two larger corrals each with a minimum of 5,000 square feet to be used as holding corrals.   Small pastures to maintain approximately 150 wild horses prior to shipment. These pastures need to be accessible to the working corral, and constructed to have fencing to hold foals if needed during the weaning process. This would be small wire mess that would be low to the ground to prevent a foal from going under the fencing.   The small pastures, described under (5) above, must have sufficient water for 150 wild horses at a rate of 16 gallons per animal, per day. Adequate chutes, crowding alleys, to facilitate gathering, preparing, and shipping animals. The runway must have solid sides, have at least three sliding gates, be solidly constructed of steel or lumber, be at least 36' in length, 28-32" wide, and at least 72"tall. Unloading and Working Facility The facility shall have a loading and unloading chute, sufficient to safely unload and load semi trailer trucks and small stock trailers.  The chute may either be permanent or temporary.  In order to load horses at the site, a crowding pen and runway at least 36 feet long and 28 inches to 32 inches wide will be required.  Fences shall be a minimum of 72 inches high, stoutly constructed and made of lumber, pipe, or steel. Chutes shall have solid sides which restrict the animal's vision and will minimize the risk that the animal will attempt to jump out of the chute.  Width of the chute must be at least 32 inches.  In order to load horses at the site, a crowding pen and runway at least 36 feet long and a width of 28 inches to 32 inches wide, with at least three slide gates will be required.  A catwalk is required for at least one side of the chute and the runway.  Fences shall be at a minimum of 72 inches high, stoutly constructed and made of lumber, pipe, or steel. Fences Pasture perimeter fences shall be a minimum of 52" in height.  Pasture division fences shall be a minimum of 48" in height.  All pasture fences shall consist of four strands of barbed wire or other acceptable fencing materials.  If determined by the COR and/or PI, it may be necessary for the contractor to flag certain fences with eight (8) inches of flagging attached to the top horizontal member of the fence every 20 feet to make the fences more visible to the horses. Gates, rather than cattle guards, shall be used at all fence openings to keep horses in pastures.  Pastures The facility shall have sufficient land and forage to sustain a 750 to 1,500 (dependent on the contractors' proposal) wild horses year round. The land must be privately owned and cannot be located on public lands.  If any public lands are within the privately owned land, the public lands must be fenced out and will not be used in the calculation of the stocking rate.  The private lands must be at least 10 miles from any BLM Herd Management Area, Herd Area and/or Forest Service Wild Horse and Burro Territory.  Pastures shall be of sufficient size to allow horses freedom of movement and exercise necessary for good health and to continue their free roaming behavior.  Pastures shall be free of hazards such as unfenced paved public highways.  If pastures are noncontiguous, they shall be managed as separate units, each with a corral facility, with the maximum number of units being four (4).  Horses shall not be moved from one unit to another except under extraordinary conditions and with the permission of the COR and/or PI.  The maximum allowable driving distance between all units combined shall be no greater than fifty (50) miles. Sufficient land and forage shall be made available for the number of horses maintained.  However, as the herd is reduced by mortality or removal, pastures may be converted to domestic livestock use by the contractor, provided the use does not interfere with the wild horses.  Stocking domestic horses adjacent to or with the wild horses is unacceptable. The available standing vegetation in pastures must be of sufficient nutritive quality and quantity to maintain the horses in good condition yearlong, with supplemental feeding as described in paragraph f, below.  Good condition is described as follows: ribs cannot be visually distinguished, but can be easily felt; backbone is not visible; hip bones do not show; withers are distinguishable but do not protrude; shoulders and neck blend smoothly into the body.   The stocking rate for the site shall be adjusted as necessary to assure horses are maintained in good condition, as described above. Shelter from the natural elements shall be provided in each pasture by the topography (e.g., canyons, hills, etc.), other natural features such as trees, or manmade structures. Supplemental Feed Supplemental feed (primarily hay) shall be available at the site to feed the horses when natural forage nutritional value is low.  Supplemental feed shall be of such quality and fed in sufficient quantity to sustain the horses in good condition.  Supplemental feed shall not be fed to individual horses in declining health because of age and other natural causes.  Hay used as supplemental feed shall have a protein content of no less than 12%, be leafy, green, well cured, properly stored and free of dust, and mold.  Feed will be required daily for animals maintained in the corral areas, and supplemental feed will be required for pastured animals only during times when natural forage will not maintain the animals in good condition.  For example this could be during the winter months when the forage nutritional value is low. Horses maintained in corrals shall be fed hay in sufficient quantity to sustain the horses in good condition.   Hay used shall have a protein content of 12%, be leafy, green, well cured, and free of dust, mold and weeds or grasses deemed unhealthy forage for wild horses.  Feed shall be provided to the animals in cribs of appropriate size for the number of animals in the pen.  Feed Requirements A good quality, grass/legume hay shall be fed to and made available in sufficient quantity for each animal, with a crude protein not less than 12 percent.  Animals shall be fed at least 2.5 percent of body weight per day.  The COR may test hay to verify quality.  Inclement weather will stress animals, requiring that the volume of feed be increased to maintain their body flesh. Water, Minerals, and Salt Each pasture shall have reliable water sources capable of supplying 16 gallons of clean water per horse, per day.  The maximum distance to water in any pasture shall be 4 miles. Granulated, rock, or block salt shall be accessible to all horses in each pasture. Minerals necessary to maintain the horses in good condition and that are deficient in the available forage in the care unit shall be provided to all horses in each pasture, either as a supplement or added to the salt. Deaths and Disposal of Remains Dead horses shall be identified by freeze number and physical description, and disposed of in accordance with State and/or local sanitation laws.  Rendering plants may be used for carcass disposal provided no compensation is received by any agency or individual disposing of the remains.  The contractor shall notify the COR and/or PI, or designated representative immediately if the death of a horse is suspicious and it appears that a postmortem examination should be performed by a veterinarian.  The COR and/or PI shall hire a veterinarian and make the arrangements for this procedure. Observation of Horses The wild horses shall be observed by the contractor at a minimum of one (1) time per week, to determine the overall condition of the animals, and any deaths.  Observation will be conducted  more frequently when conditions warrant, i.e., during flooding, tornados, and the fire seasons, to ascertain their safety and well being and assure that fences are properly maintained.  Except in emergency situations, observations shall be carried out on foot, from a vehicle, or horseback.  In unusual situations, such as deep snow, etc., which make ground transportation impractical, aircraft may be used, with the prior approval of the COR and/or PI.  Prior to submission of the monthly invoice the contractor will conduct a complete inventory of all wild horses. Records that document, as a minimum, the date of the observation, number and condition of the horses, problems and concerns of the observer, and the name(s) of individual(s) making the observation shall be maintained.  Any problems or concerns shall be reported to the COR and/or PI within 24 hours of discovery. Access to the Facility Access to the unloading and loading chute shall accommodate both sedans with trailers and semi- trucks. Access shall be available during inclement weather. Observation for the Public The site is not intended to be a public viewing area.  Therefore, the contractor will restrict or prohibit access onto the site by the general public. The contractor shall notify the COR and/or PI within 24 hours of any request from human organizations, general public, media or wild horse interest groups, to observe the horses.  All such organizations and groups may be allowed to tour the site only under the approval and guidance of the COR and/or PI. All requests to view the animals shall be directed to the COR and/or PI. Records  An inventory that identifies all horses delivered to the site shall be kept at the facility.  A record shall be kept on the location (pasture) each horse occupies.  Each horse may be identified with a 4 digit freeze number on the hip, along with an angle freeze mark on the left side of the neck.  Horses that die shall be identified as soon as possible and noted on the monthly inventory.  Probable cause of death shall also be noted. Upon request by the COR and/or PI, the record shall be made available within 5 days for duplicating. Veterinary Care The BLM will provide and pay for a veterinarian to treat sick or injured horses, as deemed necessary by the COR and/or PI.  The veterinarian may be used to perform euthanasia on horses and conduct postmortem examinations as requested by the COR and/or PI.  The contractor shall gather and hold such animals and assist the veterinarian if necessary.  All vaccinations and preparation for shipment of horses will be conducted by the BLM with assistance from  the contractor. Farrier Services The COR and/or PI will determine if horses should have their feet trimmed.  BLM will make the arrangements and hire a farrier if trimming is needed.  The contractor shall gather the horses needing trimming and assist the farrier. This is not intended to be a complete list of the specifications. The full requirement will be posted in solicitation NAR070052, which will be available at http://www.fbo.gov on or about January 8, 2006. This requirement is 100% set aside for small businesses under NAICS 115210. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided. Facsimile proposals will not be accepted. Vendors must be registered at http://www.ccr.gov to be considered for award.

In particular, Section staff work on projects in which different optical techniques (e.g. thermal imaging, Doppler effect, diffuse optical imaging etc.) are used to study and monitor physiological status of tissues in vivo, looking for specific features, characteristic for some diseases (e.g., oral and skin cancer). A large? portion of our? research efforts have been devoted to developing methodology to quantify optical parameters of tissues and, thus, enhance capabilities of optical imaging as a useful clinical modality. One of the promising areas of investigation is application of polarized light to elucidate tissue structure and its variation due to progressing disease (e.g., cancer). The advancement of these, methods in a clinical setting would greatly benefit from the development of polarized videoreflectometry methods for noninvasive characterization of tissues and tissue-like materials.  To support these projects we have a need for professional assistance by a specialist who has an extensive expertise in areas of interaction of laser Light with biological tissues and measurements of the optical properties of tissues. Several new experimental design schemes and methodologies are in the process of being developed for which expertise in light polarization analysis and noninvasive optical monitoring of tissues in vivo are essential. The following project is representative of the work that is required: 1) Improve designed endoscopic system for polarization degree patterning and evaluate its performance for analysis of the epithelial tissues, in particular, early detection of their abnormalities;  2) Develop experimental setup, providing simultaneous measurement of cross- and co-polarized intensity distributions from tissue layers, illuminated with the linearly polarized beam that can be used in the clinical setting for investigation of skin fibrosis; 3) Develop methods of correlation analysis, using polarization data, to enhance visibility of hidden subsurface structures in tissues, e.g., to characterize the state of human teeth ex vivo; 4) Analyze application of multi-spectral imaging of human skin in vivo to quantification of blood oxygenation. Dr. Sviridov is uniquely qualified to satisfy the requirements of the contract. He possesses a Ph.D. in physics and has a deep knowledge of the subject, and has been devoting most of his professional life, using various optical methods with great success. Some of these problems are similar to the ones we are facing. Collaboration between our Section (LIMB/SBSP) and Dr. Sviridov (Institute for Laser and Information Technologies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia) has already brought important advances in the field of biomedical optics (preliminary results of the joint project were reported at several international conferences, two papers were published in 2005, the third paper is in press now. We are certain that continuation of our collaboration with Dr. Sviridov will be successful. Dr. Sviridov is an outstanding physicist and innovator, focused on applications of biomedical optics for tissue characterization and medical diagnostics. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however, all responses received, before the closing date, of this announcement will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government.

2.  demonstrates that the Offeror and its design team have either individually or collectively been successful in accomplishing the design (preferably design-build) of projects of a similar scope, complexity and dollar value as the project for which prequalification is requested; 

3.  demonstrates that the D/B team will have sufficient capacity, including sufficient financial, professional, personnel, and facility resources, to accomplish the project(s). 

FACTOR 3: PAST AND PRESENT PERFORMANCE

Offeror shall submit detailed information concerning Federal, State, and Local Government, and private contracts that demonstrate ability to perform D/B projects similar to those for which prequalification is requested.  Performance shall have been within the last three years.  These contracts may have been executed by other divisions, corporate management, or critical subcontractors, if such resources will be brought to bear or significantly influence the performance of the proposed effort. 

	Information for each contract shall include Offeror?s company/division; project name; customer contact and agency/company; contract number; brief description of effort and relevance to the proposed effort; type, value and performance period of contract; Offeror?s role in the work (prime or sub); name, address and telephone number of current or last Program Project Manager, Contracting Officer, and/or Contract Manager.  Offeror may include additional relevant information demonstrating significant achievements or explain performance problems it considers relevant to the proposed efforts. 

	DOS will evaluate whether the Offeror?s past performance for other customers and its past performance for DOS demonstrate conformance to specifications and compliance with contract terms and conditions, including subcontracting plan goals for small disadvantaged businesses; adherence to contract schedules; effectiveness in forecasting, managing, and controlling contract costs; conformance to construction safety plans; adherence to security requirements; responsiveness and business-like concern for the customer; and effective management of subcontractors and key personnel, including timely award of subcontracts and selection, retention, and replacement (when necessary) of key personnel. 

As prescribed in the Federal Acquisition Regulation at 15.305(a)(2)(iv), an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will receive a neutral rating.  Offerors that meet the other requirements described in this notice are invited to submit a statement of the Offeror?s business structure (e.g., Joint Venture, integrated contractor), and design and construction portfolios that illustrate the D/B contractor?s capabilities.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Paulette Wilson, (757) 878-2788
<DESC>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) is soliciting technical and cost proposals for conduct of 6.3 Research & Development as described below.  Proposals are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein.  T his Broad Agency Announcement constitutes the total solicitation.  There will be no formal Request for Proposals (RFP) or other solicitation requests for this requirement other than this announcement.  INTRODUCTION: The intent of the Advanced Affordable Turbine Engine (AATE) program is to take advantage of recent component efforts under DoD/NASA/DOE Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engine (VAATE) Program and other recent advanced technology efforts to advance the  state-of-the-art of turbine engines. Accordingly, the objective of this announcement is the development of a 3000 shaft horsepower engine to demonstrate advanced gas turbine technology capable of meeting / exceeding program goals and requirements, while p roviding excellent reliability, maintainability, durability, ballistic tolerance, and producibility characteristics, for potential application to multiple military and commercial vehicles.  Moreover, the AATE program will provide a validated engine technol ogy base from which future Army rotorcraft engine engineering development efforts may evolve at minimum risk, time, and development cost.  The overall goals of the AATE program include a 25% reduction in Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC), a 65% improvement in Shaft Horsepower to Weight (shp/wt), a 20% improvement in design life, a 35% reduction in production and maintenance cost, and a 15% redu ction in development cost. These goals, defined in detail below, are relative to year 2000 fielded systems. The AATE program will emphasize the development of innovative component technologies and / or cycle configurations to address overall and part power  performance.  Improved part-power fuel consumption characteristics are needed to meet the emerging endurance and cruise requirements associated with future Army aviation platforms.   Increased range and endurance drive the need for efficient propulsion ca pability over a wide operating envelope. The AATE development will also address the need to minimize overall vehicle operation and support costs.  The improved fuel consumption, durability, reliability and maintainability characteristics and the emphasis on lower production and maintenance costs for the gas turbine engine approach will result in significantly reduced O&S costs. The AATE program will be an integral part of the DoD/NASA/DOE VAATE program.  Although a Government approved Advanced Turbo Propulsion Plan (ATPP) will eventually be required for any successful offeror(s), such a plan is not required in order to be eligibl e for an award under this solicitation.  The AATE 3000 horsepower demonstrator engine program is anticipated for award in the 1st quarter FY08. TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The AATE program shall consist of design, fabrication, and component / engine demonstration testing aimed at achieving the program goals (stated in detail below) for the Armys Future Force fleet of rotorcraft. Engine demonstration testing shall include pe rformance and durability testing (note:  slave and / or non-production hardware permitted for engine testing).

<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is one Operational Administration within the US Department of Transportation.  NHTSA is responsible for reducing the number of injuries and deaths occurring on the nation's highways.  As one approach to fulfilling this responsibility, NHTSA analyzes vehicle crashes in an attempt to determine what environmental, human, or mechanical factors may have contributed.  

The purpose of this procurement is to provide NHTSA with the capability to investigate, document and evaluate a variety of vehicle crashes on a short-notice basis.  These crash investigations typically involve school buses, child restraint systems, new or emerging technologies in automatic restraint equipped vehicles, alternative fuel vehicles, safety defects, adaptive control equipped vehicles, fires, crashes involving air bag deployment related fatalities and serious injuries and other special interest crashes as they arise.  Under this contract, the contractor shall be responsible for the timely gathering and documenting of data pertaining to these crashes.  The contractor shall also be responsible for the quality control of data submitted to NHTSAs Electronic Data System (EDS).

Specific objectives are as follows:

The contractor shall document pre-crash, at-crash and post crash circumstances and determine and describe the combination of vehicular, occupant, and environmental conditions associated with the identified crashes;

The contractor shall identify and report on all injuries resulting from the crash and associate each injury to the corresponding vehicle component or other object struck during the collision sequence;

The contractor shall determine and report on school bus crash configurations which produce injuries, the impact speeds involved, the positions of the children in the buses (seated, standing, etc.), and the crashworthiness of the buses involved;

The contractor shall examine and report on vehicles equipped with new or emerging technology in safety equipment to provide the NHTSA with information on the effectiveness of this rapidly changing technology, and; 

As needed, the contractor shall provide input on the effectiveness of the case vehicles performance to existing Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) and Highway Safety Program Standards (HSPS) and /or any safety related defect.

NHTSA anticipates awarding three (3) contracts for these services in order to support three (3) major geographic regions within the United States (Western, Central, and Eastern.) Current plans state that no one contractor will receive award of more than one contract and that contracts will last at least three (3) years with options to increase the term by an additional two (2) years in one (1) year increments.  Any questions regarding this announcement, and its corresponding Request for Proposal must be submitted to the Primary Point of Contact, S. Peter Shultz at Pete.Shultz@dot.gov by no later than 10 August 2006.

C)  Seller is providing these products via Hewlett Packard authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales.  D) Full Hewlett Packard warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components.<BR><BR>This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of HP printers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST has identified the HP 1200d Printer as a key component to produce emergency photo-digitized passports at overseas Posts.  The HP1200d was selected for this purpose because results obtained by Creative Information Technology, Inc. in tests of commercial, non-custom ink jet printers indicated that it most closely met the Department of States requirements.   The 1200d uses some color in producing a grayscale printout.  Other manufacturers printers solely use black ink for this printing option.  The introduction of color in the generation of grayscale images significantly improves their quality and enhances overall document security since illicit duplication and image substitution is more difficult.  In addition, other manufacturers were found to use an ink formula that appeared to degrade output resolution and print quality, thereby lessening the security of these travel documents.  Lastly, a key issue in choosing the HP1200d was its proven ability to reliably feed the special stock used in the generation of emergency passport books.  Other printers experienced a higher rate of paper jams and stock spoilage because they were unable to handle paper of the weight and substrate finish used by the DoS. It should be noted that the only other printer that was judged to meet the Departments specifications was the Ricoh G700, which cannot be procured or fielded because it is not BAA/TAA compliant.  In summation, the continued use of the HP 1200d printer, rather than the introduction of another manufacturers product at this stage in the programs life cycle, is deemed to be the most cost effective course of action.  No other BAA/TAA compliant printer fully meets the Departments requirements.  The continued use of one make and model printer, the 1200D, eliminates the need to purchase, maintain and account for inventories of spare parts, cables, cleaning kits, ink cartridges and other accessories for multiple printer types.  Moreover, the selection of the 1200d obviates the need to train end users in the use and maintenance of multiple printers.    The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. The HP 1200D Printer has undergone test and assessment, evaluation for overseas deployments and received final approval from the Department of State Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board<BR><BR>

Title:  Office on Disability Program Coordination and Technical Management.

Contracting Office Address
Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management, Parklawn Building Room 5-101, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD, 20857

Description:

The Department of health and Human Services, Office on Disablity through the Program Support Center has a requirement for a contractor to provide  technical and program management services for two national initiatives as well as for program coordination between the Office on Disability (OD), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and government agencies and not-for-profit organizations, evaluation design, program analysis, report writing, and speech writing.  A description of these initiatives and associated functions follows:  

National Initiative 1:  Evaluating the Physical Fitness Initiative for Children and Youth with Disabilities

The HHS Office on Disabilities oversees the coordination, development, and implementation of programs and special initiatives within HHS that impact people with disabilities.  One of the special initiatives addresses health needs; it seeks to increase physical fitness in children and youth with disabilities.   This is an extension of the Department?s campaign against obesity through increased physical activity and good nutritional practices.  It is in concert with the Secretary and Surgeon General?s campaign on improving the health of American children through increased physical activity and good nutrition and responds to the health promotion objectives in Chapter Six of Health People 2010.  The long-range purpose is to reduce morbidity and mortality and to improve the quality of life of people with disabilities.  
Collaborating disability-based national organizations across the country will link physically fit mentors (who may or may not have a disability) with children who are disabled. The mentors will provide training and guidance to help the children become physically active by accumulating minutes of physical activity daily to earn the Presidential Active Lifestyle Award (PALA), and, with continued encouragement, strive to earn a Presidential Champions Award by accumulating points for a bronze, silver or gold medal.  The mentors will also provide the children with nutritional information and encouragement.
National Initiative 2:  Staff HHS? New Freedom Initiative Caregiver Subcommittee
In 2001, President Bush announced the New Freedom Initiative as part of a nationwide effort to remove barriers to community living for people with disabilities. Today, a full 20 percent of the U.S. population?more than 54 million Americans--are living with a disability.  Almost half of these individuals have a severe disability affecting their ability to see, hear, walk or perform other basic functions of life. In addition, there are more than 25 million family caregivers and millions more who provide aid and assistance to people with disabilities. 
The New Freedom Initiative is a comprehensive plan to ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to learn and develop skills, engage in productive work, make choices about their daily lives and participate fully in community life. The Initiative's goals are to: increase access to assistive and universally designed technologies; expand educational opportunities; promote homeownership; integrate Americans with disabilities into the workforce; expand transportation options; and promote full access to community life. 
The New Freedom Initiative Caregiving Subcommittee, composed of all HHS agencies, was established to identify and coordinate existing caregiver support activities across agencies within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The workgroup plays a leadership role in promoting HHS support of family caregivers of people with disabilities of all ages.  

Services are needed to oversee the coordination of the work of the subcommittee, including developing strategy for caregiving issues, forming workgroups, planning and facilitating meetings, performing analyses, and writing reports.
Other Functions:  The Office on Disability performs policy analysis, writes reports and makes important speeches.    The OD promotes interaction with high- level Federal, State, community and private sector partners. It arranges for the performance of complex analyses of policies and programs under its jurisdiction.  It issues reports on a variety of disability related issues.  The Director and Deputy Director of the Office on Disability are often called upon to address address a number of different audiences covering a variety of topics focusing on programs for Americans living with disabilities.

?	Program development
?	Program evaluation 
?	Policy analysis
?	Facilitation of committees dealing with complex matters

Title:  Office on Disability Program Coordination and Technical Management.

Contracting Office Address
Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management, Parklawn Building Room 5-101, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD, 20857

Description:

The Department of health and Human Services, Office on Disablity through the Program Support Center has a requirement for a contractor to provide  technical and program management services for two national initiatives as well as for program coordination between the Office on Disability (OD), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and government agencies and not-for-profit organizations, evaluation design, program analysis, report writing, and speech writing.  A description of these initiatives and associated functions follows:  

National Initiative 1:  Evaluating the Physical Fitness Initiative for Children and Youth with Disabilities

The HHS Office on Disabilities oversees the coordination, development, and implementation of programs and special initiatives within HHS that impact people with disabilities.  One of the special initiatives addresses health needs; it seeks to increase physical fitness in children and youth with disabilities.   This is an extension of the Department?s campaign against obesity through increased physical activity and good nutritional practices.  It is in concert with the Secretary and Surgeon General?s campaign on improving the health of American children through increased physical activity and good nutrition and responds to the health promotion objectives in Chapter Six of Health People 2010.  The long-range purpose is to reduce morbidity and mortality and to improve the quality of life of people with disabilities.  
Collaborating disability-based national organizations across the country will link physically fit mentors (who may or may not have a disability) with children who are disabled. The mentors will provide training and guidance to help the children become physically active by accumulating minutes of physical activity daily to earn the Presidential Active Lifestyle Award (PALA), and, with continued encouragement, strive to earn a Presidential Champions Award by accumulating points for a bronze, silver or gold medal.  The mentors will also provide the children with nutritional information and encouragement.
National Initiative 2:  Staff HHS? New Freedom Initiative Caregiver Subcommittee
In 2001, President Bush announced the New Freedom Initiative as part of a nationwide effort to remove barriers to community living for people with disabilities. Today, a full 20 percent of the U.S. population?more than 54 million Americans--are living with a disability.  Almost half of these individuals have a severe disability affecting their ability to see, hear, walk or perform other basic functions of life. In addition, there are more than 25 million family caregivers and millions more who provide aid and assistance to people with disabilities. 
The New Freedom Initiative is a comprehensive plan to ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to learn and develop skills, engage in productive work, make choices about their daily lives and participate fully in community life. The Initiative's goals are to: increase access to assistive and universally designed technologies; expand educational opportunities; promote homeownership; integrate Americans with disabilities into the workforce; expand transportation options; and promote full access to community life. 
The New Freedom Initiative Caregiving Subcommittee, composed of all HHS agencies, was established to identify and coordinate existing caregiver support activities across agencies within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The workgroup plays a leadership role in promoting HHS support of family caregivers of people with disabilities of all ages.  

Services are needed to oversee the coordination of the work of the subcommittee, including developing strategy for caregiving issues, forming workgroups, planning and facilitating meetings, performing analyses, and writing reports.
Other Functions:  The Office on Disability performs policy analysis, writes reports and makes important speeches.    The OD promotes interaction with high- level Federal, State, community and private sector partners. It arranges for the performance of complex analyses of policies and programs under its jurisdiction.  It issues reports on a variety of disability related issues.  The Director and Deputy Director of the Office on Disability are often called upon to address address a number of different audiences covering a variety of topics focusing on programs for Americans living with disabilities.

<DESC>IGLOO MAXCOLD 36 INSULATED COOLER

This hard sided, insulated cooler will be used to protect the SCSR units carried and worn by underground inspectors.  The unit will provide constant ambient air temperature to keep the unit cool in warm weather that leaves the unit susceptible to heat damage.  The unit will provide protection to normal wear and tear that would normally be caused in storage of the unit in vehicles when the SCSR is not being used.  The cooler should measure no smaller than 16.25? in length x 11.75? in width x 15.69? in height so that it is portable and small enough to fit in a vehicle seat and that the SCSR unit and the belt it is carried on will both fit in it. MSHA is seeking vendors that can supply 837 of these units.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice:  For Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) services and Socio-Economic Set-Aside Determination.

A market survey is being conducted to determine 1) if there are any potential sources of CMc as defined as a firm engaged under direct contract to a building owner, in this case the Department of Agriculture (USDA), to provide design and constructability reviews, value engineering, cost estimating, scheduling and general construction services ? the CMc is a member of the project development team during planning, design, and construction phases, along with USDA and USDA?s selected design A-E firm; and 2) if there are adequate Small Businesses, SBA-certified HUBZone, SBA-certified 8(a), or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) contractors available for a proposed project who meet the specific criteria outlined below.  This is not a Solicitation Announcement or Request for Proposal.  It does not constitute any commitment by the Government.  No award will result from this notice.  The purpose is to conduct market research to gain knowledge of potentially qualified sources.  Responses to this Sources Sought Notice will be used by the Government to make an appropriate acquisition decision.  The USDA, Agricultural Research Service (ARS) will not award a contract on the basis of responses or pay for the preparation of any information submitted.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of this notice.  After completing an analysis of the responses, the Government will determine whether to limit competition to 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, or small business firms, or to proceed with issuing an unrestricted solicitation, inviting full and open competition.

NAICS Code:  236220
Size Standard:  31.0M

Construction of a new Biosciences Building 2 on the campus of the Washington State University (WSU) in Pullman, Washington. The building will be the third phase of WSU?s Research and Education Complex (REC), and will also be known as REC 3.  The building will be located on a 0.7-acre site just north of Wilson Road and south of the existing Clark Hall.   
 
The building will have area of approximately 86,400 GSF. It will be an L-shaped structure having four floors above grade, a partial basement and a mechanical penthouse. 
The longer leg of the L will face Wilson Road and will house the laboratories and laboratory support spaces for WSU and Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists and technicians. The laboratories will be designed and constructed to meet the Biosafety Level 2 standard. The shorter leg will house the offices for the scientists, post-doctoral researchers and graduate students. To the greatest extent possible, the building?s utility systems will be tied into those of WSU, some of which are located in utility tunnels to the west and south of the site. The building will house its own chillers. WSU will relocate those of its utilities now within the building?s future footprint.     

Companies who have the experience, as well as an interest in doing business with USDA, ARS, should submit a Capabilities Statement which, for this notice, is not expected to be a proposal, but rather short statements regarding the company?s ability to demonstrate their expertise and experience in relation to the areas specified in this notice.

<SUBJECT>J--Maintenance on 3 generators
<DESC>Solicitation Number: 0407PO66860 Title: Maintenance and product installation for Generators at Navy Munitions Command at Yorktown, Va.  NAICS Code:  236220 Agency Contact Information:  Department of Interior, National Business Center/GovWorks Place of Performance:  Yorktown, Va The Government intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed-price (FFP) acquisition with Facility Support. This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the Department of the Interior Franchise Fund on the behalf of the Navy Munitions Command. This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 13.106-b(1), only one reasonable source.   Description:  The Navy Munitions Command needs (a) maintenance of 3 generators.  This maintenance includes varying degrees of inspections on the generators, as well as inspections on the generators' batteries.  Under this maintenance portion, Facility Support will also provide a 24/7  remote temperature monitoring system that would monitor all the generator alarms and emergency contact for instances outside established norms, furnish fuel deliveries and perform monthly site visits for the purpose of reading all three generators for generator hour meters and fuel levels; (b) Furnish all labor and materials to install a new Sensaphone SCADA 3000 monitoring system to monitor the new Kohler generator & ATS located at Bldg. 31; (c) Furnish all labor and materials to remove and dispose of the existing 40 Liberty batteries and replaced those with new ones.     These backup generators require 24/7 monitoring and maintenance not only to comply with state mandated fuel storage requirements, but also to assure the 100% reliability of the generators to support the Navy's classified IT systems in times of National crisis or emergencies generated by local power outages including those caused by hurricanes and natural disasters.  The selected vendor must be able to not only monitor but respond immediately 24/7/365 to any requirement for troubleshooting problems and repairs, including fuel issues.  A third monitoring system will be placed on the third generator and will have to be linked to the other two generators. The period of performance for this effort is for one year from date of award.  Interested parties must identify their interest and capabilities by January 03, 2007.  This is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  However, all information received will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<SUBJECT>A -- Notice of Draft RFP Release - MDA Advanced Research Center (ARC)
<DESC>This special notice is informational only and is NOT a solicitation request for proposals (RFP) or a solicitation invitation for bids (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.

Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation 5.205(c), this is a special notice that the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) intends to issue a competitive 100 percent small business set-aside Request for Proposals (RFP) (HQ0147-07-R-0001; Classification Code: A - Research and Development; North American Industrial Classification System [NAICS] Code: 541710 - Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences) for program and operational support services for the Advanced Research Center (ARC), which is a High Performance Computing Research, Development facility located in Huntsville, AL.  The contemplated requirement includes, but is not limited to, labor support, facility and operation and maintenance support, research and development support, and acquisition support.

This Draft RFP (DRFP) notice seeks industry comments and questions concerning MDA's intended acquisition strategy of awarding a 100 percent small business set-aside indefinite-delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract with a potential period of performance of eight (8) years (two-year base period with six one-year options).  It is expected that the resulting contract will contain contract line item numbers (CLINs) for firm-fixed price labor support and cost reimbursable items (to include facility and operation and maintenance expenditures, hardware and software, contractor travel and related other direct costs).  The target release date for the contemplated RFP is early January 2007.  The RFP and all other acquisition notices and announcements will be posted on the World Wide Web via the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) (http://www.fedbizopps.gov/) and/or Federal Data Technical Solutions (FedTeDS) (https://www.fedteds.gov/) Internet sites, as appropriate (note that FedTeDS is a restricted website that requires a username and password).  MDA anticipates hosting a solicitation Pre-Proposal Conference and Site Visit in Huntsville, AL, in late January 2007.  Instructions for the location and date of the solicitation Pre-Proposal Conference and Site Visit will be published under a separate special notice on FedBizOpps.

The following draft documents are available on FedBizOpps with the publication of this special DRFP notice:  1) Organizational Conflicts of Interest RFP Provisions and Contract Clauses; 2) Section B Preamble and CLINs; 3) Section C Labor Category Positions and Labor Category Descriptions; 4) Section J Sample Facility Lease, Lease Data Sheet and associated documents; 5) Section J Sample Resume; 6) Section L Instructions, Conditions and Notices To Bidders; 7) Section M, Evaluation Factors For Award; and 8) acquisition milestone schedule.

The following draft documents are available on FedTeDS with the publication of this special DRFP notice:  1) Department of Defense Form 254, Contract Security Classification; 2) Basic Contract Section C Performance Work Statement; 3) Task Order 0001 Section C Performance Work Statement; 4) Task Order 0002 Section C Performance Work Statement; and 5) Section J Contract Data Requirement List and Instructions.

The contract awardee and its key personnel will be required to possess and retain up to Top Secret clearances.  The anticipated acquisition will not be open to participation by foreign firms at the prime contractor, teaming member, or subcontractor levels.

As stated above this special notice is for information purposes only - it does not constitute an RFP nor is it a commitment by the Government.  The Government will not pay for any costs incurred as a result of this notice.

Potential offerors are cautioned that the information provided in this special notice, DRFP documents and contemplated RFP are subject to change as determined by the Government.  Potential offerors are encouraged to check the FedBizOpps and FedTeDS Internet sites for updated and/or additional DRFP information (such as a draft Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan, draft Section J Past Performance Information attachments, a Government-Furnished Equipment List, and a Facility Computer Network Diagram) and other special notices and announcements.

    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.

is held-

    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:

    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

                                   EXPATRIATES (JUNE 2006). 

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held- 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that {Check one}:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<SOLNBR>07-42

<DESC>Background (Please see below for Modification #1):
The Office of Public Information is actively involved in responding to the 1987 Congressional mandate ?...to develop outreach programs aimed at the transfer of the latest scientific findings to all health professionals...in rural communities and other areas, and, to publicize the availability of its products and services...?  In response to this charge, the National Library of Medicine?s (NLM) Office of Communications and Public Liaison (OCPL) would like to acquire the services of a contractor to assist in the overall coordination of NLM?s NEWSLINE quarterly production.  All articles for the publication are intended to be of primary interest to the public, broadly defined, to include not only consumers, but the library community, health professionals, and the scientific community.  

Purpose and Task Description:
The purpose of this procurement is to promote NLM?s work and activities to NLM employees, the public, health professionals, and the scientific community.  Particularly, NLM has identified the need for a contractor to assist in the overall coordination of two (2) issues of the NLM Newsline magazine?s quarterly production.   The NLM OCPL staff will be responsible for identifying topics to be researched and drafted by the contractor.  The contractor will be responsible for gathering the materials to develop the content for the publication and ultimately authoring all of the articles.   NLM staff shall review all content for accuracy and approve all articles for publication.  The magazine, on average, runs about 24 pages and averages between 20 and 30 articles.  The estimated number of labor hours for two (2) issues is 1000.  The expected period of performance is from the date of award to September 29, 2007. Specifically, the NLM is seeking the assistance of a contractor to:     

1)	Coordinate the production of the NLM Newsline Magazine with the production of the NIHMedlinePlus magazine.  This is intended to provide for the consideration and potential transfer of content solutions identified in the production of the NIHMedlinePlus magazine.  Ideally, such solutions should enhance and improve the overall appearance, readability, and usability of the magazine?s content for the public;
2)	Research, draft, revise, and prepare articles, in consultation with NLM staff, for publication in the quarterly issues of the Newsline magazine;
3)	Coordinate the development, drafting, revision, technical review, fact-checking, approval, and submission of articles for publication;
4)	Prepare for moderating twice-weekly conference call meetings of NLM OCPL staff, and contractors involved in producing the magazine.  It is not expected that all meetings with OCPL staff and other contractors in preparing articles for NLM NEWSLINE magazine can be conducted by phone or email.  Contractor should budget for travel to the NLM campus approximately once a month;
5)	Act as a liaison between contract writers (any subcontractors hired by the contractor), information sources, NLM staff and others (including design contractor and printer) to ensure the efficient review, revision and approval of editorial material; and 
6)	Contribute to ongoing editorial and design oversight (working with NLM?s graphic design artists in developing the layout for the content) to ensure the highest quality publication.    Contractor is not expected to provide camera-ready copy for the printed version of the publication, or to layout each issue.  Materials are to be submitted in electronic form and shipped to NLM design and print contractors.

Previous issues of the publication that are available online do not constitute a reasonable basis for estimating the nature and level of services and activities that will be requested of a contractor. The NLM is seeking innovative and effective approaches for responding to the proposal, encouraging appropriate innovations in focus, style and direction.

Evaluation Factors

 Selection of an offeror for award will be based on an evaluation of responses against 1) technical factors, and 2) cost/price.  The following technical evaluation criteria below are listed in relative importance with weights assigned for evaluation purposes.

Technical Merit.  Quality and clarity of approach to accomplish the objectives of this statement of work. Evidence of work of a similar nature and of ability to accomplish milestones within the time frame. (50 points)

USAFE CSS/SCML

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
TO PROCURE USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
BRAND NAME:  Cisco Equipment

Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1(c), Application for Brand Name Description.

1.  Agency and Contracting Activity: 

The requiring activity for this action is USAFE CSS/SCML, Ramstein Air Force Base, Germany. The contracting activity is DISA/DITCO Europe, Building 143, 67681 Sembach-Heuberg, Germany.

2.  Nature/Description of Action:

The proposed contractual action is for other than full and open competition based on 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1(c), Application for Brand Name Description. Request approval to solicit, negotiate, and award a contract to resellers of CISCO equipment.  A firm-fixed price commercial item type contract is planned and will be issued pursuant to FAR 13.5.  The contract is for the purchase of Cisco SONET equipment, required for the network upgrade at the RAF Lakenheath, UK, Technical Control Facility.

3.  Description of Supplies/Services:

Requirement is for the purchase of various Cisco Synchronous Network Equipment (SONET) for the upgrade of the RAF Lakenheath, UK, Technical Control Facility (TCF) Phase II under the HQ USAFE TCF Modernization Program.

4.  Identification of Statutory Authority:

10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1(c), Application for Brand Name Description.

5. Demonstration of Contractor?s Unique Qualifications:

 This equipment purchase is part of an ongoing MAJCOM-wide TCF Modernization Program and will be an extension of previously purchased and installed equipment.  CISCO is required to ensure consistency in the design, continuity of training, ease of use, and interoperability, as this equipment is being installed into an existing SONET network.  Additionally,  CISCO SONET is required to be able to work with our existing fiber optic cards which are being supplied from a previous upgrade. If another brand was used there would be the additional cost of the Optical cards.  Furthermore, USAFE/A6 is deploying an enterprise remote monitoring and management solution command-wide, which further justifies the CISCO solution as it allows the USAFE Network Operations and Security Center to use a single tool to manage all USAFE SONET equipment.

6.  FedBizOpps Announcement/Potential Sources

The synopsis will be combined with the solicitation in accordance with FAR part 12.

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price
	
The Contracting Officer will compete the requirement with resellers of CISCO equipment to ensure prices are fair and reasonable.

8.  Description of Market Research 

The research that produced the overarching solution for the USAFE TCF Modernization Program included the evaluation of several technologies and equipment manufacturers.  This included CISCO, Acorn, NET, Marconi, Carrier Access, Nortel Networks, and Timplex to name a few.  The evaluation consisted of personal experiences of USAFE personnel, review of product documentation obtained from the web, vendor provided demonstrations and product documentation, review of currently fielded equipment, and GSA schedule and retail pricing lists.  Based on the evaluations, an equipment suite was chosen based on capabilities, integration, and price.  This solution included the selection of the CISCO SONET product line as the optical layer multiplexer.

9.  Supporting Facts:

This Brand Name of equipment is requested to maintain uniformity, common troubleshooting and maintenance techniques, a standardized training program and economy of resources across the USAFE Theater. 

10.  Listing of Interested sources: 

World Wide Technology, NAS5-02144, 60 Weldon Parkway, Saint Louis, MO 63043, 314-919-1431
Government Micro Resources Inc (GMRI), NAS5-01145, 7403 Gateway Court, Manassas, VA 20109, 800-232-4671

11.  Actions taken to remove barriers to competition: 

No action has been taken to remove barriers to competition. USAFE CSS/SCML must remain with the Cisco product line to ensure continuity, compatibility and consistency of existing equipment. The Government would incur costs in training of personnel and reengineering of non-CISCO equipment for integration with existing equipment as detailed above.  Competition is limited to multiple resellers of CISCO equipment.    

12.  Statement of Period of Performance and/or Delivery Schedule

The Government anticipates a 30-day delivery period after contractor?s receipt of order

13.  Reference to Approved Acquisition Plan (AP)

Not applicable.
