<DESC>This contract is for the purpose of restoring irrigation water to the Hanksville Irrigation Company.     A flood event in October 2006 washed out the existing irrigation dam in the Fremont River leaving the water users without means of diverting water to approximately 800 acres of irrigated fields.      

The items of work required include the construction of a new  concrete diversion dam in the corridor of the Fremont River approximately 2 miles upstream of the community of Hanksville.     Additional components of the diversion structure and delivery system include a rock raceway for fish passage at the diversion structure, a concrete sediment sluicing structure, HDPE irrigation pipeline, and a new concrete water control structure at the downstream end of the pipeline for delivering water to the existing irrigation ditches.     The water control structure will also incorporate a suspended pipe bridge over the river providing water to a portion of the irrigated farmland opposite the water control structure.

As the diversion structure is in the river itself and portions of the irrigation pipeline are at the edge of the active river corridor, rock armament will be required in order to protect and sustain the life span of the proposed engineering practices.


THIS IS NOT SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES.
THIS WILL BE COMPETED FULL-OPEN COMPETITION.

It is GSA's intent to solicit this requirement through Full and Open Competition utilizing Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable Source Selection procedures.  The LPTA method, FAR 15.101-2, has been determined by the GSA Project Team to be in the best interests of the Government.  The NAICS for this procurement is code 236220.  The resultant contract will be a firm fixed price contract.

The work includes but is not limited to constructing two (2) new air intake shafts adjacent to the existing side wall air intake louvers.  The shaft construction will be a face brick veneer, which shall match the existing building's brick skin, over Concrete Masonry Unit (CMU) backup.  The masonry will be supported and braced by a galvanized steel structure.  A new foundation system will be employed, consisting of new concrete beams and footings.  The top of the new shaft will be enclosed with a stainless steel woven wire mesh grill factory welded to a stainless steel tube frame, which is attached to the galvanized steel structure.  The stainless steel components are finished to match the existing louvers.  

For this procurement the GSA Project Team shall evaluate all properly received offers consistent with FAR 15.101-2, ?Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Source Selection process?. As defined in FAR 15.101-2 (a) the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process is appropriate when best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price. FAR 15.101-1 (b) (1) states that the evaluation factors and significant sub factors that establish the requirements of acceptability shall be set forth in the RFP. The GSA Project Team shall utilize the following factors as requirements for acceptability;  1) Firm lists a minimum of three (3) projects completed in the past five (5) years of a similar scope of work that have a total construction value of at least comparable dollar size. These shall be projects in which the offeror performed duties as the general contractor. Projects performed with a subcontractor who acted in a teaming capacity to assist with general contractor duties shall also be considered acceptable.  2) Identification and contact information of all personnel and subcontractors involved in the required three (3) aforementioned projects shall be provided for the GSA Project Team to confirm performance. The GSA Project Team intends to collect information regarding performance via reference checks.  All proposals received shall be evaluated for acceptability, but shall not be ranked using non-cost/ price factors.

<DESC>Contract N00019-05-C-0051 is currently in place with Diagnostics Solutions, Jacksonville, NC, logistics, technical and data management services in support of the CH-46E helicopter Aircraft Integrated Maintenance System (AIMS).  The current AIMS accumulates vibration and performance data during ground and flight operations which then checked for exceedences that will drive corrective actiction maintenance actions.  Due to the high utilization rates for the CH-46E helicopter operating in support of the Global War on terrorism, the data is accumulating much faster than expected.  As such, two additional man-years are required under the existing contract to keep up with demand.  Diagnostics Solutions is the only company to possess the epertise and knowledge of the CH-46 AIMS that is required to continue this effort without unacceptable delays and dupliation of costs.  The Government intends to award a firm fixed price modicification to contract N00019-05-C-0051 to increase the current level of effort.  The period of performance for this additional work will be a three (3) month base period with one 12 month option.  Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) Branch intends to negotiate and award a cost-reimbursement completion-type contract on a noncompetitive basis to the University of California at San Diego (UCSD) for an initial two-year effort, with three one-year options, to operate, support and enhance the NIH Blueprint Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF). (Statutory authority 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1) 
The NIF is an inventory and registry of information and resources within a system employing multiple strategies that enable neuroscientists to identify resources and data relevant to their research interests.  A key feature of the system enables users to make concept based queries (spanning multiple levels of biological organization and function) within and across the diverse types of resources and data constituting the NIF inventory and registry. Implementation of this feature critically relies on advancing semantic interoperability by developing and implementing ontologies relevant to the data and resources associated with neuroscience research.  The participating NIH Neuroscience Blueprint Institutes and Centers (ICs) recognize the importance of expediting system availability to the broader research community to expand the NIF inventory, since the value of the system multiplies as its inventory becomes increasingly populated with trusted content.  Similarly, the NIH Blueprint ICs also recognize the reliability and usefulness of NIF depend upon its being current with respect to both content and implementation of technological best practices.   
Previous NIF support included a limited one year period for development and testing of NIFv1, but not its operation, support and enhancement, once developed.  Work and services to be acquired under this procurement include (1) providing  facilities, materials, services, and technical and scientific expertise to host, operate, maintain, support, and enhance the functionalities and components of the NIF; (2) maintaining, modifying, updating, extending, and enriching the ontological underpinnings of the system, known as the NIF vocabularies, and engaging in community efforts to assure their timely public availability, adoption by the research community,  and consistency with the principles of the Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry;  (3) further populating the NIF inventory and the NIF document archive; (4)  providing support and training on using the NIF system for both queries and resource registration; (5) and conducting outreach through scientific events, publications, partnerships, and other means to increase public awareness and participation in NIF, and to promote and advance semantic and computational interoperability for locating and using research resources and data within the worldwide  neuroscience research community.  
The work and services are required in a timely, efficient, and cost-effective manner for the government necessitates confluence of four factors: (1)  computational resources and expertise sufficient to impart  in-depth knowledge and experience with providing national cyber infrastructure(2) expertise familiar with the diverse resources for conducting neuroscience research and acquiring  and using neuroscience-relevant data across multiple biological scales (3) experience in developing and implementing neuroscience-relevant ontologies consistent with OBO Foundry principles, and (4) fundamental understanding of the components and functionalities of NIFv1. UCSD has the vision and needed experience to expedite the implementation and delivery of this information framework.  These needs are entirely satisfied by UCSD.  (1) As an organized research unit of UCSD, the San Diego Supercomputing Center (SDSC) is internationally recognized for its leadership in grid computing, bioinformatics and data management. SDSC provides UCSD researchers and students with a wide range of services and resources for high performance computing, thus endowing UCSD with  in-depth knowledge and experience about providing cyberinfrastructure. (2) Through its Center for Research in Biological Systems (CRSB), UCSD has established a cadre of investigators engaged in multidisciplinary and multi-scale studies familiar with the expanding universe of resources needed for acquiring and integrating multiple data types to understand functional relationships in central nervous system processes.  A major project of the CRSB is the Biomedical Informatics Research Network (BIRN), which builds infrastructure and technologies to enable national, large scale biomedical data mining and refinement.  The BIRN testbeds involving neuroscience are internationally recognized as models for data federation.  (3) UCSD led the focused integration of the semantic modules and vocabularies of NIFv1 (including important contributions which it uniquely provided), encoding them in Web Ontology Language (OWL) to enable them to be machine readable and thus permit possible future information inference.  UCSD also has a working relationship with the NIH National Roadmap Center for Biomedical Ontologies (NCBO) to assure consistency of the NIFSTD vocabularies with OBO Foundry principles.  Separately, UCSD also is collaborating with NCBO to develop an OBO compliant ontology for neurodegenerative disorders, again demonstrating leadership in establishing vital national partnerships for achieving machine readable semantic interoperability in the neurosciences (4) UCSD has detailed knowledge of NIF components and functionalities. UCSD greatly contributed to the NIFv1 tools for semantic description and registration of resources such as catalogues and databases, which enable concept mapping and deep queries of these resources. UCSD  took the lead in implementing the NIF web component of the current Framework.  It played an important role in developing the necessary web services enabling interaction among NIF components, hosted the NIF beta, and provided valuable web tutorials explaining the system. Another source within the NIF project would cause inordinate delays in project implementation and result in more government staff time in overseeing and re-orienting a new contractor to the NIF and its requirements.   See Numbered Note 22 and 26.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Subject:  Synopsis for the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Battle Command System (IBCS) Development Program, Request for Proposal (RFP) W31P4Q-06-R-0275 <BR><BR>Description:  <BR><BR>The United States Army, through the Integrated Air and Mi ssile Defense (IAMD) Project Office, Huntsville, Alabama, and the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM) Acquisition Center, Redstone Arsenal, AL, has a requirement for a full and open competitive procurement for the Integrated Air and Missile Defe nse (IAMD) Battle Command System (IBCS) Development Program procurement, which will be issued by the U.S. Army AMCOM, Acquisition Center, Bldg 5303, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama 35898-5280.<BR><BR>The IBCS Development Program (FY 08 - FY 14) will encompass ac quiring program management, systems engineering, integration, manufacturing, test, logistics, initial production, training and deployment of the IBCS Major End Items (MEIs), the IAMD Integrated Fire Control Network (IFC-Net) and supporting products. <BR><B R>Todays Air and Missile Defense (AMD) systems, composed of weapons, sensors and Battle Management, Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (BMC4I) end items, operate as self-contained entities with inherent design limitations.  These  systems have limited interoperability with other AMD systems and the joint community, but are unable to conduct fully integrated operations.  The Army intends to connect individual weapon (launchers with interceptors) and sensor components directly onto a  network to achieve net centric operations utilizing IBCS Development Program products.  This includes integration and leveraging of existing and planned Future Combat Systems (FCS), Missile Defense Agency (MDA), Single Integrated Air Picture (SIAP), Army Battle Command System (ABCS), and Army IAMD capabilities.<BR><BR>The contracting strategy calls for a negotiated procurement, with full and open competition, for the selection of an IBCS development source using a rolling down-select method.  The source selection will be conducted in two steps. The first step will be the award of up to two (2) Phase I  IBCS Preliminary Design contracts with follow-on Phase II/III options.  The second step in the source selection consists of an evaluation of Phase I effor ts and updated proposals to select a single offeror that presents the best value to the Government to obtain an award/exercise an option for a Phase I Post IBCS Preliminary Design effort leading to a subsequent Phase II  IBCS System Development and Demons tration (SDD) option to be exercised after IAMD Milestone (MS) B approval. Additionally, at the discretion of the Government, the Phase II IBCS early contingency capability option(s) could also be exercised at the culmination of IAMD MS B.  <BR><BR>The ori ginal contract award (Phase I) will be for an eleven (11) month period of performance.  The original contract award and all options to be exercised during Phase I will be Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) efforts.  The requirement will have a follow-on Post IBCS Preliminary Design Option 1, which will be for an additional four (4) month period of performance.  The requirement will also have an IBCS Phase I Extension Activities Option 2, which will be for an additional eight (8) month period of performance.  The SD D Phase of the contract (Phase II) will have a total period of performance of fifty-two (52) months.  All options exercised during Phase II will be issued as Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) efforts.  This will include Option 3, for IBCS SDD effort; Option 4 , for Additional IBCS Demonstration End items; Option 5, for IBCS Early Contingency Capability (ECC) Implementation and Demonstration; Option 6-8, which will be one year options for IBCS ECC Interim Logistics Support; and Option 9 for IBCS Low Rate Initial  Production (LRIP) Long Lead Items.  The Production and Deployment Phase (Phase III) of the contract will have an eleven (11) month period of performance.  The requirement will include Option 10 for Test and Engineering Services, which will be issued as a CPFF effort; Option 11, for LRIP, which will be issued as a CPIF effort; Option 12, for LRIP Contractor Logistics Support, which will be issued as a CPFF effort ; and Option 13, for New Equipment Training, which will be issue as a CPFF effort.<BR><BR>OFFERORS ARE ADVISED THAT PERFORMANCE ON THIS PROPOSED CONTRACT WILL REQUIRE ACCESS TO DEFENSE INFORMATION / EQUIPMENT THAT IS NOT CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE FOR RELEASE TO NON-U.S. COMPANIES.  THEREFORE, PARTICIPATION AT THE PRIME CONTRACTOR LEVEL IS RESTRICTED TO U.S. COMPANIES.  REQUESTS FROM FOREIGN INDUSTRY FOR THE IBCS DEVELOPMENT SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE HONORED.

Th e anticipated period of performance will be twenty-four (24)months.  <BR><BR>The RDECOM-AC determined full and open competition is not possible for the following reasons:<BR><BR>"	The holographic images must be created from LIDAR (Light Detection and Rangi ng) imagery and intelligence data directly from a computer and scalable to any size.  <BR>"	Holographic images must illuminate with only a single point light source to include natural sunlight, portable flashlights, or LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes).  <BR>" 	3-D holograms will be used in theater operations requiring portable (not needing any power or ancillary viewing equipment) and compact (small enough to fit in a military issued rucksack) specifications.  <BR>"	Much of the intelligence and imagery data to support theater operations is classified so vendors must have an accredited, classified lab space for hologram development and adequate security clearances for personnel.  <BR>"	Associated services include collecting imagery data from theater, printing and  preparing the holograms, and shipping to the final theater destination. <BR><BR>

<DESC>02/04/2008 Updated questions and answers are attached (there is a change  to Question 11's answer). 02/01/2008  Questions and answers are attached. SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (Not a Notice of Solicitation) This is a Sources Sought Synopsis.  There is no solicitation available at  this time.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for Market Research  purposes only.  This market survey is conducted to identify potential  sources capable of meeting the requirements for providing Air Force SBIR  contractors with technical assistance in accordance with USC Title 15,  Sec. 638 Paragraph q, Discretionary Technical Assistance.  The primary  focus of this assistance is intended to be in the area of planning and  preparation for commercialization of technologies, products, or services  developed under Air Force SBIR contracts.  Technical assistance provided  under this effort is not intended to focus on solving specific technical  problems that arise in the course of technology development under a  particular SBIR contract.  A proposed draft Performance Work Statement  (PWS) is attached to provide respondents a better understanding of the  needs of the AF SBIR Program and the respondent?s potential ability to  meet the Government?s requirement. The Government envisions a one year award with two subsequent 12 month  renewal options.  In the first year, assistance efforts will be limited to  Phase I SBIR recipients only, in accordance with the tasks described in  the draft PWS, Sec. 1.1. The total value of the first year effort is  expected to be limited to not more than $2M.  In the second and third  year, support efforts are expected to expand to include assistance to  Phase II SBIR recipients.  Additional tasks are described in Sec. 1.2 of  the daft PWS.  At present, the total value of the second and third year  efforts are expected to be limited to not more than $4M a year, however;  anticipated changes in the governing law may allow for a value of as high  as $6.5M a year.  Firms responding are expected to show the ability to  develop a flexible plan to provide increased levels of assistance if  additional funding is available in the second and third year. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their size,  particularly if they are a small business, small disadvantaged business,  woman-owned small business, HUBZone small business or service disabled  veteran-owned small business, and should also indicate if the firm is  foreign-owned. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541712  applies to this acquisition with a size standard of 1500 employees. The AF is requesting that respondents propose a Federal Supply Schedule,  in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.4 for this  requirement.  Respondents must propose the schedule that they feel is  appropriate for this acquisition.  The AF anticipates that the task order  will be for 1 year with 2 option years. All interested parties shall submit a capabilities package that explicitly  demonstrates capabilities and expertise related to this effort.  Foreign  contractor participation is not permitted. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this  synopsis nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated  with preparing or submitting a response to this notice.  This synopsis  does not constitute a Request for Quotation (RFQ), Request for Proposal  (RFP), or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does this issuance restrict the  Government?s acquisition approach.  The Government reserves the right to  reject in whole or in part any industry input as a result of this  announcement.  The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a  part of this effort.  If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary  data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary  information.  If the Government decides to award a contract for this or  related effort, a combined synopsis/solicitation will be published.

<DESC>REQUIREMENTS:
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has a Federal Business Opportunity (FedBizOpps) for a parcel of land.  FEMA is seeking expressions of interest from owners of vacant parcels of land. 

The intended use of the leased land is to provide storage for travel trailers and/or mobile homes which were used by the Louisiana Housing Task Force as temporary emergency housing units (EHU) to those individuals displaced from their permanent residences by Hurricane Katrina.  These EHU will not be occupied.

General Services Administration (GSA) will enter into a lease contract on behalf of FEMA with the owner whose parcel of land is technically acceptable for the intended use of the Government.  FEMA intends to lease only the land that is determined to meet all the governmental technical requirements.  The determination of technical acceptability is made by the GSA Contracting Officer.  In making a determination, the GSA Contracting Officer will use technical criteria provided by FEMA program officials, other federal agencies? guidelines and technical contractors who are responsible for the operation and maintenance of the site. 

The determination process is two-phased.  The first phase will use the criteria listed in this ad to determine if expressions of interest meet the minimum criteria for the intended use by the Government.  Those individuals responding with an expression of interest that meet these minimum criteria will be provided with a Solicitation for Offer (SFO).  The second phase of determination is based upon the additional technical requirements specified within the SFO.  Only the offers that meet all the technical requirements of both this ad and the SFO will be considered for award.

Land owners who meet the following minimum criteria are requested to provide expressions of interest to GSA.

1.	Land in one of the following parishes in Louisiana:  East Feliciana, West Feliciana, St. Helena, Tangipahoa, Livingston, East Baton Rouge, West Baton Rouge, Pointe Coupee, Ascension.  Additionally,  St. Landry, Evangeline, Allen and Beauregard parishes may be considered if the land is located either with direct frontage to Hwy 190 or is located north of 190. 
2.	Parcels of Land no smaller than 175 and no larger than 540 acres.
3.	Land that is flat and hard-surfaced (no loose soil and no crop lands), cleared of    	  	trees, debris and other impediments to support travel trailers and mobile homes.
4. 	Land owner will allow placement of gravel/rock on roadways and lanes on the 	property with possible culvert/piping to make property more accessible and 	conducive to staging travel trailers and mobile homes.
5.	Land that has direct access from primary/secondary paved roads.  Preference is for land with a minimum of 200 feet frontage on these roads with easy access from a major four-lane divided highway and/or interstate highway.  Travel trailers and full size mobile homes (14? x 70?x 13.5?) need to be towed to the site from throughout the state of Louisiana
6.	Land that is has water and electric service to the property is required.
7.	Land that is not wetlands.
8.	Land that meets local government ordinances, zoning requirements, and any other 	necessary approvals for government intended use (parish approval required).
9.	Land that complies with all necessary environmental, archeological and historical 	regulations.
10.	Occupancy is required by March 1, 2008. 

The expression of interest should include, as a minimum, the following information: 

1.	Owner name, address, phone number, fax number, and email address if 	available.
2.	Written proof of ownership and/or of the legal control necessary to lease the land 	(e.g. copy of deed, mortgage document, or master lease stating the ability to 	sublease for the government?s intended use).
3.	A legal description of the property.
4.	Description of the land:  size (number of acres), physical characteristics, past and 	current use.
5.	Location of the land:  including the municipal (physical) address, city, parish, and 	a small map showing the location and access to the property.
6.	Picture of the site.
7.	If representing an owner, a written agreement with the owner showing authority 	to represent the owner.
8.	Written parish approval for the Government?s intended use.

All expressions of interest shall be addressed as follows and mailed to:
General Services Administration 
Expression of Interest to Vacant Land
3535 S. Sherwood Forest Blvd., Suite 150
Baton Rouge, LA 70816

SOLICITATION PROCESS:
Typically, GSA will solicit offers from all technically acceptable sites.  Site acceptability will be established by the process of determination described above and within the Solicitation for Offer.  The leasing action will be awarded to the lowest price technically acceptable offer.

LEASE TERM:
2 years, 1- year firm term. 

RENTAL RATE:
An annual rate of return on the estimated value of the selected site is offered as a lease rental payment.  The Government will not accept an increased value assessment or an excessive interest rate due to the nature of this requirement.  The intent of the Government is not to operate a commercial business on the property and, therefore, there is no income for consideration in determining a fair rental rate.


RIGHT-OF-ENTRY FORM:
The owner will be required to provide access and entry onto the property to FEMA and its representatives for the purpose of performance of environmental and other assessment to determine technical feasibility for intended use.

<CONTACT>Tuana A. Williams Contract Specialist 3039696648     tuana_a_williams@nbc.gov;
<DESC>The National Business Center (NBC), Department of the Interior (DOI), is one of four federal payroll providers and one of five federal HR Shared Service Centers (SSC).  The NBC provides personnel action processing and payroll processing to its customers using the Federal Personnel and Payroll System (FPPS).  Currently NBC services to 40 federal agencies using FPPS.  Many of the agencies have contracts with providers of automated staffing solutions such as Avue's "Staffing Module", Monster Government Solutions's "Hiring Management" (also known as QuickHire), and OPM's "USA Staffing".  The NBC intends to implement interfaces between the above systems and the FPPS and any other automated staffing solution currently used by FPPS customers.  NBC will establish an interface from FPPS to the vendor's hosting site. FPPS customers utilize the automated staffing systems based on contracts they have directly with the automated staffing vendors.   The NBC itself does not have direct contract with the automated staffing vendors.  The NBC intends to establish a contractual basis for an interface with each vendor currently hosting an automated staffing solution used by FPPS customers.  The NBC's intent is that automate staffing solution providers interface with FPPS through a standardized interface, rather than through proprietary, vendor unique interfaces.  These interfaces are to be real to near-real time using web services, e.g. SOAP based messaging. A Request for Proposal (RFP) is anticipated to be issued and will include the following requirements::  1.	Proposal for concept of operations. 2.	Vendor's current interface specification 3.	Vendor's current interface technologies 4.	Analysis of differences between the vendor's current interface and the NBC standardized interface 5.	Cost to implement the vendor's end of the standardized interface. 6.	Cost to operate the vendor's end of the standardized interface. Note that acquisition of an automated staffing solution is out of scope for the RFP. In accordance with FAR 15.201- Exchanges With Industry Before Receipt of Proposal, the NBC anticipates holding a pre-solicitation requirements meeting with qualified vendors to review the proposed NBC standardized interface between FPPS and automated staffing solutions.  NBC will provide in advance to qualified vendors the proposed specification for the standardized interface.  In addition to the specification, the NBC will provide information on proposed workflows, events, and triggers between the automated staffing solutions and the FPPS.  NBC will meet separately with each qualified vendor and make modifications to the specification based on the results of the meeting.  The modified specification will become a key component of the requirements in the RFP.  The pre-solicitation meeting will be held in the Washington, DC area the fourth week in February, 2008. The Government has already identified potential vendors as Avue, Monster Government Solutions, and OPM.  In addition, the NBC believes there may be other qualified vendors.  To qualify, a vendor must meet the following criteria: 1) be the developer and supplier of an automated staffing solution; 2) host the automated staffing solution at a vendor location; 3) have a current contract with an FPPS customer agency; 4) and the contract period of performance is current and will be in effect in 2009. Please submit the following information to be considered for invitation to the pre-solicitation meeting: 1.	Name of your company 2.	Name and contact information of the person at your company who will coordinate your participation in the meeting.  3.	Web site URL for company 4.	Name of the Automated Staffing solution you provide to FPPS customers 5.	Location (city, state) where you host the solution for FPPS customers 6.	FPPS Customers to whom you provide the solution must be listed below 7.	For each FPPS customer to whom you provide the automated staffing system provide the: a.	Contract Number b.	Contract Period of Performance c.	Name and contact information of the Contracting Officer  d.	Name and contact information of the Contracting Officer's Representative  Any information provided to NBC may be used to confirm your qualification prior to you receiving an invitation. Agencies who are serviced by NBC using FPPS are:   1.	Advisory Council On Historical Preservation 2.	African Development Foundation 3.	Arctic Research Commission 4.

<SUBJECT>Z--RFI FOR INFORMATION AND EXPRESSION OF INTEREST FOR ALTERNATE USES FOR KSC CITRUS GROVE LAND
<SOLNBR>EUL-01-2008
<RESPDATE>031408
<ARCHDATE>02042009

<DESC>A.  DESCRIPTION The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) at the John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) invites industry to submit a response to this Request for Information (RFI).  KSC is seeking information and formal expressions of interest from industry, academia, and other prospective parties to identify potential alternative land uses and activities for approximately 700 acres of citrus groves currently in active production on space center property. This notice is issued by NASA as a RFI. This is not a notice of solicitation and does NOT constitute a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation. This RFI is for internal NASA planning purposes only and seeks to provide interested parties an opportunity to assist NASA in planning for innovative and environmentally sound uses of land currently operated for agricultural production and related research activities. This RFI is subject to the FAR Provision 52.215-3 entitled "Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (OCT 1997)". In addition, this notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract, a lease, or any other land use arrangement, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response to this request. NASA intends to use the information provided in response to this RFI to determine, in its sole discretion, the potential for alternative land uses deemed appropriate and compatible with NASA?s operation at KSC in support of the agency?s missions. NASA reserves the right to breifly discuss with any respondent to this RFI information provided if deemed to be in the best interest of the Government.  NASA may also explore potential short term or long term land use arrangements for uses approved by NASA, subject to environmental assessment in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).  B. PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND The purpose of this RFI is to gather planning information on prospective alternative uses to the current citrus grove acreage under active production.  This request is limited to the specific acreage identified in the attached map as ?in production? groves (See Attachment 1).	Responses should not address other KSC lands. The approximately 700 acres of citrus grove land in production are owned by NASA and currently managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) as part of the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge pursuant to NASA?s agreement with the USFWS.  Under the terms of the current USFWS Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with The Florida Research Center for Agricultural Sustainability Inc., caretaking responsibilities ended on January 15, 2008 and fruit picking rights expire on July 31, 2008.  The attached map identifies the subject acreage and also shows the approximate acres in production per group.   USFWS has decided that it will not continue to manage these areas for citrus production and will either seek restoration of the groves to native habitat or turn management of the grove land over to NASA, the property owner, as potential sites for future development and interim land uses as NASA may permit. Some of the acreage currently in production has been tentatively designated by NASA for future development supportive of NASA?s mission.  Approximately 160 acres are within the area identified for future development of a technology and commerce park, Exploration Park, and the area anticipated to be used for future expansion of the KSC Visitor Complex or associated outreach activities. In addition, up to 100 acres of the subject land is currently under evaluation for potential use for a renewable energy project pursuant to an MOU between NASA-KSC and Florida Power and Light (FP&L). Depending on the proposed use of lands, NASA may explore the use of NASA?s Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) authority or other land use arrangements as may be appropriate to facilitate approved uses.	Under NASA?s EUL authority, the agency may lease out real property for its Fair Market Value (FMV) and retain the consideration in support of NASA?s mission.  The subject property is not excess property and NASA will not consider, nor is it authorized, to dispose of the property through sale. Failure to respond to this RFI does not exclude any interested party from future consideration for potential land use opportunities which may be announced or solicited by NASA. C.  TYPES OF USES SOUGHT AND LIMITATIONS  The goal of this RFI is to identify viable alternative uses for the grove lands currently in production at KSC and to determine the capability and capacity of interested parties offering ideas to successfully implement and manage such activities under land use arrangements with NASA. Responses are not required to encompass the entire available acreage nor specific sites. NASA wishes to encourage a broad range of creative ideas in response to this RFI.  The types of uses NASA would anticipate include but are not limited to: renewable energy projects, environmentally advantageous agricultural research, and pioneering concepts for land usage.   NASA does not intend to permit residential uses.   D.  INFORMATION REQUESTED FROM INTERESTED PARTIES  This RFI has no overall page limit with all response received by the requested date of March 14, 2008 to be included for review.  All submissions regarding this RFI received after March 14, 2008 may be excluded from review.  Responses should be as detailed as necessary to enable NASA to fully understand the proposed land use and associated activities required to implement, as well as the capabilities of the proposing entity to manage the activities.	Responses should include the following information as a minimum:  ?	Proposed land use and acreage of land required ?	Full description of how the current land use would be altered to enable use proposed ?	Description of entity which would enter into any ground lease or other arrangement with NASA, including its capabilities and resources to implement the proposed use ?	Identification of minimum lease term required to facilitate planned use ?	Description of how the proposed concept would be compatible with and supportive of NASA?s mission ?	Description of anticipated environmental issues and impacts associated with proposed use ?	Description of the number and types of employees or other personnel that would require frequent access to the property to carry out the proposed operations or activities  E.

<DESC>The need for Naval Integrated Power Systems (IPS) for surface ships and submarines will increase in the coming decades with the increased projected propulsion and ship service power demands for future combatants with advanced sensors and weapons such as railguns and lasers.  The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) has stood up the Electric Ships Office, with the mission of providing smaller, simpler, more affordable, more capable ship?s power systems for all Navy platforms by defining common open architectures, developing common components, and focusing Navy and industry investments.  To meet the need of future ship designs, the Navy is investing in Next Generation Integrated Power System (NGIPS) technology. Additionally, to promote commonality and acquisition efficiency, the Navy plans to implement NGIPS using an Open Architecture Business and Technical model. The NGIPS evolutionary development approach improves on existing IPS Systems, and inserts technologies as they are ready into ship acquisition programs.  The document attached to this announcement is the NGIPS Technology Development Roadmap (Ser 05D/349 dated 30 Nov 2007).  This is intended to be a guide for future investments by the Navy, academia, and the private sector to achieve the vision of implementing NGIPS related technologies. The Navy initiated an effort with the lead surface combatant and submarine shipyards to provide their feasibility and risk assessment of future shipboard electrical system architecture alternatives.  The shipyards developed a report entitled ?Shipyard Team Review of Next Generation Integrated Power System Architectures? (NGIPS/TR-09-07/001).  In order to control access to this document (marked Distribution Statement D - Distribution authorized to the Department of Defense and U.S. DoD contractors only ?

<DESC>The Naval Aviation Systems Command (NAVAIR) has a requirement to modernize Air Combat On Line (ACOL) application for the Air Combat Training System (ACTS).  ACOL is a Learning Management System (LMS) application approved for servers attached to DoD?s Secure Internet Protocol Routing Network (SIPRNET).  NAVAIR has asked the Naval Inventory Control Point (NAVICP) to put ACOL Modernization under contract. The primary objective of the ACOL Modernization effort is to provide ACOL with Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) 2004 conformance while retaining all existing training progress data, as well as the ability for trainees to continue to use existing SCORM 1.2 courses.  The effort envisions several enhancements to capture some of the LMS industry best practices, but such enhancements are only desirable within the limits of affordability.   NAVICP requests information from the LMS industry to facilitate understanding of current industry capabilities and standards to support this effort as outlined below. Parties interested in submitting information shall contact Val Hawthorne, Valerie.hawthorne@navy.mil, Contracting Officer.  NAVICP will utilize an on line communication/collaboration tool called the eProcurement system, to receive input/product brochures, etc.  The Contracting Officer will initiate vendor registration in the eProcuri system to allow access to upload documents.

<DESC>The National Business Center (NBC), Department of the Interior (DOI), is one of four federal payroll providers and one of five federal HR Shared Service Centers (SSC).  The NBC provides personnel action processing and payroll processing to its customers using the Federal Personnel and Payroll System (FPPS).  Currently NBC services to 40 federal agencies using FPPS.  Many of the agencies have contracts with providers of automated staffing solutions such as Avue's "Staffing Module", Monster Government Solutions's "Hiring Management" (also known as QuickHire), and OPM's "USA Staffing".  The NBC intends to implement interfaces between the above systems and the FPPS and any other automated staffing solution currently used by FPPS customers.  NBC will establish an interface from FPPS to the vendor's hosting site. FPPS customers utilize the automated staffing systems based on contracts they have directly with the automated staffing vendors.   The NBC itself does not have direct contract with the automated staffing vendors.  The NBC intends to establish a contractual basis for an interface with each vendor currently hosting an automated staffing solution used by FPPS customers.  The NBC's intent is that automate staffing solution providers interface with FPPS through a standardized interface, rather than through proprietary, vendor unique interfaces.  These interfaces are to be real to near-real time using web services, e.g. SOAP based messaging. A Request for Proposal (RFP) is anticipated to be issued and will include the following requirements::  1.	Proposal for concept of operations. 2.	Vendor's current interface specification 3.	Vendor's current interface technologies 4.	Analysis of differences between the vendor's current interface and the NBC standardized interface 5.	Cost to implement the vendor's end of the standardized interface. 6.	Cost to operate the vendor's end of the standardized interface. Note that acquisition of an automated staffing solution is out of scope for the RFP. In accordance with FAR 15.201- Exchanges With Industry Before Receipt of Proposal, the NBC anticipates holding a pre-solicitation requirements meeting with qualified vendors to review the proposed NBC standardized interface between FPPS and automated staffing solutions.  NBC will provide in advance to qualified vendors the proposed specification for the standardized interface.  In addition to the specification, the NBC will provide information on proposed workflows, events, and triggers between the automated staffing solutions and the FPPS.  NBC will meet separately with each qualified vendor and make modifications to the specification based on the results of the meeting.  The modified specification will become a key component of the requirements in the RFP.  The pre-solicitation meeting will be held in the Washington, DC area the fourth week in February, 2008. The Government has already identified potential vendors as Avue, Monster Government Solutions, and OPM.  In addition, the NBC believes there may be other qualified vendors.  To qualify, a vendor must meet the following criteria: 1) be the developer and supplier of an automated staffing solution; 2) host the automated staffing solution at a vendor location; 3) have a current contract with an FPPS customer agency; 4) and the contract period of performance is current and will be in effect in 2009. Please submit the following information to be considered for invitation to the pre-solicitation meeting: 1.	Name of your company 2.	Name and contact information of the person at your company who will coordinate your participation in the meeting.  3.	Web site URL for company 4.	Name of the Automated Staffing solution you provide to FPPS customers 5.	Location (city, state) where you host the solution for FPPS customers 6.	FPPS Customers to whom you provide the solution must be listed below 7.	For each FPPS customer to whom you provide the automated staffing system provide the: a.	Contract Number b.	Contract Period of Performance c.	Name and contact information of the Contracting Officer  d.	Name and contact information of the Contracting Officer's Representative  Any information provided to NBC may be used to confirm your qualification prior to you receiving an invitation.

<DESC>Sources Sought/Request for Information-Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for Design-Bid-Build (D-B-B) Construction and Design-Build (D-B) Construction, Japan.  This is a market survey for information only, to be used for preliminary planning  purposes.  This is not a solicitation for proposals.  The Government will not pay for any information provided as a result of this market survey.  The U.S. Army Engineer District-Japan is planning to solicit a MATOC for D-B-B and D-B construction to suppo rt U.S. Government facilities in Mainland Japan (excluding Hokkaido) and a separate MATOC for the same services in Okinawa.  ANY SOLICITATIONS PURSUED ARE INTENDED FOR LOCAL SOURCES ONLY.  LOCAL SOURCES ARE THOSE SOURCES NORMALLY RESIDENT AND LICENSED TO C ONDUCT BUSINESS IN JAPAN.  A MATOC is an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract for construction services with multiple awardees.  Actual work is awarded through the issuance of task orders.  Multiple awardees generally compete with each other f or task orders.  There are some exceptions to this rule, whereby competition may be reduced or task orders are issued non-competitively to one contract holder.  The Government anticipates award of up to three contracts under each MATOC to experienced sourc es capable of performing a wide range of D-B-B and D-B construction projects including, but not limited to:  grading, water lines, sewer lines, paving/repaving roadways, painting, roofing, renovation of interiors of existing buildings, new building constru ction, structural construction, Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems and components, refrigeration systems, fire suppression systems, fuel pipeline and storage systems, power and services supplies, distribution and utilization systems (including lighting), power generators and Uninterrupted Power Supplies (UPS), public address systems, fire alarm systems, telephone systems, asbestos, lead based paint, and petroleum-contaminated material abatement and disposal.  Work historically (within  the last two years) performed under the Mainland Japan MATOC generally fall under the category of maintenance and repair.  Very few projects are termed new construction or are considered construction as defined by the type of work performed.  Although the  scope of work for these repair/maintenance projects may typically vary from year to year, specific types of work executed on Mainland Japan included:  32,400,000 YEN to replace domestic water distribution systems for multiple buildings - included replacem ent of underground primary water laterals up to existing fixtures in multiple-story facilities, demolition and capping of existing water lines, trenching, and pipe/valve installation;  64,800,000 YEN to replace an existing rooftop hospital cooling tower; 3 2,400,000 YEN to replace a medical clinic HVAC system; 21,600,000 YEN to repair and upgrade existing family housing playgrounds; 756,000,000 YEN to construct an unsheltered site (hardstands and steel structures) in order to situate various mechanical/elect rical equipment and administration and maintenance facilities - included earth berm construction, site and utility work, security shelters, road work and area lighting; 972,000,000 YEN to repair and upgrade multiple transient lodging facilities to current standards  included interior renovations to living areas, baths, kitchenettes, various common use areas, and exterior work including roof and HVAC replacement, fire protection system upgrade, and security lighting installation; 140,000,000 YEN to construc t a single story administration/operational facility with associated site work (fencing, driveway, concrete pads); and 21,600,000 YEN to replace existing fluorescent ceiling mounted lighting fixtures in various hospital areas as an energy savings initiativ e.  Work was performed on various U.S. Military Installations including Camp Zama, Yokota Air Base, Misawa Air Base, and Yokosuka Naval Air Base.  Historical da ta for the Okinawa MATOC include various categories of work with the following ranges:  25,700,000  196,000,000 YEN for boilers, tanks, etc.; 2,500,000  130,000,000 YEN for HVAC repairs and installation; 4,500,000  96,900,000 YEN for civil works; 19,000 ,000  34,700,000 YEN for asbestos/lead paint abatement; 14,800,000  701,000,000 YEN for other new construction (multi-discipline); and 2,000,000  342,000,000 YEN for other maintenance/repair/renovation (multi-discipline). Each MATOC will consist of a on e-year base period and three (3) one-year option periods.  The total maximum amount the Government will order under all three contracts combined is the not-to-exceed-amount of 1,620,000,000 Japanese YEN per period.  The guaranteed minimum amount for each c ontracts base period and each option period exercised is 540,000 Japanese YEN.  A performance bond will be required for individual task orders that are over the Japanese YEN equivalent of $100,000.  Therefore, the Government intends to require contractors  to demonstrate bonding capacity of 1,620,000,000 Japanese YEN.  The minimum task order amount is 2,700,000 Japanese YEN.  The maximum task order amount is 810,000,000 Japanese YEN.  Task orders issued under these contracts will be D-B-B or D-B in nature.  For D-B-B task orders, the Government will provide the contractor with full design.  For D-B task orders, contractor may be required to produce engineering designs ranging from shop-drawings to full designs in accordance with Unified Facilities Guide Spec ifications (UFGS) depending on the complexity of the task order.  The Government will provide the contractor with a project scope varying from a general scope of work with no drawings to a complete statement of work with design up to 90 percent.  Contracto r designs will be conducted after award of a task order in accordance with both U.S. and Japanese design standards.  Task order award will generally be based on any one, or combination of the following criteria, with weights to be stated in each task order  request for proposal:  A.  Proposed price; B.  Proposed schedule; C.  Proposed technical details/solution; D.  Past performance; and E.  Innovation proposed in design.  After review of the information provided above, all interested contractors are request ed to furnish comments on the following topics:  A.  Appropriateness of the minimum task order amount; B.  Appropriateness of the minimum guaranteed amount; C.  Interest in the solicitation based on the maximum not-to-exceed contract amount; D.  Bonding ca pability; E.  Your ability to work in the diverse, multiple regions covered by either proposed solicitation; F.  Based on the information provided, do you foresee any barriers that will prevent or discourage your firm from participating in the solicitation ?; and G.  Other comments.

This Notice is solely for the Government's use as a market research tool.  As such, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is not guaranteed.  If determined appropriate, then both a synopsis and a solicitation may be anticipated in the March-April 2008 timeframe.  All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this Notice.  All information received will be considered.  Failure to respond to this Notice does not preclude a firm from offering on any resultant solicitation; however, a lack of interest in this requirement may keep this effort from moving forward competitively.  

This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of an award.  The Government is not bound to make any awards under this Notice.

If you are interested in this project, please provide the information requested above to the DESC Contracting Office.

Installation Description

The electric distribution system being privatized is described as follows: 

Tyndall AFB purchases electricity from the Gulf Power Company (GPC).   The power is delivered through a Gulf Power owned electrical substation on the west end of the base near the hospital.  Power enters the Gulf Power substation by two 46 kV lines.  The Gulf Power substation steps the voltage down to the 12.47 kV distribution level. Each of the 46 KV lines capable of carrying 25 MW and installed in 1961, feed two separate transformers 20 MVA.  Both transformers at the Gulf Power substation serve Tyndall AFB.  In addition, Gulf Power owns approximately 52,400 Single Conductor Linear Feet (SCLF) of wire and 46 transformers associated with the Capehart feeder located in Bay View and School. 

The Gulf Power transformers supply power to four (4) Bays located within the Gulf Power substation.  Each of the four Bays has a vacuum circuit breaker and three regulators per phase.  The power is then distributed over the government owned distribution system by six radial distribution feeders.  Bay #1 has Wherry and Mississippi feeders, Bay #2 has Suwannee feeder, Bay #3 has Hospital and Capehart housing feeders, and Bay #4 Flight-Line feeder.   The electric system in the Bayview MFH area is owned by Gulf Power.

The nominal distribution system voltage is 12.47 kV grounded wye.  All of the government owned feeders at Tyndall AFB are operated as radial feeders with predominantly overhead construction using wood poles.  The backbone phase conductor size used leaving the substation on all these feeders is 4/0 copper.  However, there are generally a variety of conductor sizes used throughout the distribution system.  Most of the overhead conductors are copper, but aluminum conductors have been used in some portions of the system.

Tyndall AFB electrical distribution system consists of approximately 2,511,828 SCLF primary and secondary conductor.  The system is approximately 87.1% overhead and 12.9% underground construction.  The voltage is transformed down to the secondary utilization voltages at the load centers.  
  
The natural gas distribution system being privatized is described as follows: 

Natural gas is supplied to the base via the Defense Energy Supply Center (DESC) contract and delivered to the base via Florida Gas Transmission (FGT) pipelines with local transmission by TECO Peoples Gas.  A single six-inch pipeline enters the base near the south side of the Dupont Bridge across the bay from Panama City and provides gas service for the entire base.  Service is supplied to the base at a pressure of 120 pounds per square inch gauge (psig), and distributed at approximately 55 psig.  The gas main passes through a regulator and valve station at the south end of the Dupont Bridge and all equipment after the regulator is owned, operated and maintained by Tyndall AFB.

The gas is distributed to the main base and two MFH areas (Wood Manor, and Felix Lake) on base through approximately 31 miles of underground pipelines.  The Shoal Point and Bayview MFH areas do not have natural gas distribution service. These lines are the property of the Air Force.  Most of these lines are steel (approximately 70 % of base total).  In some areas where it was necessary to replace lines due to new construction or repair, polyethylene pipe has been installed in place of steel (approximately 30% of base total).  The steel system average age is 40 to 45 years.  There is no tracer wire, marker tape or cathodic protection installed.  The average depth of burial is 36?.  The commodity supplier provides and maintains odorization for the system. 

TECO Peoples Gas meters the natural gas to the base at the fenced regulator station in front of building 5013 (Dupont Bridge).  There are approximately fifty-five additional secondary meters on base that are read, maintained and owned by the Air Force.  The contractor is responsible for monitoring, repairing and maintaining all gas meters.
The water distribution system being privatized is described as follows: 

The water system being privatized is described as follows:  Tyndall AFB normally purchases all potable water for the main base complex from Bay County Utilities Department (Bay County).  In addition, there are six remote on-base sites that utilize their own wells.

Water from Bay County, for use by the base, enters the Tyndall AFB area at the Dupont Bridge, utilizing a single pipeline that feeds into the Bay County 5,000,000 gallon storage tank located northeast of Tyndall school across US Hwy 98.  The primary Bay County pump station then pumps to three distribution points along US Hwy 98 that connect to the Tyndall distribution system.  Delivered water pressure by Bay County averages about 70 psig; a pressure relief valve is installed at the master meters.  Pressures on base range from about 50 to 55 psig.  Three elevated storage tanks serve the main base for emergency use for fire protection should the main pump station fail.

Water is distributed throughout the main base through underground pipelines, ranging in size from 6 to 16 inches for the primary distribution system; in addition, there are smaller distribution lines and service lines to buildings and other facilities.  The original system was installed in the early 1940's using well water as the source, and upgrades and replacements have been added as the area expanded over the years.  There is no tracer wire, marker tape or cathodic protection installed on the system.  The average depth of burial is 36".

There are four backup wells on the main base, available only for emergency use.  These wells are connected to the primary distribution system and are flushed monthly, but are not currently permitted for use by the State.  However, consumptive use permits have been issued by the Northwest Florida Water Management Agency (NWFWMA) for emergency use only.  The backup wells are not included with the sale of the system.  The utility privatization contractor will be required to maintain the wells and operate them during emergency situations as part of a continuing service agreement.  Emergency operation requirements are described in Tyndall AFB Contingency Response Plan 702.

Tyndall AFB receives water from Bay County through its 5,000,000 gallon storage tank and has no operational water treatment facilities for the main base complex.  (Facility 909 was originally a water treatment plant, but is no longer operational and is not part of this solicitation.)  Water for fire protection is provided primarily by the potable water system.  There are also two deluge pumping stations, dedicated for fire protection; however, these are not included as part of the water system with respect to potential utility privatization.

The water system limits for privatization are from the master meter stations to building connections, including the building service lines.  Bay County maintains the master water meters and meter vault; however, the second vault containing the check valve pressure reduction valves are maintained by the Air Force and should be considered as part of the privatization process.  There are a total of three master meter (meters belonging to Bay County) connections along US Highway 98.  Point of demarcation for each will be at the outlet of the master meter box.

There are 25 secondary meters on base that are read, maintained and owned by the Air Force.  Meters that are found on site and that are not identified in table 5 and meters that are added as a result of new construction shall become the property of the contractor.  The contractor is responsible for monitoring, repairing and maintaining all water meters.  

The six remote on-base sites with well water systems are: Silver Flag; Wright Laboratories; Full-Scale Drone; Sub-Scale Drone; Alert Area; and Ammo Area.  Each site has one well, and the wells are permitted by the NWFWMA.  Chlorination is provided by a chlorine gas system at Silver Flag, and by a hypochlorite feed system at each of the other five sites.  A vertical turbine well pump is used at Silver Flag; submersible well pumps are used at the other five sites.  Silver Flag has a 150,000 gallon elevated tank, and the other five sites each utilize a small hydropneumatic tank for storage. Silver Flag is served by a single well with a 150-gallom per minute (gpm) pump.  The chlorination system uses chlorine gas and facilities include a Wallace & Tiernan V-100 chlorinator, chlorine booster pump and chlorine gas detector.  Point of use reverse osmosis systems are used at several of these sites, including Silver Flag, Wright Laboratories, Sky Ten test area and the ammo storage area.  To meet state requirements for removal of all wells, these sites will require connection to a permanent water source.  Bay County has installed a new water line feeding the City of Mexico Beach just a few miles southeast of Tyndall.  Tyndall AFB will require the Contractor to pursue its "best efforts" to assure that all these sites will be connected to the Bay County line and the wells put on stand-by for emergency use only.  Contractor will be required to work with Bay County to get these connections made.

The wastewater collection system being privatized is described as follows: 

	The wastewater system being privatized is described as follows:  Tyndall AFB sanitary sewer is connected to the Bay County Advanced Wastewater Treatment Facility (BCAWWTF) located north of Tyndall AFB.  Sewer system shall be maintained IAW the requirements of the government contract with Bay County Utilities Department (Bay County) for the treatment of Tyndall sewage.  The Bay County treatment facility is located on Tyndall AFB at the end of Boy Scout Road. 
	All wastewater on base (except military family housing) is collected and pumped into the primary wet well at the old-Wastewater Treatment Plant (old-WWTP).  The old-WWTP is non-operational for treatment; however, select components are used to facilitate collection and pumping of wastewater to the BCAWWTF.  The Pump House (Bldg 1722), Valve Control Facility (Bldg 1723), wet well, clarifiers, and primary force mains are Government owned.  These facilities collect and transport wastewater from Tyndall AFB and the City of Mexico Beach to the BCAWWTF.  The Bay County force main from the City of Mexico Beach also flows through the old-WWTP area to the wet well.  The two clarifiers at the old-WWTP are designated as holding tanks in case of emergency overflow.  There is no tracer wire, marker tape or cathodic protection installed on the system from Wood Manor, Redfish and Felix Lake.  The system average depth of burial is 42 inches.    
Housing sewage is collected through lift station facility 2873 and pumped to the BCAWWTF.  The force main ties into the primary force main along Boy Scout road.

<DESC>The purpose of this sources sought is to identify potential sources capable of being developed as a second source for manufacturing Light Weight (LW) 30x113MM M789 High Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP) cartridges, NSN 1305-01-268-9373, Part No. 12902728 .  Special equipment is required to produce these cartridges.  The manufacturing process encompasses, but is not limited to: (1) machining of projectile body, fuze, and copper liner metal parts, (2)fuze production, (3) production of propellant, (4) cartrid ge case priming and loading with propellant and (5) load, assemble, and pack-out (LAP) of the completed cartridges. The LAP for M789 cartridges requires highly specialized facilities, equipment, and tooling for the safe storage, handling, transportation, w eighing, consolidation and testing of high explosives and fuzes. In most cases the production processes dealing with high explosives and fuzes must be performed remotely. The facilities must be specially designed and fabricated to meet DOD hazard/safety st andoff requirement in order to mitigate the risk of propagation in the event of an unintended initiation of explosive materials. Additionally the LAP personnel must be specially trained to work with explosives. For each step of the manufacturing process, s ophisticated test and measuring equipment is required to ensure the final products comply with Government requirements.  Process engineering experience relative to the LAP of these cartridges is essential.  An approved ballistics test range, M230 MANN barr els and M230 Automatic Gun are required to perform First Article and Lot Acceptance Tests on these cartridges.  Production support equipment includes material handling systems, tool room equipment, furnaces for heat treat and annealing, metal forming and m achining equipment, anodize and phosphate systems, ultrasonic test equipment and metrology and metallurgy laboratories.  Production of the cartridge is very complex and requires sophisticated industrial capabilities.  Critical skills required to manufactur e the M789 include, but are not limited to ammunition process/design engineers, explosive experts, set-up mechanics and operators familiar with the programming and operation of ammunition component sub-assembly production equipment, quality control enginee rs, ultra sonic technicians, metallurgists and ballistics test personnel.  The skills needed to manufacture and provide high quality ammunition will need to be obtained in a timely manner in order to meet the customers requirements.  Due to the customers  demand for these cartridges, interested parties must be able to successfully complete a First Article Acceptance Test and deliver first production quantities within 20 months from the date of contract award.  Additionally, a respondents production capaci ty must be sufficient to manufacture an average of 30,000 cartridges per month based on a 1-8-5 shift schedule.  Interested US/Canadian firms who feel they are capable of manufacturing the M789 cartridge are invited to indicate their interest by providing the Government a brief summary of their companys capabilities, facilities, personnel and past manufacturing experience to: Headquarters, Army Sustainment Command, ATTN: AMSAS-ACA-F/Amy VanSickle, 1 Rock Island Arsenal, Rock Island, IL  61299-6500, or elec tronically to amy.vansickle@us.army.mil.  Please respond no later than February 25, 2008, and identity the 30MM M789 Second Source, Sources Sought/Market Research as the subject of your response.  This market survey is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Proposed addition of 10% of the Government?s requirement for Flip Style Flash Drives to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.
<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Flip Style Flash Drives by the Federal Government. 
 
The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (P/L).  You can view the P/L on our website at www.jwod.gov.  Once a product is added to the P/L to be performed by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.

The Committee has been asked to consider adding the total Government requirement for the following product to the P/L:

USB Flip Style Flash Drive:
7520-00-NIB-1873 (1 GB, no encryption)
7520-00-NIB-1874 (2 GB, no encryption)
7520-00-NIB-1875 (4 GB, no encryption)
7520-00-NIB-1974 (8 GB, no encryption)
7520-00-NIB-1877 (1 GB, w/encryption)
7520-00-NIB-1878 (2 GB, w/encryption)
7520-00-NIB-1879 (4 GB, w/encryption)
7520-00-NIB-1976 (8 GB, w/encryption)

The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration, Region 2, New York, NY.
  
Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Flip Style Flash Drives to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.

In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:  

1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period

2) Revenues accrued by providing Flip Style Flash Drives to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period 

3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.  

The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than February 27, 2008 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the P/L.

It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to
(703) 603-0030.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.

When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.

General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.jwod.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the P/L, please contact Ms. Connie Mehr at (703) 603-2116.

Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Business Size Shredders to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are:

FEL 38420 ? Model 420SC
OBY 1500 ? Olympia Paper Shredder HD Strip Cut
GBC 1757340 ? GBC Paper Shredder HD Strip Cut

In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:  

1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period

2) Revenues accrued by providing Business Size Shredders to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period 

3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.  

The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than February 27, 2008 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the P/L.

It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to
(703) 603-0030.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.

When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.

The objective of this TRE is to independently evaluate advanced biological detector (trigger) and collector technologies for potential transition to the Joint Biological Tactical Detector System (JBTDS).  The Joint Biologic al Defense Program is seeking detectors and collectors as well as combined detector/collector technologies that are lightweight, man-portable, battery operable, automated, and whose technologies are suitable for field application.   Vendors both domestic a nd international are requested to respond to this opportunity as detailed in Parts I, II and III that follow.<BR><BR>This announcement consists of three (3) parts:  Part I - Background and Description, Part II - Technical Criteria and Testing, and Part III   Submission of Information.<BR> <BR>PART I- Background and Description.<BR>Technology Readiness Evaluation (TRE) 08-2 is scheduled to start in June/July 2008 for approximately six (6) to eight (8) weeks.  Plans are to conduct the TRE at a location to be determined (TBD).  The Government will perform all aerosol detector and collector testing with invited vendor systems that meet the nominal performance criteria detailed in Part II.

Since that time, under the terms of FAR clause  52.244-2, the contracting officer has not permitted the CAPS contract  holders to add subcontractors other than those proposed and evaluated  during source selection.  Now, however, the contracting officer has  determined that it is appropriate to allow each CAPS prime contractor an  opportunity to add subcontractor team members.  The purpose of this  posting is to make the contractor community aware of this subcontracting  opportunity. The basic contract Performance Work Statement (PWS) and Labor Categories  document (which identifies the education and experience levels pertaining  to each of the labor categories covered by the CAPS contract) are provided  to enable potential subcontractors to determine how their capabilities  correspond to the overall CAPS requirements. The CAPS prime contractors currently eligible to compete for task orders  are: BTAS INC. THE CENTECH GROUP, INC. INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION LOGTEC, INC. MADISON RESEARCH CORPORATION MCR FEDERAL, LLC P E SYSTEMS INC. SUMARIA SYSTEMS, INC. TYBRIN CORPORATION ANY INQUIRIES REGARDING SUBCONTRACTING POSSIBILITIES MUST BE COMMUNICATED  TO THE PRIME CONTRACTORS LISTED ABOVE.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT ASC/PKWD  REGARDING SUBCONTRACTING POSSIBILITIES UNDER CAPS. For more information on "Notice of Subcontracting Opportunities on CAPS",  please refer to:  https://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/pixs_solicitation.asp?id=5530

<DESC>Background and Need:   This project seeks to characterize the effectiveness of a comprehensive preventive program in preventing beryllium sensitization and chronic beryllium disease (CBD) among beryllium-exposed workers. Exposure to beryllium can lead to sensitization and cause an immunologic granulomatous lung disease. Sensitized workers often have or develop CBD, but it is not presently known whether all of them will develop disease.

Project Objective:   This project will offer study participants the beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test (BeLPT) to detect sensitization. Each participant?s blood sample will be split and sent to two independent laboratories for processing.

Scope of Work:  Each contractor shall perform a valid laboratory screening blood test, beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test. We estimate 450 - 600 tests to be performed by each laboratory between 03/01/2008 and 02/28/ 2010.  We have also included an option year for 600 additional tests should they be necessary.  They Government may or may not exercise the option.

<DESC>The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy Colorado, intends to award a sole source commercial contract to Bentley Systems, Inc.   This sole source acquisition is in accordance with FAR 6.302-1. The requirement is to purchase MicroStation and ProjectWise software.

Bentley Systems, Inc. is the only source that can satisfy the government?s requirements.  The North America Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 511210 and the size standard is $23 million.  This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals.     

Any company that feels they can provide the maintenance must submit their technical data (2 pages or less) to support their claim no later than 1 February 2008, 12:00 PM, MDT.

<DESC>OPM has delegated the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) authority to conduct personnel security background investigations on ATF applicants, contractors, and other non-ATF personnel, as well as periodic reinvestigations on all current employees.   The purpose of these investigations is to determine suitability for employment and/or eligibility to access National Security Information.  Background investigations are conducted in accordance with established Executive Orders 10450 and 12968, the Privacy Act of 1974, Office of Personnel Management regulations, other relevant regulations from the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and ATF policies and procedures.  ATF will provide these regulations to the Contractor.

ATF has established a contract background investigation program to contract these investigations out to trained and experienced investigators.  Operational and administration aspects of the program are also contracted out to trained and experienced investigators or personnel security professionals, typically, though not exclusively, retired federal investigators who have at least 3 years of current experience in the administration of and/or conduct of personnel security background investigations.  Contractors must possess sufficient investigative and administrative abilities to perform the tasks assigned to them by ATF.

Contractors must be computer literate and efficient in software programs that support email, word processing, and data entry, which are utilized in the administration of the personnel security program.

Contractors' duties and work hours are dictated by the ATF workload and funding availability.  Contractors are expected to be available to accept work as requested.  Contractors will be paid at the rate of $54.50 per hour.  Internal reviews of Contractor performance are conducted on a quarterly basis.  

In compliance with ATF's specific invoicing procedures, Contractors must submit an invoice for payment detailing the number of hours worked.  Such invoice will be subject to audit by ATF. Contractors must also execute a Contractor Certification that declares that any submission of a Contractor's invoice represents actual hours performed in accordance with requirements of the Statement of Work. 

ATF may use the services of a third party contractor to provide administrative records and financial management services.  This includes processing invoices and making payments for ATF designated contracts such as those for conducting background investigations.  Consequently contractors are advised that the third party, rather than ATF, may provide actual payment for services rendered and accepted by ATF under any resulting contract.  Contractors are further advised that the third party is required to make payments in the same timely manner as ATF.  

Contractors must be willing to attend periodic conferences at selected locations within the United States.  Conferences are usually limited to one per year.  

Contractors will have access to ATF's computer network and will sign ATF P 7500.1, ATF Rules of Behavior and Customer Agreement for ATF Workstation Users.  Contractors are required to successfully complete ATF Information System Security Awareness training each year.

Contractors shall submit to the performance of a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI).  Favorable adjudication of the SSBI must be determined by ATF prior to access to ATF facilities and information.  ATF will conduct an SSBI-Periodic Reinvestigation on contract investigators every five years.

Contractors must execute, and abide by the terms of a Non-Disclosure Agreement.  

Contractors must obtain a Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) number and have a current registration in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) for payment via electronic funds transfer. 

ATF intends to issue vendors Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) that will be available for placing calls/orders through September 30, 2010.  The solicitation will close February 15, 2008 at 4 p.m. EST.  All responses will be evaluated and a sufficient number of awards will be made to the most advantageous (most highly rated) contractors.  A BPA will be awarded after all evaluations are passed, tentative selections are made, interviews completed and background investigations adjudicated favorably.  Because ATF's needs are dynamic, ATF anticipates a requirement to periodically re-open this solicitation add new contractors to the pool.  

Vendors selected from their responses to this solicitation will be offered a BPA.  A BPA is not a contract.  A BPA is a simplified method of procuring quantities of supplies or services that selected vendors are in a position to furnish and eliminates the need for more complex acquisition methods.  There will be no minimum or maximum guaranteed quantity.  All calls/orders must be acknowledged and accepted by the selected vendor, or the call will be transferred to another vendor.  Calls/orders may be competed among all vendors at the same time, upon the discretion of the ATF representative.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 561611 Investigation Services, and is the appropriate designation required by the CCR.

The following clauses are incorporated in full force:  FAR Part 52.212.1 Instructions to Offeror ? Commercial Items (Oct. 00)  and FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial (incorporated by reference)  Each Offeror shall include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items;  A copy of the Offeror Representations and Certifications- can be found on the web at www.arnet.gov/far.

EVALUATION AND SELECTION CRITERIA.

Capability of the Vendor.

ATF will consider BPAs to vendors, as needed, on a pass/fail basis, based on past performance and experience, and the vendor's acceptability (the acceptance of ATF terms and conditions including the hourly rate).  All vendors must submit complete responses, must be able to obtain a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation and must be willing and able to obtain a Dun and Bradstreet number and register with the Central Contractor Registration.  These are mandatory requirements and any firm will be eliminated that fails to comply.  Vendors will be initially screened on a pass/fail basis for acceptability.  Vendors rated as passed will be awarded points for past performance and experience.  Vendors with an overall score of at least 85 points and that meet the mandatory requirements will be considered for issuance of a BPA and award will be made to those companies receiving the highest scores.  At least 45 points must come from Offeror Demonstrated Experience/Qualifications/Past Performance and 40 must come from Vendor Capabilities.

a.  Experience/Qualifications/Past Performance (65 Points):  Experience is the opportunity to learn by doing.  A minimum of three years combined experience as either a personnel security specialist or an investigator conducting personnel security background investigations is recommended.  ATF will evaluate each vendor's experience on the basis of its breadth, depth, and relevance to the work that will be required under the prospective BPA. Evaluators will consider the years of experience conducting and/or administering personnel security background investigations in the federal environment, as well as computer proficiency.  ATF may assess the vendor?s communication and written skills, and familiarity with directives governing the conduct of background investigations through an interview. (45 points minimum).

b.  Capabilities (45 Points):  Past performance is a measure of the degree to which a vendor satisfied its customers in the past and complied with laws and regulations.  ATF may contact some of the vendor's customers to ask whether or not they believe (1) that the vendor was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) that the vendor's performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (3) that the vendor was reasonable and cooperative during the performance; and (4) that the vendor was committed to customer satisfaction.  In evaluating past performance, ATF may contact some of the references provided by the vendor and other sources of information, including, but not limited to:  other government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic databases. (40 points minimum).

Contractors with recent ATF experience will be evaluated on the performance they provided to ATF.  ATF will consider performance that contractors have previously rendered to ATF to be more influential than past performance rendered to another source.

c.  Acceptability.  ATF will determine the acceptability of each vendor offer on a pass or fail basis.  A vendor's offer is acceptable when it manifests the vendor's assent, without exception, to the terms and conditions of the solicitation, including attachments and amendments (if any).  If a vendor takes exception to any of the terms and conditions of the scope of work, ATF will consider its offer to be unacceptable.  Vendors wishing to take exception to the terms and conditions stated are strongly encouraged to contact the Contracting Officer before doing so.

Proposal Format and Submission Instructions
Deadline for Receipt of Proposals is 5:00pm EST February 14, 2008.   Offerors assume full responsibility for ensuring that their proposals are received by the due date and time. Each proposal shall consist of two volumes:

Volume I Technical Capability, electronic or original to include all data and information required for evaluation (please refer to the Evaluation Factors below for more detail for what constitutes the required data and information).  Moreover, Volume I shall not contain any reference to price.
	Factor I: Technical Approach
	Factor II: Past Performance

Volume II - Price Proposal, electronic or original to include the completed solicitation documents and a complete and detailed price breakdown with all supporting information requested in the Price Breakdown portion of this solicitation.  Price evaluation will be conducted on each of the phases to determine price fair and reasonableness.

General Information ? Submission of Proposals (Best Value)
Offerors are cautioned that the quality of their proposal and adherence to solicitation response requirements and/or restrictions are considered reflective of the manner in which the Offeror could be expected to provide a data audit tool solution and will be given due consideration throughout the evaluation process.  Offerors are cautioned that failure to provide all the required information may make the offer unacceptable and may result in elimination of the Offeror from further consideration award.

Volume I submissions are limited to the maximum number of pages in length of 25.  Responses to Attachment A & B benchmarks are also included in this page limitation.  Each "page" is defined as one sheet, 8 ?" x 11", with at least one inch margins on all sides, using a font with a point size of 12 points or greater with no more than 15 characters per inch (e.g. ?Times New Roman? style with 12 point font).

The cover sheet, table of contents (not to exceed one page per volume), tabs, and dividers will not count toward the page limit. The price proposal (Volume II) is not page limited.  However, the price proposal is to be strictly limited to cost and price information.  

Evaluation Factors
The OCC will use the following factors to evaluate proposals in accordance with FAR 12.203 and FAR 15.304.  Technical capability is more important than past performance, but when combined technical capability and past performance are significantly more important than price.

1.	 Technical Capability

Technical capability ensures that the vendor is capable of fulfilling the OCC?s solicitation requirements.  The OCC?s assessment of technical capability will focus on the vendor?s ability to meet the technical requirements provided in this RFQ.  Vendors must address each benchmark listed in Attachments A & B.  When addressing the benchmarks, vendors must answer ?yes? or ?no? as to whether they meet each benchmark.  For every benchmark where vendor answers ?yes,? vendor must provide a detailed explanation of how their tool satisfies this requirement, including rule name, SQL statement, etc?

Vendors who are selected as part of the competitive range will be required to demo their product in the OCC environment for a one month period to document and verify the solution?s conformance with technical requirements as well as the benchmarks provided in Attachments A & B.  A final rating will be given to Vendors? technical solution at the end of the demo period, which will be considered, along with their final proposal, in the evaluation of technical capability.

2.	 Past Performance

For offerors without a record of relevant past performance, they shall not be rated favorably or unfavorably on past performance pursuant to FAR 15.305.

Offerors shall describe its past or current performance for three contracts.  Past performance should include similar scope, magnitude and complexity to that which meets to general details as provided for within the solicitation.  Offerors who present similar contracts should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contracts to the requirements of the solicitation.  The offeror should provide the following information regarding its past performance:

a) Contract Number(s);
b) Name and phone number of a point of contact at the Federal, State, Local Government or commercial entity for which the contract was performed;  
c) Dollar value of the Contract;
d) Detailed description of the work performed;
e) Names of subcontractor(s) used, if any and a description of the extent of work   performed by the subcontractor(s); and
f) The number, type and severity of any quality, delivery or cost problems in performing the contract, the corrective action taken and the effectiveness of the corrective action.

3. 	Price

Volume II, Containing the pricing for the hardware and software solution listed under the Cost Schedule, will be the basis for price evaluation.

Determination of Best Value

The Government will make an award to the responsible offeror whose responsive proposal represents the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered, in accordance with the evaluation criteria below. The best value tradeoff process described in FAR 15.101 -1 permits tradeoffs among price and non-price factors and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced proposal or the highest technically rated proposal. 

To be responsive the offeror must address all the requirements of the solicitation and must include all information specifically required in all sections of the solicitation. The offeror must state how it will meet the requirements; repeating back the words of the RFP or responding with product sales literature is not acceptable. 

The Government intends to conduct discussions.  The CO will establish a competitive range of the most highly rated proposals.  If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.  Discussions will be conducted with those vendors within the competitive range pursuant to FAR 15.306.

The failure of an Offeror's proposal to meet any given requirement of the RFP may result in the entire proposal being found to be unacceptable and thus eliminated from the competition.  The realism of rates will be part of the proposal evaluation.  Unrealistic rates and pricing solutions, as determined by the Contracting Officer, will be considered in the risk assessment and may result in a reduced score.  OCC will award a contract to the Offeror of a proposal that is judged, by an integrated assessment of all of the evaluation factors, to be the best value to the Government.

Bentley Systems, Inc. is the only source that can satisfy the government?s requirements.  The North America Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 511210 and the size standard is $23 million.  This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals.

MEMORANDUM FOR PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS

FROM: 355 CONS/MSCAB

Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona 85707-3522

SUBJECT: Minutes of Preproposal Conference/Site Visit, Solicitation FA4877-08-Q0168, Seasonal Maintenance of Evaporative Coolers

1. A Preproposal Conference/Site Visit was held on 1 Feb 08 at 0900, at building 2525, 355th  Contracting Squadron. The following individuals attended the meeting:

Arthur Perry             355 CONS/MSCAB          Contract Administrator     (520) 228-2213
David Konkol            355 CES/CEOBH            Chief, HVAC Shop       (520) 228-3139
TSgt Chris Steinbacher     355 CES/CEOE              Quality Assurance Evaluator (520) 228-1446
Ken Bedient             Advantage Air                Vendor                (520) 792-1200
Kevin Bedient            Advantage Air                Vendor                (520) 792-1200
Dennis Igou              Perfect Temperature            Vendor               (520) 904-0841
Cary Ogden              Pro Tec Refrigeration           Vendor               (602) 222-9881
Steven Zorz              Pro Tec Refrigeration           Vendor              (602) 222-9881
Jayson Wagner           Andrew's Refrigeration           Vendor              (602) 725-0738
Carl Bundy              Andrew's Refrigeration           Vendor              (602) 992-9560

2. The vendors were taken to two facilities and shown a number of rooftop units. Mr. Konkol stated that, while external fixed ladders and/or internal stairs provide access to all rooftop units, base shops personnel have found that using their own ladders when possible affords the easiest, most efficient access. When asked, Mr. Konkol estimated that over half of the units to be serviced are at ground level.

3. Mr. Konkol pointed out that a number of newly installed units are not part of this requirement. He urged the contractor to check with the QAE prior to servicing a given unit if there is any doubt whether it is part of the contract. Mr. Konkol and Mr. Perry both used this opportunity to stress that regular communication between the contractor and the QAE will be critical to the success of this effort.

4. Mr. Konkol pointed out that several of the facilities listed are on the flightline, hence the PWS reference to required flightline drivers training (paragraph 1.10); however, all cooler units are near the fence separating the flightline from the rest of the base. This fence has personnel access gates located at intervals, obviating the need to drive on the flightline, if the contractor chooses to use the gates.

5. A question concerning required repairs not listed at PWS paragraph 1.2 was resolved by a decision to include a separate category of work by adding revised paragraph 1.7. "Incidental Work," to the PWS. Incidental work is to be negotiated individually, on a case-by-case basis prior to work being accomplished. It will be reimbursed at a labor hour rate to be included in each offeror's quote.

6. Another question concerned budgeting time for replacement of major parts, such as motors, pumps, bearings, etc. This work should be included in the offeror's per-unit price. It will not be separately reimbursed. An estimate of required replacements is included as an attachment. NOTE: This is a best-guess estimate only--it is not based on historical data.

7. Mr. Perry stated that a staging area will be provided; however, security will be the contractor's responsibility. The contractor may erect temporary fencing or it may place a mobile storage container at the site.

8. Following the tour, Mr. Perry solicited further questions and comments from the attendees. He stressed that this is a best value acquisition, with source selection to be based on a price/past performance tradeoff. In other words, vendor references will be polled to ascertain customer satisfaction, and the results will used in conjunction with offer prices to determine the best overall value to the Government. Thus, it is possible that the lowest price quote will not receive the award. It is also possible that the highest-rated (from a customer satisfaction perspective) quote will not receive award. Price and past performance will both factor into our decision.

9. Mr. Perry reiterated the necessity for all quotes to include certification that the offeror meets the small-business size standard noted in the synopsis/solicitation, either by completing the "Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA)," at https://orca.bpn.gov/, or by including a completed copy of FAR 52.212-3, "Offeror Representations and Certifications?Commercial Items," which can be found at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm.

10. Mr. Perry also stated that the Government has a requirement for annual cooler service. We are planning a long-term acquisition consisting of a base year plus four option years, beginning in the Fall of 2008. Mr. Perry hopes to post a solicitation for this requirement later in the year. He pointed out that the vendor selected for this solicitation would be advantageously positioned to bid on the upcoming requirement, assuming satisfactory performance.

11. The preproposal conference was adjourned at approximately 1030.
