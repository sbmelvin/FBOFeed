The Government intends to award without discussions and requires that an offeror submit their best proposal in response to subject request for proposal (RFP).  The award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best overall value to the Government. Competing proposals will be evaluated against the requirements of the solicitation in order to assess strengths, weaknesses and associated risks, and deficienci es. The non-pricing factors will assign ratings to each using the adjectives of excellent, good, satisfactory, marginal, and unsatisfactory. Risk evaluations will be made based upon the adjective ratings of low risk, medium risk, or high risk. The pricing factor will not be assigned adjective ratings but will have risk assessments made. The tradeoff process of evaluation between non-pricing and pricing aspects of the offerors presentations will be used to determine those offers that should result in award of a contract. Implicit in the Governments evaluation and selection process is its willingness to accept other than the lowest priced offers. Proposals will be reviewed to determine if they contain the required minimum procurement and technical data. Inco mplete proposals may be eliminated. All forms shall be filled in and all requested data must be provided. After compliance review, the SSB will begin evaluating the factors set forth herein. The price/cost proposal information will be evaluated (not scored ) with regard to reasonable and complete pricing.  If necessary, a competitive range may be determined. The competitive range will consist of all proposals which are considered to have a reasonable chance of being selected for award. The Government may rej ect any or all proposals and waive minor informalities or minor irregularities in proposals.  Proposals will be evaluated by an independent Source Selection Board (SSB). The SSB will be composed of Corps of Engineers employees. Identities of Board members are confidential and members will not be available for contact or discussion prior to submissi on of proposals.  All questions must be submitted in writing by 15 July 2005 to email recipients: renee.williams@tac01.usace.army.mil and clyde.hunt@tac01.usace.army.mil. 1.2 EVALUATION FACTORS:  The Management/Technical Proposal categories below correspond to the specified evaluation criteria. They are listed in descending order of importance with Factor 1 the most important and the Factor 3 being the least important. Past performance will be eval uated by contacting references for indications of customer satisfaction and review of performance evaluations provided by the offeror or obtained by the Government. In the event that an offeror does not have a record of past performance, a written explanat ion of the reasons why no record is available is requested. In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. A neutral rating with unknown risk will be assigned  1.3 Management/Technical/Cost Proposal Evaluation Criteria:  Factor 1: OFFEROR EXPERIENCE  The evaluators will rate the contractors demonstrated experience with holding facilities produced in accordance with ACA standards and organization of team member responsibilities and the management of the project.
