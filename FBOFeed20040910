<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for a one-year extension to the Safety and Mission Assurance (S&MA) Mission Services Contract, NAS8-00179, with Hernandez Engineering, Inc. (HEI).	The existing cost-plus-award-fee contract has a period of performance from October 1, 2000, through September 30, 2005.  This one-year action will extend services through September 30, 2006. The services contemplated for the one-year extension fall within the scope of the existing statement of work.  These services include the overall S&MA support to provide the necessary management, personnel, equipment, and supplies to provide mission services associated with the planning, implementation, and assessment of safety, reliability, maintainability, quality assurance, and risk management programs for the MSFC Safety and Mission Assurance Directorate.	The services include the overall S&MA support to the Space Shuttle Program (SSP), the International Space Station (ISS) Program, the Constellation Systems/Exploration Program, the Project Prometheus, to all Government-furnished equipment developed at MSFC, to both SSP and ISS hardware and operations, and to SSP, ISS, and Expendable Launch Vehicle payloads.  The services also include real-time support as required in the MSFC Huntsville Operations Support Center, reviewing in-flight anomalies, and assuring that resolution of anomalies does not violate S&MA requirements and represents a safe course of action for the program(s). NASA/MSFC intends to extend the existing contract with HEI supported by a Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1).  The increased risks associated with HEI and S&MA personnel attempting to support critical Return to Flight (RTF) and re-competition activities at the same time are unacceptable.  Only the incumbent is uniquely situated to satisfy the Government's requirements within this timeframe without increasing program risk to unacceptable levels associated with initiating re-competition activities while critical Space Shuttle RTF activities are ongoing and relying heavily upon the services provided by HEI and S&MA civil servant personnel.  Postponing the re-competition for one year and continuing to obtain support services from HEI during the RTF period will mitigate program risk.  NASA/MSFC has every intention of conducting a Full and Open Competition for the follow-on procurement to this one-year extension. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. See note 22.    Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 25, 2004. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>Description:  SUBJECT: DOE OEA Critical Energy Infrastructure and Assurance: Preparing Local Governments. DESC: The U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA intends to award a purchase order on a sole-source basis to Public Technology Inc., Washington, DC  (PTI) to provide the following: BACKGROUND:  Local government has been dramatically demonstrated to be the first line of response and preparedness for emergency and disaster situations. Deficiencies have been noted within all critical infrastructure areas: energy, transportation, banking, finance, telecommunications, emergency response systems, and water supply.  A common theme among these deficiencies is the lack of adequate information and communication protocols to support effective preparation and response options.  Neither civilian nor military agencies can completely protect the population from the many threats facing the nation, but greater awareness, planning, communication, detection, and prevention can significantly reduce the consequences and expedite the response. The purpose of this proposed project is to aid individual local governments across the United States to implement and participate in DOEâ€™s Office of Energy Assuranceâ€™s Energy Emergency Assurance Coordinator (EEAC) System.  This proposed work plan, geared toward the local government sector, builds on a framework that has already been developed by the Office of Energy Assurance and other organizations representing state energy associations. This work is considered to be sole source to Public Technology Inc. (PTI) because they are a not-for-profit organization founded in 1971, is via charter the technology organization for the National League of Cities (NLC), the National Association of Counties (NACo), and the International City/County Management Association (ICMA).  PTI is unique as being the only national organization dedicated to furthering the use of technology in both cities and counties.  These associations, whose members are the elected and appointed officials of city and county governments, provide PTI with its policy direction.  PTIâ€™s Sustainability Task Force, a one-of-a-kind national network consisting of individuals representing large local governments, will perform the work required by the Department of Energy.  Given PTIâ€™s unique representation of local government officials and traditional areas of focus, it is in the publicâ€™s best interest to use PTI to implement the initiatives of DOEâ€™ s Office of Energy Assurance addressing energy infrastructure reliability and security. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by this agency.  Offerors shall provide sufficient technical literature, documents, etc., in order for the Government evaluation team to make an adequate technical assessment of the quote as meeting technical acceptability.  Therefore, no solicitation will result the announcement. This award shall be made using FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Request for information should be addressed to Mr. Robert L. Mohn, FAX 412-386-5770. The Technical Representative for the above requirement is Mr. Michael Knaggs at 304-285-4926.  All bids, proposals, or quotations must be submitted by 5:00 PM Eastern Time, September 24, 2004.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration intends to negotiate with George Mason University Office of Sponsored Programs 4400 University Drive, MSN 4C6 Fairfax, VA 22030-4444 to provide for a Telework Center for the Department of Commerce/ Economic Development Administration (EDA) Continuity of Operations (Coop) Site B on a sole source basis in accordance with the authority of 41 U. S. C. 253 (c)(1) only one responsible source for a 12-month base period and four 12-month option periods.
 
EDA is required to establish a tier 2, Alternate Site B COOP facility in accordance with the specifications detailed in Presidential Decision Directive (PDD)-67, dated October 21, 1998 and  Federal Preparedness Circular (FPC) 67.  

Th Manassas Telework Center is able to accommodate up to 20 EDA employees within a 11-hour notice of COOP activation.   Its location meets the requirement of Site B COOP relocation sites (i.e., government-owned, readily accessible by autos and trucks, and within established service areas of public utilities and telecommunications providers).  Accommodations include 20 separate seats for each EDA employee, a conference room/meeting room facility, and necessary general-use office equipment (copier, laser printer, fax machine, and shredder).

The Manassas facility has existing technology which mirrors EDA’s technology requirements, including workstations with computer equipment, and telephones with voicemail.  The existing workstations support EDA’s standard Microsoft Windows operating environment, as well as office automation suite components and anti-virus components.  There is no need to re-configure workstation equipment at the Manassas facilities to meet EDA’s COOP requirements.

The Manassas facility currently supports EDA’s standard network operating system environment (Microsoft Windows Server).  The network environment currently supports communication with EDA field offices using the facility’s existing telecommunications.  There is no need to re-configure server equipment at the Manassas facilities to meet EDA’s COOP requirements.

The Manassas facility’s existing technical support staff is familiar with EDA’s requirements and is in a position to immediately support relocated personnel.  There is no requirement to obtain additional expertise on-site, or to re-train existing support staff on EDA’s technical requirements.

The Manassas facility meets all of the physical security requirements required by COOP.  Access to the facility is controlled according to the requirements for Site B COOP relocation facilities, and existing members of EDA’s emergency response team hold badges that allow 24-hour access to the facility.   No additional procedures would need to be implemented to grant the emergency response team access to the facility.

Local accommodations have been identified and are readily available near the Manassas facility that can support both staff and family members impacted by a COOP facilitation requiring relocation of emergency team members.

EDA must continue to have access to a Site B COOP relocation facility to fully comply with Federal and DOC specific requirements for establishing COOP plans.  See note 22.

<DESC>Sources Sought to provide COTS software for a Learning Management System

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is issuing a Sources Sought/Pre-Solicitation Synopsis to seek qualified sources capable of supplying commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software for a Learning Management System.  This procurement will implement the USPTO 21st Century Strategic Plan initiative calling for a certification program to ensure that the U.S. Patent and Trademark employees have the knowledge, skills, and ability to support USPTO goals. The procurement will utilize the newly issued Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG) which is available at http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/. Under PTAG, the USPTO is authorized to limit the number of offerors to achieve maximum reasonable competition. Upon review of the responses to this Sources Sought/Pre-Solicitation Synopsis and if the USPTO determines that it is in the best interests of the USPTO to proceed with an open market acquisition, the USPTO will utilize a two-step streamlined acquisition approach in accordance with PTAG.  Step 1:  Review Capability Statements and downselect to no more than 5 most highly qualified vendors. Step 2:  Issue RFP to the vendors selected from Step 1 and award to the offeror providing the best value. Those vendors who are determined not to be the most qualified will be advised. USPTO may elect to request product demonstrations as part of the follow-on technical evaluation. USPTO may also elect, in accordance with the PTAG, to negotiate only with the most highly rated vendor in Step 2.   THIS PROCUREMENT IS UNRESTRICTED.  IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR STEP 2, INTERESTED VENDORS MUST RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE.  

The USPTO is currently investigating training strategies and establishing USPTO training policies that comply and reflect the President’s Management Agenda, personnel statutes, executive orders, judicial precedents, Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and Department of Commerce (DOC) decisions and directives and USPTO personnel management decisions and directives to design and develop guidelines, systems, and standards for employee career development, training, and occupational career management. 

The technical requirements of the Learning Management System are outlined in Attachment A.

Interested vendors shall submit a capability statement, not to exceed 25 pages that demonstrates the offeror’s qualifications and capability to fulfill the USPTO’s requirements which are outlined in Attachment A.   The capability statement should address the following:  (1) past performance, (2) technical capability and (3) price.  

In determining past performance vendors shall provide customer points of contact, description of the requirement, cost, performance accomplishments and references. In determining technical capability USPTO may test and technically evaluate the proposed systems based on the following factors: security (data encryption and integrity), proven implementation, ease of maintenance, scalability, performance, high availability, component reusability, and compatibility with USPTO architecture.  Specify if software can integrate with IBM WebSphere.  Include benchmarks for each platform supported, including concurrent user statistics, if available.  Multiple approaches are welcomed.  In determining price, vendors will submit price schedules. Ultimate vendor selection will be based upon Best Value as follows: technical and past performance when combined is more important than price.  

Prospective offerors must respond to this Pre-solicitation announcement in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.  Capability statements shall be submitted electronically via email in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat format to hope.smith@uspto.gov no later than September 30, 2004 at 5:00pm.   The USPTO will confirm receipt of all submissions.  Late submissions will not be accepted.

<DESC>FISC Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia intends to procure a Wind Tunnel Under Floor Force Balance, with Calibration and Training, for the United States Naval Academy.  Request for Quotation (RFQ) N00140-04-Q-4204 contemplates a firm fixed price contract.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a 100% Total Small Business Set-Aside.  It is the contractor’s responsibility to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions, which may be accessed in full text at these addresses: www.arnet.gov/far and www.dtic.mil/dfars.  The NAICS code is 423490.   It is requested that qualified sources submit a quote for the following Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs): CLIN 0001: 1 (each) Six Component Wind Tunnel Under Floor Force Balance; CLIN 0002: 1 (lot) Calibration and Training; CLIN 0003: 1 (each) - Shipping.

The Specifications are as follows: The proposed balance shall be of an external configuration design, with six-component measurement capabilities: 3 orthogonal forces (normal, axial, and side forces) and 3 orthogonal moments (rolling, pitching, and yawing moments). The balance/system provided by the supplier must meet or exceed all conditions and specifications stated in the Request for Quotation, meet or exceed all conditions and specifications stated in the suppliers documentation and perform all functions stated in the supplier’s documentation in a satisfactory manner.  The proposed balance shall resolve six load components.  The ranges for the static design loads of the proposed balance are defined as follows: Normal Force (lift) -  Load Magnitude Range:  600 ±50 lbs, Load Offset: -600/+0 lbs; Axial Force (drag) – Load Magnitude Range: 200 ±20 lbs, Load Offset: -200/+0 lbs, Side Force: 600 ±50 lbs, Load Offset:  ±600 lbs; Rolling Moment – Magnitude Range: 250 ±20 ft-lbs, Load Offset:  ±250 ft-lbs; Pitching Moment – Magnitude Range: 180 ±20 ft-lbs, Load Offset: ±180 ft-lbs; Yawing Moment - 130 ±20 ft-lbs, Load Offset: ±130 ft-lbs. These ranges are based on prior wind tunnel tests and planned future capabilities.  The proposed balance shall have the capability to easily offset the applied loads with no degradation in performance. These offset loads are to be included within the positive and negative design load ranges as designated above. The external balance and all associated equipment shall possess a minimum factor of safety in design loading of 2.5.  All calibrated forces and moments shall be resolved about the Moment Reference Center (MRC).  The MRC of the external balance shall maintain a spherical tolerance of 1/32 inch diameter or less during all wind tunnel operations (wind on). This tolerance includes (but is not limited to) model loading and motion as defined herein. The MRC of the proposed external balance shall be aligned vertically along the turntable axis of rotation of the Wind Tunnel Test Section (21” above the turntable). This position shall be within a tolerance which prevents fouling between the balance metric and non-metric components.  The MRC of the proposed external balance shall coincide axially with the test section midplane (52” – 57” downstream of the test section inlet plane) within ±1/32 inch.  Balance system accuracy (defined as the accuracy of the complete balance system - including but not limited to balance frames, load cells, signal conditioning equipment, data acquisition system, etc.) must meet standards traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST) located in the United States. The Quoter, as part of his quote submission, shall indicate balance system accuracy. It is desired that the balance system be accurate to within ±0.01% of full-scale load or moment including hysteresis, non-linearity, and repeatability. The accuracy required is at the final point of the measurement chain (i.e., computer screen) and, hence, includes all balance system components (e.g., load cells, connections, signal conditioning, computer interface, etc.).  Balance system resolution is to be defined as the minimum measurable load or moment that the external balance system (including but not limited to balance frames, load cells, signal conditioning equipment, data acquisition system, etc.) shall indicate. The minimum system resolution for each component of the balance system is as follows: Normal Force (lift) - Maximum Component Resolution: 0.060 lbs, Percent Full Scale: 0.010%; Axial Force (drag) – Maximum Component Resolution: 0.010 lbs, Percent Full Scale: 0.005%; Side Force - Maximum Component Resolution: 0.060 lbs, Percent Full Scale: 0.010%; Rolling Moment - Maximum Component Resolution: 0.025 ft-lbs, Percent Full Scale: 0.010%; Pitching Moment - Maximum Component Resolution: 0.015 ft-lbs, Percent Full Scale: 0.008%; Yawing Moment - Maximum Component Resolution: 0.010 ft-lbs, Percent Full Scale: 0.008%.  Repeatability: The external balance system shall be able to repeat identical loading conditions to within the requirements listed in this document at long and short durations. The Quoter shall specify in his quote the intervals for checking repeatability of the balance system. The repeatability required is at the final point of the measurement chain and includes all balance system components (e.g., load cells, connections, signal conditioning, computer interface, etc.). Interactions - To simplify balance operations, checks, and calibrations, Quoter shall ensure that interactions between the balance components will be well defined and will behave as linearly as possible. The balance shall be a six component design with a maximum interaction into any one component by all other components for any given loading not to exceed two (2.0) percent of the full scale range.  Load Cells - Load transducers shall resolve to at least 1 part in 8000 with a total repeatability and hysteresis of 0.005 percent of full scale or better.  It is desired that the balance load cells be compatible with the existing wind tunnel data acquisition system (Agilent E8408A VXI Mainframe/VXI Technology VT1419A).  Load cells with analog or digital output per current IEEE standards are satisfactory as long as overall balance requirements are satisfied. Proprietary or vendor-specific interfaces are not acceptable. The load cells shall require certificates of conformance for span and zero temperature compensation at the time of acceptance. Quoter shall specify the proposed maintenance and calibration schedule for load cells.  The load cells shall have a maximum combined static error band consisting of hysteresis, non-linearity, and repeatability that satisfy all balance system requirements.  The balance shall have a simple and quick load cell swap-out capability to be used to replace failed or out-of-calibration load cells. Load cell swap-out shall not affect the calibration in effect at the time of the change.  Load cell electrical outputs must be properly shielded, grounded, and insulated to assure overall balance measurement accuracy.  Load cells shall utilize standard connectors (IEEE) and interfaces. Proprietary and/or custom connectors or interfaces shall not be used.  Load cells shall have a self-calibration feature to enable the tunnel staff to determine faults in the load cell with relative ease.  Quoter shall, in his quote, propose and estimate cost of one complete set of spare load cells to be stored on-site during normal operations.  Balance Installation - The balance shall be fastened to the laboratory floor beneath the wind tunnel test section.  The balance must be capable of being removed, if necessary, for off-site maintenance and calibration. The installation shall be positioned on a solid, elevated pier of height 30±6" to minimize or prevent future flood damage.  The balance must be enclosed within the space available below the test section of the wind tunnel. This space is approximately 60" x 96" x 39±6" high. The balance turntable mechanism shall be mounted flush with the floor of the test section. The mechanism shall be located below the test section with provision for a removable floor fairing that will minimize airflow from interfering with the turntable or the force/moment measurements.  The balance space shall have a provision for being sealed off from the surrounding room, to prevent airflow around the balance components and into the test section. Deflections between the metric and non-metric components of the balance shall be less than 1/32 inch in any axis of travel.  Quoter shall ensure in his quote that all flexures, load cells, and other critical components of the balance that require periodic inspection or maintenance shall be easily accessed and maintained without altering the calibration of the balance.  Model Support - The balance shall be capable of supporting a model in the center of the test section using one-, two-, or three-strut configurations to accommodate a variety of models. The two-strut spacing shall be variable over the (30”) diameter of the turntable.  The balance shall be capable of supporting a half-model or a semi-span wing mounted to the balance turntable.

P/N 400PC CableMaster; 1 ea. P/N 894040 Calibration Plug; and 1 ea. Special Grounding.  This item is used to perform critical electrical test for both prior-to-use validity and failure mitigation on electrical umbilical cables used as part of the TOMAHAWK Torpedo Tube-Launched (TTL) All-Up-Round and has been used since the inception of the program.  Its calibration plug allows for in-house calibration of the unit.  This device is proprietary to Chatsworth.  It is sole source because the CableMaster 400PC is the only electrical tester that has the capability to interface with the J29 connector – a proprietary design of ITT Cannon.  The J29 connector is an integral component of the TOMAHAWK TTL Electrical Umbilical Cable.  The solicitation is not expected to be released before July 30, 2004.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Bioinformatics (NCICB), plans to procure on a sole source basis seeks the services of personnel with expertise in biochemistry and molecular biology to curate pathway data for entry into NCI's Pathway Interaction Database.   It is important that this data be correct, be backed by current literature, and be seen as authoritative by the user community.  The supplies and services are being procured in accordance with FAR Part 12 and 13.5.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Center for Bioinformatics (NCICB) has established a Pathway Interaction Database (PID) (publicly-accessible at http://cmap.nci.nih.gov/PW/) in order to provide a highly structured, curated repository of information about known biomolecular interactions.  Due to the clinical and therapeutic aims of the NCI, the PID is intended primarily to capture information about interactions known or believed to take place in humans.  It includes signaling, metabolic, and regulatory pathways.   The quality of the information currently in the PID is uncertain and it is certainly incomplete.  Contractor shall be responsible for entering further data and ensuring the quality in terms of consistency and reliability.  Additional information will come from a variety of sources, including journals, reference works and databases (including those that form part of the NCI's emerging caBIG bioinformatics project).  The long-term plan is that the database contents will be authored in close collaboration with invited external experts (preferably with these experts doing most of the actual data entry, though it remains to be seen how feasible this will be).  Other independent experts would be invited to peer-review the information before it is published. The aim is to provide an accurate representation of the scientific consensus, using facts published in the peer-reviewed literature. Contractor Requirements: 1) Contractor shall be responsible for assessing the quality and comprehensiveness of the PID data, biological pathway data;  2) Contractor shall create additional data, (biological pathway data) to be added to the PID. This data shall be based on refereed papers appearing in publications of the Nature Publishing Group (NPG), including Nature, Nature Biotechnology, Nature Cell Biology, Nature Genetics, Nature Medicine, Nature Structural & Molecular Biology, Nature Reviews Cancer, Nature Reviews Drug Discovery, Nature Reviews Genetics, Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology and Nature Clinical Practice Oncology; 3) Contractor shall conduct an assessment of the scientific utility of queries.  In addition, Contractor shall provide estimates of the scale that the database would need to reach in order to answer further scientifically valuable questions (as defined by users, potential users, the NCI and the Contractor);  4) Contractor shall collate of a small number of textual highlights to provide context for the data.  These will be sourced mainly or exclusively from existing NPG journal content, with little or no commissioned content; 5) Contractor shall conduct an assessment of the PID's position and distinctiveness relative to the Reactome database to see if it is possible to curate data in such a way that it can be imported into both databases, and to assess if the editorial scope and processes of each database are sufficiently compatible to warrant this level of data sharing; 6) Contractor shall conduct an assessment of the suitability of emerging data exchange formats such as SBML, CellML, BioPAX and HUPO PSI.  The standards that describe the format are scientific data. To properly evaluate the utility and appropriateness of these standards, one has to understand the domain of biological pathways; 7) Contractor shall identify technical or web design changes in the PID that may be required to capture additional pathway information (for example, information about data sources and about different cell types) or to enhance usability of the database.  Period of Performance:  September 2004 - August 2005.  The Nature Publishing Group (NPG) is uniquely qualified to perform the role of curator of the NCI's database, they are recognized as the premier publisher of current research in biochemistry and molecular biology; (2) NPG editors have early editorial access to the largest collection of current high-quality research relevant to biological pathways; (3) NPG has experience in curating pathway data for web publication (in particular the Alliance for Cell Signaling, http://www.signaling-gateway.org).  Nature Publishing Group is the only known source with an extensive background in biochemistry and in molecular biology.  Their privileged access, to the largest collection of top-quality research publications in molecular biology, no other contractor to ensure the correctness of NCI's database to the same level, nor could any other contractor invest the NCI's pathway database with the same level of authority.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, September 20, 2004.  If you have any questions they must be submitted in writing to Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent, at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The US Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service in Parlier, Ca. has a requirement for an elemental analysis system will be mounted on and used with the existing Hitachi S-3500N Scanning Electron Microscope.  This piece of equipment will allow for the rapid detection and quantification of elements of atomic number greater than boron in biological specimens.  Detector. is a room temperature detector that does not require constant cooling with liquid nitrogen like a traditional Si(Li) detector. The detector will provide better FWHM resolution, and give better detection limits, meaning will be able examine samples that contain carbon. Also the speed at which one will be able to collect a spectra will be reduced exponentially.  The Si(Li)-type detector is only cable of 3000 counts per second, but the QDD is cable of over 100,000 cps.  VideoSEM – This feature allows a digital movie to be made and saved in an AVI format.  The ability to generate movies that show different perspectives of the sample in relation to the elemental analysis of the sample can greatly further the understanding of the specimen’s elemental make up. 3D Visualization and mapping– This feature can show the topography of the sample and the elemental make up of the sample in relation to the specimen topography.  ChemType – This is similar to a function known as particle count, but more is more advanced.  After it has identified a particle (bright, or dark) it then performs spectral analysis on it to determine what is its composition. Softtware license agreement – This will allow us to install the Evex Software on other machines such as the one in my office, so the SEM/EDS system could be used for remote analysis thus freeing up the microscope – x-ray detector for examination of other specimens.  A RFQ is not available for this notice the USDA plans on negotiating with Evex (Princeton, NJ) directly.  Interested firms are encouraged to present proposal to the attention of Fred Gifford as list above.  See number note 22.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   The U.S. EPA, National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL)/ Water Supply and Water Resources Division (WSWRD) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), Genomics Core Facility under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 to perform DNA sequencing of 16S rDNA environmental clones.  The Contractor perform sequencing reactions and analysis of sequence electropherograms.  This information will be used by EPA to identify and characterize gene sequences and to develop gene specific PCR primers. EPA will  provide the bacterial cultures that contain the clones to be sequenced.  These will consist of transformed Escherichia coli cells with plasmid (e.g., TA vector) containing the clone of interest.  An agarose gel will be provided by EPA as evidence of insert quality and purity. The Contractor shall  perform plasmid purification, sequencing reaction, cleaning of sequencing reactions, and sequencing electrophoresis. Most clones will be of approximately 700 bp, but they could range between 400bp and 1500 bp. The contractor shall perform all sequencing reactions with M13F or M13R universal  sequencing primers. The goal is to produce overlapping sequences that will facilitate the sequence analysis of environmental clones. In the case of clones longer that 1200bp, no significant overlap is expected.  It is estimated that a minimum of 65 deep well plates (containing 96 clones per plate)  will be processed as part of this task. Each plate shall be sequenced in both directions.  As most genes to be sequenced are 500-700 bases in length, the Contractor shall provide a minimum of 650 bases per reaction of high quality (Phred  20). For each sequencing reaction, the Contractor shall  provide a readout compatible with sequencing analysis software such as Sequencher or DNA Star.   The output (i.e., electropherogram) shall consist of a minimum of 750 bases per reaction with Phred 20 value per read. 5-10 plates will be processed per environmental library and no more than 8  libraries will be developed.  EPA will provide the bacterial cultures as often as once or twice a month.  The Contractor shall submit the sequencing data in electronic form to the Project Officer.  A local contractor is required  to minimize potential degradation of DNA.  In addition, the project  requires sequencing five to six hundred reactions per experiment in 2-3 days. The Contractor shall use capillary sequencers which can process over a thousand reactions per 24 hours, like the ABI 3730XL sequencer4. Cultures must be processed the same day to minimize artifacts that are introduced  when processing is delayed for more than 24 hours.  This notice is not a request for quotations.  EPA source research indicates that CCHMC is uniquely qualified to meet this requirement based on the fact that it is the only local organization capable to perform the required services, based on its  combined high throughput capability, proximity to EPA's research facility, and ability to provide same-day sample processing.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the statement of  work.  Such documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.   A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be  considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The applicable NAICS code is 541990.  The anticipated award date is  10/4/04.  See Numbered Note 26.

DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  
PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Dr. Roberto Tapia, Director de Relaciones Internacionales, Ministerio de Salud, Mac-Iver 541, Santiago, Chile; Phone:  011-56-2-630-0684/7; Fax: 011-56-2-639-1971.  
The Ministry of Health (“the Grantee”) invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to perform Technical Assistance for the Santiago and Concepcion Hospital Renovation Projects in Chile.

The Chilean Ministry of Health requested USTDA funding to help plan its priority projects using U.S. models of clinical management and hospital administrative systems to provide the most cost-effective healthcare delivery possible.  The Ministry oversees Chile’s national health service, FONASA, which operates a network of approximately 200 hospitals and 500 outpatient clinics that serve 80% of Chile’s population of 15 million.  The Salvador-Infante Hospital Complex is the largest in the Santiago metropolitan area and is the major tertiary level care hospital.  It has a primary patient base of 500,000 and is a regional and national referral hospital for advanced medical and surgical cases.  The main hospital has 500 beds and the complex includes cardiothoracic, neurosurgical, and geriatric institutes. The renovation project will seek to address the problems of outdated facilities, inadequate equipment, a growing demand for service, rising health care costs, and the lack of an effective and integrated primary care system, modern clinical management practices and cost accounting systems. The technical assistance will focus on the Salvador-Infante Hospital and will develop recommendations that can be adapted to the needs of the G.G. Benavente Hospital complex in Concepción, and other hospitals in the FONASA system. The G.G. Benavente hospital is a tertiary care hospital with 900 beds and an annual budget of $60 million.  The complex includes a trauma center that has 85 beds and a 105% occupancy rate.  The project is estimated to cost $23.3 million.  It will involve the expansion of the G.G. Benavente Hospital, the construction of a new ambulatory care and outpatient surgery facility, the construction of an expanded trauma center, and the re-organization and consolidation of medical services at the two community hospitals in Lota and Coronel that serve as feeder hospitals for patients needed specialty care.

The technical assistance will assist the Ministry of Health planners with adapting U.S. models of hospital planning, clinical management and administration to fit the needs of the Salvador Infante hospital complex and G.G. Benavente hospital complex projects.  The technical assistance tasks can be summarized as follows:

1.	Review background information and financing plans
2.	Develop recommendations for clinical management systems
3.	Review environmental impact and identify mitigating actions and the associated costs
4.	Develop plans and designs for hospital and outpatient clinic administration and management systems
5.	Evaluate current architectural plans and make recommendations on needed revisions
6.	Develop plans and provide recommendations on appropriate equipment and technologies
7.	Prepare and Present the Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $310,840 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Spanish directly to the Grantee by 5:00PM, October 22, 2004 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>17.	The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract with L-3 Communications Integrated Systems in Greenville, Texas, in order to procure approximately 6 Enhanced Special Structural Inspections (ESSIs) and preemptive material replacement on defined areas to include Center Wing Replacements, as required, on U.S. Navy’s P-3 aircraft.  These ESSIs will be procured to address and repair the structural fatigue and safety concerns of Maritime Patrol Aircraft.  ESSI includes Special Structural Inspections (detailed inspection to detect fatigue damage in critical outer wing locations) and is a major preemptive structural repair to the inner and outer wing surfaces, plates, beam, planks and fittings, with inspection and on-condition repair of center wing structure and fuel weep holes.  ESSI efforts are currently being performed under Contracts N00019-03-C-0063 and N00019-04-C-0097 with L-3 Communications Integrated Systems.  This action will be negotiated on a sole source basis with L-3 Communications under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements), as L-3 Communications Integrated Systems is the only known source that has the available capacity and special tooling to complete the ESSIs in order to meet the needs of the Fleet.  The approximate contract award date is October 2004 with aircraft inductions beginning in November 2004.  The North American Industry Classification System Code for this requirement is 336413.

<CONTACT>Charles Briggs, Contracting Officer, Phone (310) 336-4748, Fax (310) 336-4075, Email charles.briggs@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) MILSATCOM Joint Program Office (MJPO) intends to acquire continuing MILSATCOM space communications support for Fiscal Year 2005 in general systems engineering, simulation and modeling, analysis tools maintenance and upgrades, and systems integration.  The currently envisioned effort is primarily for the secure/survivable Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellite program and required interfacing systems. AEHF is the follow-on to the Milstar system, which augments and improves on Milstar capabilities and expands the MILSATCOM architecture to enable Transformational Communications and Network-Centric Warfare. Contracted effort shall provide general systems engineering support for the AEHF program, including ongoing efforts in the areas of design, development, test, computer simulation/verification, manufacturing, and integration of the AEHF system. Contracted effort shall include support for AEHF backward compatibility requirements and related operational issues on Milstar; the payload subsystem; payload-to-terminal interface requirements, including acquisition and tracking, access control protocols, resource management, and assured access; information assurance concepts, including the key management plan and architecture, key authentication, key distribution, AEHF COMSEC/TRANSEC System products/schedule/issues, and cryptographic key management for test assets; foreign disclosure related tasks to support the International Partners, including redaction of technical documents, processing and coordination of foreign disclosure material; verification, system test, and test program coordination; AEHF training; Milstar-to-AEHF transition and concept of operations development; and advanced studies and concept development. Contracted effort shall maintain and upgrade the AEHF MILSATCOM End-to-End Simulation Environment (AEHF MEESE) software/hardware tools, developed by LinQuest Corporation under Air Force contract F04707-98-C-0046 and Army CECOM GSA contract GS-35F-0357-J, and potentially the Milstar MEESE. The contractor shall update AEHF MEESE software, firmware and hardware to emulate AEHF payload and terminal designs. The contracted effort shall add new functionality required to perform system-level analyses supporting systems engineering activities, such as system performance evaluations of end-to-end satellite links, adaptive antenna performance, independent verification of system capabilities to provide confidence for sell-off of system communications performance requirements, system anomaly resolution and impact assessment studies, and proof of concept demonstrations for advanced studies and concept development. Contracted effort shall provide systems integration to ensure an independent systems integration assessment is conducted for the end-to-end MILSATCOM systems. Systems integration will include, but not be limited to, the Space Segment, Command and Control Segment, terminal cryptographic and key products suppliers, acceptance and testing organizations, and war fighter end users requirements. Effort will include analysis of system interdependencies, development and delivery of integrated system schedules, technical compliance analyses, analysis of interface control documentation, test planning and reports, and briefings. The effort will also include the development of a systems integration process description and a risk management framework, and support to end-to-end inter-segment systems engineering, system level requirements allocation and configuration control, systems level verification and validation, and system security engineering. Extensive systems engineering experience, knowledge, and background dealing with DoD-specific capabilities in the EHF secure satellite communications field and a minimum Government security clearance of Secret are mandatory. Familiarity and experience working with DoD customers, to include the Air Force Space Command, MJPO, Army, Navy, and Air Force Terminal Program Offices (TPOs), is required to resolve terminal to payload requirements issues. Training in international programs security requirements and international security and technology transfer/control; familiarity with National Disclosure Policy (NDP-1), the Air Force Delegation of Disclosure Authority Letter (DDL), and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR); and experience in processing Exemptions to the ITAR and the process of formulating Technical Assistance Agreements (TAAs) between US contractors and foreign governments and their contractors is required. This program effort is an extension of the MILSATCOM support contract currently being performed by LinQuest Corporation, a small business. It is anticipated that only the incumbent contractor has sufficient relevant experience to meet the requirements of this acquisition. This notice is primarily intended for subcontracting opportunities. However, interested parties must submit an unclassified Statement of Capability (SOC) 10 calendar days after this announcement is posted, demonstrating knowledge in the requirements areas described above. The SOC shall not exceed 10 pages in length. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only; it does not constitute a RFP. The Government will not recognize any direct costs associated with submission of a SOC. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining the type of procurement. Submit all responses to: SMC/MCK, Attn: Charles Briggs, 2420 Vela Way, Suite 1467 A-8, El Segundo, CA 90245-4659. The period of performance is one year from 1 Oct 04 to 30 Sep 05. The Government's ROM estimate for this work is $5.2M. Government-wide numbered notes 22 and 26 apply. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Extended Area Protection and Survivability (EAPS) Science and Technology (S&T) Program Architecture Study will provide concept definition,  requirements analysis, functional analysis, and design synthesis, and establish a baseline architecture to  enable stationary/mobile 360 degree hemispherical extended area protection and survivability of future Army combat unit assets from direct and indirect fires, including rocket, artillery and mortar (RAM), Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), and Cruise Missile (CM) threats while minimizing cost, weight, and space allowing for improved deployment and mobility. Currently no existing or programmed system has the capability to negate unguided rockets and mortar/artillery projectiles with mechanical fuzes after they are launched.  Only a limited capability exists to negate UAV reconnaissance capabilities at sufficient range to preclude detection, identification, and targeting. Protection and survivability capabilities in Army combat units faced with this threat must b e demonstrated to deter or defeat those enemy capabilities.  Current capability gaps in combat unit survivability that result from these threats are identified in Force Operating Capability (FOC) 09-01: Survivability For Stationary Hemispherical Area Prote ction, FOC 09-02: Survivability For Mobile Hemispherical Area Protection, and FOC 09-06:  Defeat/negate limited and saturation attacks of unguided and guided Rockets, Artillery and Mortar Projectile threats and improve the capability to defeat Cruise Missi les, TBMs and stand off threat UAV and RW recon capabilities at sufficient range to preclude detection, identification and targeting. The Architecture developed in this study will provide a detailed engineering definition of the system and technologies required to eliminate those gaps and shortfalls and satisfy the stated Army need.  It is the Governments intent to issue multiple Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract awards for this study to those domestic corporations that can demonstrate experience in definition, development, and lead system integration for fielded Army tactical weapon syste ms and that provide a clear understanding and a cost-effective approach to the requirements of the Statement of Work.  Only one proposal per company will be considered.  The period of performance of the contract is estimated from Jan 2005 through Dec 2009, utilizing a basic 12 month effort and four 12-month option periods.  The expected funding profile per award is $40k (baseline), $160k (option 1), $200k (option 2), $200k  (option 3), and $300k (option 4); or more depending upon funding availability.  The Government will fully utilize the internet and electronic submission to issue the solicitation and amendments; offerors shall submit an email request for the solicitation within fifteen days from the publication of the synopsis. (Instructions will be p rovided for accessing the internet to obtain the solicitation and amendments when issued.) Further information may be requested via e-mail to Zac.York@redstone.army.mil.

<ARCHDATE>11242004
<CONTACT>David Dilks, 312-846-5373
<DESC>By way of this notice, and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, the Chicago District. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announces its intention to award a sole source contract to the UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS of Champaign, IL/ILLINOIS STATE WATER SURVEY for the c ontinuance of operation and maintenance of the 25 raingage network for Lake Michigan Diversion Accounting. The contractor has to provide all weighting-bucket raingages with data loggers at the sites in secure areas with little or no obstructions using a U. S. Army Corps of Engineers approved 5-7 mile grid spacing between gages.  Given that 1) the raingage network was originally designed and installed by the University of Illinois/Illinois State Water Survey in 1989; 2) all raingage equipment and secured site s have already been in use and held by the University of Illinois/Illinois State Water Survey for a period of 15 years; and 3) the consistency of precipitation measurement data is essential to the project, they are uniquely familiar with the operation and maintenance of this specific raingage network and assessment of the data collected. Therefore, we consider this acquisition to be available from one source (University of Illinois/Illinois State Water Survey). The contract performance period is for approxi mately 12 months with three one-year option periods. It is anticipated that the resultant contract will be firm-fixed-priced. This notice is NOT a Request for Proposals, therefore, NO solicitation documents will be issued. Award is anticipated on or before  September 30, 2004. The Point of Contact for this contractual action is David Dilks, Contract Specialist at Telephone (312) 846-5373 or Email to: david.m.dilks@usace.army.mil.

<DESC>The NIEHS is soliciting offers for a contract to conduct short-term and long-term studies in laboratory animals to evaluate the toxic and carcinogenic potential of test articles by various routes of exposure.  The project is designed to study diverse agents that may include:  food additives; colorants or flavorings; pharmaceuticals and herbal remedies; herbicides, fungicides, and pesticides; ingredients found in soaps, lotions, perfumes, and cosmetics; in detergents and cleaners; in a wide variety of consumer products; used in manufacturing, or industrial settings, etc.  The design of actual studies will vary as needed depending on the individual test agents, route(s) of exposure, and endpoints to be evaluated.  Study duration may be from a few days up to 2-years or life time.  Exposure may begin in utero or in young animals.  The routes of administration may be dosed feed, dosed water, gavage, dermal, parenteral (intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intratrachael).  These studies shall be conducted in accordance with the Specifications for the Conduct of Studies to Evaluate the Toxic and Carcinogenic Potential of Chemical, Biological and Physical Agents in Laboratory Animals for the National Toxicology Program.   Offerors are advised that if they wish to receive a contract award they shall have a working laboratory conducting studies via the routes of administration identified above and  outlined in the Statement of  Work, in place by the date of proposal submission. The Principal Investigator, Toxicologist, Chemist, Veterinarian, Health and Safety Officer, and Quality Assurance Unit Officer shall be employees of the contract laboratory (i.e., not consultants or subcontractors).   A working laboratory means that the facility has in place essential features necessary to conduct GLP toxicity/carcinogenicity studies of environmental agents involving large groups of rats and mice (e.g., environmentally controlled animal rooms, analytical laboratories, clinical laboratory, necropsy room, histology facility, etc.), and staff with appropriate expertise to expose, care for, and process large numbers of animals (e.g., chemists, toxicologists, pathologists, clinical pathologist, veterinarian, animal care technicians, prosectors, histologists, quality assessment group, etc.).  The daily interaction and constant coordination of efforts needed amongst these discipline areas throughout the in-life portion of the studies makes it critical that they be physically and organizationally together.  Award of two cost-reimbursement, completion type contracts on approximately May 1, 2005 with a ten year term on an open competition basis is contemplated as a result of this solicitation.  The estimated level of effort is approximately  719,400  labor hours for the base contract and 169,955 for all options.  The anticipated release date of the RFP is approximately August 16, 2004 with proposals due on approximately October 14, 2004.   Interested organizations should request a copy of the solicitation by submitting a written request to the point of contact.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.  The electronic version of the Fed Biz Opps synopsis will be available on the Internet at: <http://www.niehs.nih.gov/dert/rcb/rfp.htm> .  An electronic copy of the RFP (without the NTP Specifications) will be posted to this site on or about the RFP release date.  This requirement is unrestricted.  NAICS Code is 541710.  Numbered Note 22 applies.  Effective with the date of this amendment, the RFP is hereby revised to delete and replace page 8 of Sample Work Assignment C of Attachment 1, the Statement of Work, with the attached page 8 which corrects the rat specie in Paragraph IV.A, the number and basis for concentrations for dams in Paragraph IV.B1., and the number of test groups for treatment and totals for treatment and control groups for pups in Paragraph IV.B.2 in the Optional Phase 4: 2-year study.  The RFP otherwise remains unchanged.  The due date and time for receipt of proposals of 3:00 pm on October 14, 2004 remains unchanged.  Please note the acknowledgment requirements in Block 11 on Standard Form 30.

<DESC>Modification No. 2 – Clarification of statement of work/responsibilities in response to questions received.  This is not a revised statement of work – only a clarification of a part of the work.

To clarify the expectations of the government for soil map compilation for digital database development in Georgia the contractor will be required to perform the following as well as any other requirements in the statement of work:

Redraft (recompile) all soil lines and map symbols onto government furnished mylar.  The Government will furnish the scaled ratioed film  enlargement of the mosaic (old photograph) and an  orthophoto base map (new photograph).  Both photographs will be at 1:12,000 scale.  The contractor is responsible for redrafting lines and symbols from scaled enlargements to the digital orthophotography mylar.  The contractor will provide two mylar sheets for each quarter quad in the survey area.  One mylar sheet will contain the recompiled soil lines and one mylar sheet will contain the soil labels along with special features (wet spots, rock outcrops, etc.)  Both mylar sheets will contain four corner ties with coordinates.  The contractor is not to perform the digital scanning, only the manual cartographic work required to ready the soil lines and symbols on the mylar for digital scanning by the government.

<CONTACT>Tiffany Stuck, Contract Specialist , Phone 703-681-0752, Fax null, Email stuckt@ncr.disa.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to extend the response date of the RFI from 15 September 2004 to 22 September 2004.  All other items remain unchanged.  

The Defense Information System Agency (DISA)/ Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization – National Capital Region (DITCO-NCR) hereby issues the following Request for Information (RFI) regarding a follow on contract to the Defense Message System (DMS) Transition Hub Software and Systems Engineering, and Transition Support contract to expire July 2005.  This RFI is prepared in accordance with FAR Part 12 for Commercial Items.  
A. PURPOSE:  The Government seeks information for providing Command and Control messaging requirement capabilities primarily via the National Gateway Center (NGC) and DMS infrastructure, and operational support required to enable Command and Control communications interoperability between the multiple messaging solutions implemented by the services and agencies. The information gathered on industry capabilities from this RFI will assist in the development of a future Request for Proposal.  
B. INTENT:  The RFI is intended to gather information about the availability of technology/products in the market place that will fulfill anticipated requirements for these services and other value-added elements. Information submitted in response to this RFI will become the property of the Government.  The Government will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this RFI. This request for information or "sources sought" shall not be construed as a request for proposal.  Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified.  The Government will not pay for information provided, and is not liable for any costs incurred by the company in response to this RFI.  Price quotes are not required, however, general cost estimates are appreciated to assist in planning.  Cost estimates provided will not be binding for the company.  The government is anticipating the competitive award of a one (1) year base period with four (4) one (1) year option periods for a total of five years, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract (or multiple contracts, if determined to be in the best interest of the Government).
C. DESIRED INFORMATION:  The Government desires information on industry capabilities to support the services and features listed below.  This list is neither detailed nor all-inclusive, but is a representative of the type of services the Government is interested in.  The Government will consider responses to this request for information in defining its requirements and alternatives.  Draft task areas include: The National Gateway Center legacy component software life cycle maintenance for the Message Processor, Line Traffic Coordinator, Line Control Module, Line Terminator Unit, System Alarm Panel, System Command Console, Bulk Storage Subsystem, and Monitor Test and Status Subsystem.  This unique assembly language message switching software is approximately 35 years old, does not use commercial operating systems, and has been modified several thousand times.  Because of its age and unique real-time functionality, the current operational NGC legacy software is unstructured and poorly documented. Other task areas include: software maintenance/database update of the NGC Acceptance Test Procedures Replacement System (ATPRS), and DMS Message Conversion System; NGC tool maintenance/enhancement to support operational requirements and legacy/DMS database synchronization; engineering support of legacy users not fully transitioned to DMS; system engineering support for analysis and resolution of operational DMS user and interface issues; Command and Control messaging evolution support; independent technical review of proposed system/architectural design changes and issue resolutions; independent product functionality and integration testing of DMS backbone and service level component software, to include test plan and test report generation; engineering support for requirements definition and operational  implementation of an Allied Gateway messaging capability and other capabilities required to sustain Allied messaging interoperability; generation of DITSCAP and related documentation required for security accreditation and certification of Command and Control messaging systems; support to the DMS Global Systems Manager for the creation and maintenance of global DMS operational documentation (e.g., Interim Procedures, CONOPS and DISA Circulars), providing  configuration management and asset control functions, and procurement assistance for DMS infrastructure technology refresh; and, organizational messaging transition engineering.  It is the intent of the Government to award all task areas under one contract in order to maintain a comprehensive Command and Control messaging approach to fully address operational messaging requirements from a global perspective.  A SECRET clearance is required by all contractor personnel.  TOP SECRET clearance and SCI/SIOP accesses are required by approximately Sixty percent (60%) of contractor personnel.  
D. SUBMISSION OF COMMENTS:  Interested contractors are requested to submit capability statements that explicitly address all task areas individually and collectively as a whole.  Capability statements must include specific corporate and personnel expertise relative to each tasking area.  Capability statements must also clearly demonstrate past company successes in providing responsive and effective actions when tasked with software and system life cycle maintenance responsibilities of an operational Command and Control communications system.  All comments in response to this RFI should be submitted electronically via e-mail not later than 1200 EST on 15 September 2004 using MS Word 7.0 or later.  The point-of-contact for submitting comments is Major Joseph Jupiter at JupiterJ@ncr.disa.mil.  Comments received after that date may not be considered.  Proprietary information should be identified as such.  Contractors are to include the name, address, telephone number, and email address of their point(s) of contact; capability and expertise statements as requested above; the company's business size, including applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code(s); and a list of references.  Expect a draft RFP to be posted to the Contracting Opportunities Home Page in the fall of 2004.  If you experience any problems or have any questions concerning this request for information, call Major Joseph Jupiter between the hours of 0900 and 1700 hours EST, Monday through Friday.
A list of interested companies that respond to this request will be made available on DITCO’s web site at www.ditco.disa.mil.  This is intended to facilitate partnerships/subcontracting opportunities.

A)	Background

The USAID Regional Mission for Central Asia (USAID/CAR) is a regional USAID Mission with responsibility for the development and management of the U.S. Government’s assistance program for the five Central Asian Republics.  This program is directed at supporting a program of policy reform, humanitarian assistance economic recovery, democratic and social transition in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.

Tajikistan poses one of the most difficult development challenges in the region.  This small isolated country was already the poorest of the republics when part of the Soviet Union, but civil war and economic collapse since independence have now reduced over 80% of the population to poverty.  The country has begun to see a political and economic turnaround since peace accords were signed in 1997.  Tajikistan is on the front line of pressing U.S. concerns in the region: narcotics trafficking and terrorism, Islamic extremism, democratic transition, economic reform, and management of region's vast water resources.  USAID assistance to the country was initially focused on urgent humanitarian needs and supporting the peace process.  Under the new assistance strategy for Central Asia, USAID is increasingly supporting the country’s longer-term development needs, while still meeting humanitarian needs.     
     
The incumbent serves as the Deputy for Tajikistan Country Officer in USAID/CAR.  In that position s/he is responsible for assisting in oversight and coordination of approximately $18 million annually assistance portfolio implemented through four institutional contractors and 20 international private voluntary organizations (PVOs).  The position also assists in coordinating on behalf of the U.S. Ambassador a $35 million U.S. Department of Agriculture food aid program involving four U.S. PVOs and the United Nation's World Food Programme (WFP).

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI), ROBOTIC LUNAR EXPLORATION PROGRAM (RLEP), ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY FOR SPACE PLATFORM ARCHITECTURES THIS IS *NOT* A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION, OR INVITATION TO BID NOTICE. RFI Purpose: NASA/GSFC is seeking advanced technology in order to best achieve and execute the Robotic Lunar Exploration Program (RLEP).  We are therefore requesting information regarding technologies, approaches and techniques for accomplishing this. While our intent may be to team with industrial partner(s), we are not bound by this RFI to do so. It is neither a Request for Proposal, nor a Request for Quotation, nor an Invitation to Bid. Therefore, this RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract, nor will the Government pay for information provided in response to this RFI.  Technology Advances: The traditional subsystem elements that current space system architectures embody are typically too heavy and power intensive. The extreme challenges for weight efficiency on lunar missions makes it essential that the space systems utilized in RLEP place a lower burden on system resources then the current state of the art in order that meaningful payloads can be supported. Therefore the RLEP is seeking technologies that would substantially advance space platform architectures in a manner that materially expands functional capability, adaptability, and reliability while significantly reducing power and weight as compared to current systems. The technologies sought must be of sufficient maturity that they could be readied for utilization in the early RLEP missions. This inquiry seeks information on specific, focused applications ideas, not generic technologies, which could substantially improve the efficiencies of the potential system that may be flown. Information: The NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is interested in soliciting the overall concepts, estimates of cost and development schedules, and development risk evaluations.  The objectives of this RFI are: 1) to improve NASA's knowledge of industry's capabilities; 2) to improve the overall understanding of what the technology options are for RLEP; and  3) to invite industry to submit information that will allow NASA to assess the partnering opportunities that exist within industry.  NASA has established a website (   http://lunar.gsfc.nasa.gov	) containing the latest information regarding the RLEP and its associated missions. Interested parties can visit this site to learn more about the program and how it fits into NASA's overall exploration initiative. To consolidate our planning, we request responses from industry within 30 days of the release date of this RFI, in the form of written and illustrated concepts, ideas, and descriptions of capabilities. We plan to invite formal presentations and discussions at GSFC of the more compelling responses within 45 days of the RFI issuance. Responses can be submitted via email. The subject line of the submission should be "RFI for RLEP Advanced Technology for Space Platform Architecture," and attachments should be in Microsoft WORD, POWERPOINT, or PDF format. The email text must give a point-of-contact and provide his/her name, address, telephone/fax numbers, and email address. The information is requested for planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled "Solicitation for Information for Planning Purposes." It is not NASA's intent to publicly disclose vendor proprietary information obtained during this solicitation. To the full extent that it is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations, information identified by a respondent as "Proprietary or Confidential" will be kept confidential. It is emphasized that this RFI is for planning and information purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.	 No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI), ROBOTIC LUNAR EXPLORATION PROGRAM (RLEP), LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER (LRO) MISSION GROUND SYSTEM AND MISSION OPERATIONS THIS IS *NOT* A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION, OR INVITATION TO BID NOTICE. RFI Purpose: The Robotic Lunar Exploration Program (RLEP) plans to develop, or acquire, launch, and operate the 2008 Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), the first in a series of lunar exploration missions. We are requesting information regarding approaches and techniques for building and operating the ground system and performing mission operations for the mission. The Announcement of Opportunity, AO # NNH04ZSE003O (  http://centauri.larc.nasa.gov/lro/  ) for the payload has been released and selection of the instruments that will comprise the payload will be made in November 2004. In the AO a straw man spacecraft and mission developed at GSFC is referenced as a baseline. This RFI seeks alternative approaches to providing and operating the ground segment, including the mission operations center, while meeting the requirements and payload accommodation commitments outlined in the AO. While our intent may be to team with industrial partner(s), we are not bound by this RFI to do so. It is neither a Request for Proposal, nor a Request for Quotation, nor an Invitation to Bid. Therefore, this RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract, nor will the Government pay for information provided in response to this RFI.  Desired Performance: LRO will be launched into a direct trajectory to the moon on an ELV in October 2008 and be inserted into a circular polar orbit with an altitude of 30-50 km. Its primary mission is one year in duration with a goal of being designed to operate for up to five years in an extended mission.  Ground Communication Network The baseline design utilizes S-band frequencies for commanding and engineering telemetry and Ka-band for high-speed observation data downlink. The baseline space segment communication system assumes a 5W transmitter and a 1.0 m high gain antenna although the design has not been finalized, as trade studies are ongoing and these parameters may change. LRO will require the downlink of up to 1000 Gbits/day during the primary one-year mission. The ground network must also support ranging of LRO at the Moon sufficient to enable orbit determination with an accuracy of 18 m radial/500 m RMS positional. Conceptual network designs should include estimates for the downlink G/T and the uplink EIRP. Mission Operations LRO is to be operated from a central Mission Operations Center (MOC) that is networked to the Principal Investigators (PIs) instrument operations centers and to the GSFC Flight Dynamics Facility.  The contractors MOC staff will be trained as an integral part of the LRO development team and will function as test conductors during the integration and test phase of LRO development.  Mission operations systems to be used during the mission must be compatible with and available for use for spacecraft operation during LRO integration and testing. Further information about the LRO mission can be found in the AO Proposal Information Package (PIP) in the AO library,   http://centauri.larc.nasa.gov/lro/   . Other Considerations: LRO will require nearly continuous tracking and daily high volume data transmissions in order to accomplish the requirement of providing global mapping of the Moon. The ground network must be robust because in some cases specific lunar observations will occur on only a single orbital pass during the LRO mission. $90 million of the first mission (LRO) has already been earmarked for the payload. Setting aside reserves, that leaves $250 million for all other aspects of the mission, beginning with concept definition, through launch and mission operations. Although this RFI has focused on support of the LRO mission, the RLEP program is comprised of a series of potentially overlapping missions to the Moon. The program is interested in the potential of systems proposed for LRO expanding to support multiple robotic lunar missions and eventually NASA's  manned missions to the moon that are to follow. Information: The NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center is interested in soliciting mission ground segment and mission operations concepts, estimates of cost and development schedules, development risk evaluations, and any comments on enabling technologies. The objectives of this RFI are: 1) to improve NASA's knowledge of industry's capabilities; 2) to improve the overall understanding of what the options are for acquiring and operating the LRO mission ground segment; and 3) to invite industry to submit information that will allow RLEP to assess the partnering opportunities that exist within industry, specifically with regards to the development of the LRO mission.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI), ROBOTIC LUNAR EXPLORATION PROGRAM (RLEP), RADIATION/BIOLOGY SURFACE DEMONSTRATION THIS IS *NOT* A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION, OR INVITATION TO BID NOTICE. RFI Purpose: The Robotic Lunar Exploration Program (RLEP) is seeking to develop a low-cost, lunar surface element to characterize the radiation environment and its effect on a living, human relatable biological agent, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of mitigation strategies to the hazards of exposure. We are therefore requesting information regarding approaches and techniques for accomplishing this goal. While our intent may be to team with industrial partner(s), we are not bound by this RFI to do so. It is neither a Request for Proposal, nor a Request for Quotation, nor an Invitation to Bid. Therefore, this RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract, nor will the Government pay for information provided in response to this RFI.  	Background:  One of the key concerns in the overall lunar exploration initiative is the long-term effects that the lunar environment has on living organisms (i.e. humans). Despite extensive Apollo data, there are still many unanswered questions, particularly for long-duration missions. It is our intent to start looking into the human health and support topics as early in the program as possible. With that in mind, we are investigating the feasibility of sending a radiation/biology experiment to the lunar surface in the 2009 timeframe within a total mission budget &lt; $300 million, to directly assess the effects on cellular health, in a manner that can be extrapolated to crew health. Remote autonomous biological experiment technologies are an area of particular interest. Such data would be extremely valuable to the human mission designers and habitat designers supporting the Exploration architecture development. Information regarding possible strategies for developing, delivering, and operating a suitable surface element, in that timeframe, is being sought. Other Considerations: There are a variety of surface element types and a variety of potential purposes for putting them on the surface. All types (hard/soft, guided/unguided, coarsely/precisely targeted, using thrusters/airbags, etc.) are going to be considered by the RLEP, as well as all potential reasons for putting them on the surface (radiation/shielding experiments, placing of biological sentinels, exploration of permanently shadowed crater regions, precision landing demonstrations, sample collection, ground truthing of orbital measurements, soil mechanics,  ejecta/subsurface analysis, seismometry, magnetometry, electrostatics investigations, heat flow experiments, and surface imaging cameras, just to name a few). An investigation into the effects of the local lunar radiation environment on biological agents is just one of the first in the series of surface questions that the RLEP is setting out to answer. That being said, the applicability of the concepts gathered during this RFI, to any of the other topic areas, will be considered. Information: The NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center is interested in soliciting the overall concepts, estimates of cost and development schedules, development risk evaluations, and any comments on enabling technologies. The objectives of this RFI are: 1) to improve NASA's knowledge of industry's capabilities; 2) to improve the overall understanding of what the surface element options are for RLEP; and 3) to invite industry to submit information that will allow NASA to assess the partnering opportunities that exist within industry, specifically with regards to the design, development, and deployment of a radiation/biology experiment, to be put forth as one of the first surface elements of RLEP. NASA has established a website (   http://lunar.gsfc.nasa.gov	) containing the latest information regarding the RLEP and its associated missions. Interested parties can visit this site to learn more about the program and how it fits into NASA's overall exploration initiative.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI), ROBOTIC LUNAR EXPLORATION PROGRAM (RLEP), WATER ICE VALIDATION CONCEPT THIS IS *NOT* A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION, OR INVITATION TO BID NOTICE. RFI Purpose: The Robotic Lunar Exploration Program (RLEP) may seek to develop a low-cost, lunar surface element (i.e. flight system), to validate the presence of ices (i.e.H2O) in the permanently shadowed regions of the Moon's polar regions, should the LRO mission provide measurement-based evidence that significant quantities of ice likely exist there. We are therefore requesting information from industry regarding approaches and techniques for accomplishing this goal. While our intent may be to team with industrial partner(s), we are not bound by this RFI to do so. It is neither a Request for Proposal, nor a Request for Quotation, nor an Invitation to Bid. Therefore, this RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract, nor will the Government pay for information provided in response to this RFI.  Background: One of the key questions in lunar exploration is whether or not there is abundant ice (i.e. H2O) trapped in the shadowed regions associated with the lunar polar areas. It is our intent to examine the feasibility of answering that question as early in the RLEP program as possible. With that in mind, the RLEP is investigating the feasibility of doing so in the 2009 timeframe within a total mission budget of &lt; $300 million. Information regarding strategies for developing, delivering, and operating a suitable surface element, to validate the presence of ice (as H2O), is therefore being sought. Other Considerations: There are a variety of surface element types and a variety of potential purposes for putting them on the lunar surface. All types (hard/soft, guided/unguided, coarsely/precisely targeted, using thrusters/airbags, etc.) will be considered by the RLEP, as well as all potential reasons for emplacing them on the surface (e.g., exploration of permanently shadowed regions, ground truthing of orbital measurements, precision landing demonstrations, sample collection, emplacement of biological sentinels, radiation/shielding experiments, soil mechanics,  ejecta/subsurface analysis, seismometry, electrostatics investigations, heat flow experiments, and surface imaging cameras, just to name a few). Ice validation is just the first in the series of possible surface activities that the RLEP is setting to out address and hopefully answer. That being said, the applicability of concepts gathered during this RFI, to any of the other topic areas, will be considered. Information: The NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center is interested in soliciting the overall concepts, estimates of cost and development schedules, development risk evaluations, and any comments on enabling technologies. The objectives of this RFI are: 1) to improve NASA's knowledge of industry's capabilities; 2) to improve the overall understanding of what the surface element options are for RLEP; and   3) to invite industry to submit information that will allow NASA to assess the partnering opportunities that exist within industry, specifically with regards to the design, development, and deployment of a water/ice validation mission, to be put forth as one of the first surface elements of the RLEP. NASA has established a website (  http://lunar.gsfc.nasa.gov  ) containing the latest information regarding the RLEP and its associated missions. Interested parties can visit this site to learn more about the program and how it fits into NASA's overall exploration initiative. To consolidate our planning, we request responses from industry within 30 days of the release date of this RFI, in the form of written and illustrated concepts, ideas, and descriptions of capabilities. We plan to invite formal presentations and discussions at GSFC of the more compelling responses within 45 days of the RFI issuance. Responses can be submitted via email. The subject line of the submission should be "RFI for RLEP Water Ice Validation Concept," and attachments should be in Microsoft WORD, POWERPOINT, or PDF format. The email text must give a point-of-contact and provide his/her name, address, telephone/fax numbers, and email address. The information is requested for planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled "Solicitation for Information for Planning Purposes." It is not NASA's intent to publicly disclose vendor proprietary information obtained during this solicitation. To the full extent that it is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations, information identified by a respondent as "Proprietary or Confidential" will be kept confidential. It is emphasized that this RFI is for planning and information purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.	 No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Technical questions should be directed to:  Joe Burt at (301) 286-2217 or Joe.Burt@nasa.gov and Martin Houghton at (301) 286-3875 or Martin.Houghton@nasa.gov.  Procurement related questions should be directed to: Julie Janus at (301) 286-4931 or Julie.A.Janus@nasa.gov. Interested offerors shall address the requirements of this RFI in written format as described in the previous paragraphs by electronic mail to: Martin Houghton at Martin.Houghton@nasa.gov, no later than 5:00 PM EST on October 12, 2004. An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet. These documents will be in Microsoft Office 97 format and will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application. The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/GSFC Business Opportunities home page is   http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=51   .  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet cite for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

<DESC>The Southern Plains Area for the Agricultural Research Service, of the U.S. Department of Agriculture intends to issue an award to RBI Instrumentation et mesure, 1 chemin de la Dhuy, ZAC de Maupertuis, 38240 MEYLAN, FRANCE.  This is a sole source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for quotations (RFQ) for competition.  This is a simplified acquisition.  The USDA, ARS, Hydraulics Engineering Research Unit, in Stillwater, Oklahoma, USA requires 1 Two-Tip Fiber-Optical Probe.  The fiber-optical device consists of three components:  (1) a fiber optical probe, (2) an opto-electronic module and (3) a computer interface board.  The later serves to save and visualize the results.  This system is specifically designed and configured for local air concentration and velocity measurements in air-water free surface flow.  The size of the probe tip (.1mm), the probe tip material (saphire), and the strength of the probe fixture are all customized features, which allow this probe to be effectively used in stepped spillway research.  
The measuring principle is based on the different refraction indices of the air and water phases.  The opto-electronic module transmits light through an optical fiber, which is connected to the probe located in the flow.  The sensitive probe tip is sharpened into an optical prism through which a fraction of the light escapes, the rest is reflected according to the refraction index of the phase at the probe.  In clear water virtually no light is reflected, whereas in dry air all light is reflected.  The optical signal is transferred into an electrical signal by means of a photosensitive diode.  The fiber-optical system has the following advantages compared to conventional resistivity probes:
1.  Signal transfer is much faster, the signal response time being only 0.033 s compared to 10 s.  2.  Sampling frequency of 102 to 103 kHz is a least one order of magnitude larger than the conventional frequency.  3.  Size of the probe tip (.1mm) is considerably smaller, so that both tiny bubbles of about the probe tip diameter can be detected and the disturbance to the flow remains small.  This device is not an off the shelf product but rather a custom designed system customized specifically for stepped spillway research.  Questions should be received within 14 calendar days of this published notification.   Questions may be directed to: Michael A. Douglas, Contracting Officer at (979) 260-9480 or Fax: (979) 260-9413.

<DESC>The Marvine-Phippsburg Highway Reconstruction project, CO PFH 16-1(1), in White River and Routt National Forests, Colorado, is tentatively scheduled for advertisement in February 2005.

The following are the Models that require continued support (* -- Contains Proprietary Sub-Routines):

DSAI, the original developer of all but one of the Models and the owner of proprietary code for seven of the Models, has been providing the required primary support and continued system enhancement work support via a subcontract arrangement. The estimated value of the contract is $850,000.00 per year and the period of performance is one base year and three option years.  Due to the complex nature of the models used by M&RA and TFSD, and their mission-essential importance to the Marine Corps, the maintenance and user assistance require capabilities beyond the technical resources and personnel assets of the Marine Corps.  Specifically, the services require the contractor to have expert knowledge of the Manpower Models to assist all model managers with operation, maintenance, training, system enhancements, and documentation updates.  No RFP is available for competitive bidding; however, interested parties are encouraged to submit a statement of capability for satisfying this requirement within 15 days of this announcement to the contact person listed above.

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:     "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent? for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.     "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;     (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-     (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and     (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.     ?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.     (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:     (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.     (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.     (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.     (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:     (i) warrants;     (ii) options;     (iii) contracts to acquire stock;     (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.     (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.     (f) Disclosure.     By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>This a combined synopsis / solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The Defense National Stockpile Center (DNSC) maintains a quantity of tungsten ores and concentrates (O&C) as part of the National Defense Stockpile.  The Government seeks to obtain a study and analysis of the economic feasibility of maintaining the tungsten in its present form or upgrading and/or converting the material to other forms in order to increase its marketability.  The study and analysis must compare the marketability of each such form with the marketability of the tungsten in its present forms.  For each upgraded form, the study must provide analysis and recommendations as to the manner in which the Government should procure such upgrading; including analysis and recommendation of how the upgrading should be funded.  The tungsten O&C was purchased by the Government in or about 1950.  The current quantity as of July 2004 is 115,173,855 bulk pounds.  The tungsten O&C is stored in variously sized drums, ranging from 15 gallon to 55 gallon. Please contact Mr Danny Lester at 703-767-5482 for the weight by type, the Government storage depot, bulk weight (pounds), net weight (pounds W), number of lots, and average analysis (percent WO3)   and  for a listing of the storage locations, with addresses and points of contact.  Analyses of the tungsten were performed in recent years by independent laboratories for content, in percent by weight, of the following:  tungsten oxide (WO3), tin (Sn), copper (Cu), arsenic (As), antimony (Sb), bismuth (Bi), molybdenum (Mo), phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), calcium (Ca), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), sodium (Na), potassium (K), beryllium (Be), magnesium (Mg), barium (Ba), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), niobium/columbium (Nb/Cb), tantalum (Ta), cadmium (Cd), aluminum (Al), silicon (Si), thorium (Th), and uranium (U).  The complete analyses for the material will be provided to the Contractor at the time of contract award. Requirements: Review the current inventory of and analytical data for each type of National Defense Stockpile tungsten O&C (ferberite, hubnerite, wolframite, scheelite and synthetic scheelite) giving consideration to the potential of upgrading or maintaining the material as O&C. Evaluate the feasibility of upgrading each of these types to each other and include an estimate of the cost for each upgrade. Evaluate the domestic and international markets, both current and for the reasonably foreseeable future, for the O&C in its present form, and for the possible upgraded forms of tungsten, (including, but not limited to, ammonium paratungstate (APT), oxide, metal powder, ferro, etc.).  Evaluate and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the marketability of each of the upgraded forms and for the O&C in its present form.  Provide a recommendation and rationale for which type or types of the O&C currently in the National Defense Stockpile, and what percentage of each type should be upgraded or should not be upgraded.  
Provide an analysis of the impact of such an upgrade program on the domestic tungsten industry.  Provide an analysis of  the economic and strategic advantages and disadvantages of each upgraded form or forms recommended.  Evaluate, analyze and provide a recommendation of how and where an upgrade program should be accomplished, i.e., domestically or in a foreign country, and if outside the United States, specify in which country or countries.  Analyze and recommend how an upgrade program should be procured and funded (including,  but not limited to, tolling, payment in kind, on a consignment basis, or acquisition).  The requirement is solicited on an open market basis for potential set-aside to a small business. 
The following FAR Part 12 clauses apply: 1) FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (no additional instructions other than noted above), 2) 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions; 3) FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes of Executive Orders-Commercial Items, additional terms: 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37; 4) DFAR 252.212-7001, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes of Executive Orders-Commercial Items, additional terms: 252.225-7001, 252-227-7015, 252.233-7000; 5) A completed copy of FAR 52.212-3 and DFAR 252.212-700, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items must be submitted with offer.

<DESC>FA8601-04-T-0161 UPDATE, 10 SEP 04 DUE DATE FOR SUBMISSION OF QUOTATION PACKAGES IS HEREBY CHANGED TO THURSDAY, 16  SEP 04, 4:00 PM EST Change 1 to the Statement of Work is attached at www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil.  Change  1 incorporates information resulting from questions received.  Changes are  highlighted in yellow. Clarification on Quotation Packages:  Statement of Work (SOW) paragraph 1.1.2  calls for an outline of equipment and procedures you intend to use in the  production of this video to be submitted with your proposal.  SOW paragraph  1.1.5 calls for an estimated detailed production schedule to be submitted with  your proposal.  Conflicting information was given in the Request for Quote  (RFQ) announcement and verbally to some potential offerors.  THIS IS TO CLARIFY  THAT THE INFORMATION REQUIRED BY PARAGRAPHS 1.1.2 AND 1.1.5 IS TO BE SUBMITTED  WITH QUOTATION PACKAGES.  This information will be used to evaluate offerors+  understanding of the requirements of the RFQ and determine technical  acceptability.     If you have already submitted a quotation package, you should submit the above  information separately.  It can be e-mailed or faxed or delivered to Helen  Williams. It must arrive by 4:00 pm EST on Thursday, 16 Sep 04.  If you feel  that the quotation package you have already submitted adequately addresses  paragraphs 1.1.2 and 1.1.5 of the SOW, no action is necessary.   Clarification on payment:  As stated in the Request for Quotation (RFQ),  contract financing will not be provided for this acquisition.  Contract  financing is defined as advance payments, performance-based payments,  commercial advance and interim payments, progress payments.  Payment will be  made in accordance with Prompt Payment Procedures after completion of entire  project.   If you do not accept this term and wish to withdraw your quotation  package, you must notify Helen Williams in writing (can be transmitted via e- mail or fax).   ***************************************************************************** FA8601-04-T-0161 UPDATE, 9 SEP 04 DUE DATE FOR SUBMISSION OF QUOTATION PACKAGES IS HEREBY CHANGED TO TUESDAY, 14  SEP 04, 4:00 PM EST. THE FOLLOWING ARE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS PERTAINING TO FA8601-04-T-0161: 1.  Q.  Does 4-color packaging refer to the printing on the DVD itself or to a  4-color insert to go inside the DVD case?   If it refers to the insert, is the  contractor responsible for writing and designing the 4-color insert? A.  If the insert means a booklet inside the DVD package, the contractor does  not need to develop.   If the insert means the cardboard label inside the clear plastic cover on the  DVD package exterior, then yes, the contractor will need to develop.  NASIC has  artwork for the package exterior, however contractor will need to modify,  include text and reproduce.   2.  Q.  Do you have an idea of the length you+re expecting for the DVD review  disk? A.  Video is expected to be 10 minutes, reviews will probably be up to the  same.    3.  Q.  Some of the historic scenes may be more available as stills.  Would you  object to a mixture of stills and live action video to cover the historic  material? A.  No, historic scenes should be moving/live video.  4. Q. Is the writer familiar with the location of the stock footage written  into the script? A.  There are dozens of stock footage houses and NASIC will not dictate where  the contractor should access/pull stock footage.  However, it would be helpful  for NASIC to review the research footage contractor receives from stock house (s) prior to purchasing to ensure adequate/suitable footage.   5.  Q.  The reference to the music on storyboard frame 3 is unclear because any  form of a pop song will not be license free--"Does Anybody Really Know What  Time It Is?" - Chicago.  Time seems to be the story theme of the video and the  phrase "Do you know what time it is?...Do you care?" is used with the 9-11  shots.  So I guess the question here is, do you want contractor to find license- free music or do you want them to use pop music that people would be familiar  with and pay for it? A.  The reference to Chicago is not set in stone.  We+d prefer to use license- free music, so contractor may adjust music selection accordingly.   6.  Q.  Pages 22, 23 + 24 of the “7 Seconds” storyboard refer to “stock  footage” inside a jet cockpit, including a warning light going off and the  pilot taking counter measures. Again, something so specific may not be  available as stock footage. Does this mean that:  this footage can be “generic” and enhanced with computer graphics and sound  effects to achieve the desired effect this footage exists somewhere else other  than a stock footage house and we can have access to it or that it is  potentially new footage that needs to be shot in a jet simulator cockpit? A.  NASIC has existing "generic" footage for this portion of the storyboard,  however will require customization/manipulation to simulate alarms and voice  communications to/from control tower.    7. Q. In 3.0 Deliverables you request B-roll footage on DigiBeta and Dvcam and  stock footage and production elements on Dvcam. Since all footage in this  project is either stock footage, footage provided by NASIC, or footage we shoot  of the students, what is being referred to in the deliverable as “B-roll  footage”? A.  B-roll footage includes un-used full or partial sections of stock footage  and student section not in the final product.    8.  Q.  Are “extras” required for the classroom scene behind the primary actors? A.  Extras not required, but would be up to the contractor. 9. Q.  In the Q+A it states that “NASIC will produce and edit the  interview/commentaries of the script writers, committee members, and NASIC  employees and provide this to the contractor for inclusion in the DVD.” Please  clarify if the contractor is responsible in any way for either shooting or  editing the interview/commentaries or the behind the scenes sequence for the  DVD. If we are responsible for any of this content, is there a desired length  of the final pieces? A.  Contractor is responsible for shooting and editing the  interviews/commentaries with actors in the student portion of the video.   Desired length is approximately 2-3 minutes per actor for  interviews/commentaries.  NASIC will produce and edit the  interviews/commentaries with script writers, committee members, and NASIC  employees.    *************************************************************************** FA8601-04-T-0161 UPDATE, 8 SEP 04, QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS The following questions and answers are in regard to FA8601-04-T-0161 1.  Q.  In SOW Section 2.0 Production Delivery Details, do all these things  need to be provided with the proposal or will this follow after award of  contract?  (For example, the shooting locations, seven suitable actors, three  voice talents). A.  None of the things listed in Section 2.0 of the SOW should be submitted  with the proposal.   2.  Q.  What are the travel possibilities? A.  Travel should be quite limited and may not be necessary at all.   3.  Regarding audio sound bites: Q.  Are they meant to be audio versions of “stock footage,” where contractor  needs to find specific voice actualities from historic speeches?  If so, does  Gov’t have approximate dates when these comments were made?  Were they  recorded, or did they only appear in print?  The following quotes (Page 11 and  14) were not attributed to anyone in the script we reviewed:  “Every American  is an enemy to us” (Osama Bin Laden?); “War with the United States is  inevitable.  We cannot avoid it.”  Is that said by a foreign leader?  If so,  who, and as with the other quotes, do we need to find a voice actuality of it?   If not, are these clips to be read by a narrator, or perhaps by an actor or  narrator with a foreign accent (or several different actors)? A.  The last option is probably the best.  Finding actual sound bites might be  very tough and is not required by the Statement of Work.  However, the Gov’t  does not want to dictate how the contractor to handle this issue.     4.  Q.  Willl the source of these quotations be identified in some way, such as  text on the screen? A.  They could be added in text but this isn’t required by the Statement of  Work.  This is up to the contractor.   5.  Q.  One sound bite appears to be an oath of office by a president.  Do you  want an actual news sound bite?  If so, which president? A.  This sound bite is the same as anyone who gives the oath to protect the  country, i.e., military oath. 6.  Q.  What is the anticipated shelf life of this project? A.  Approximately 2 to 3 years max. 7.  Q.  What is the intended distribution or audience for this project?  Who is  the intended audience? A.  18 to 24 year olds and slightly above…students, recent grads, ROTC, USAF  Academy Cadets, general public 8.  Q.  Can we use appropriate mixes of production library music, or do we need  to commission an original music score? A.  Production music is fine; however, the Gov’t does not want to dictate how  the contractor handles this issue. 9.  Q.  How long are the “Special Features” segments for which the contractor  is responsible?  (A.  Interviews/commentaries by actors, and B.  Behind-the- scenes location shoot and editing) A.  The contractor would shoot the actors while on the set.  NASIC will edit  the videos here and provide several pieces for inclusion on the DVD.   10.  Q.  For behind the scenes shots of the production portions, can we use a  handheld mini-DV camera?  Should we use Digital Betacam for the more formal  interviews, or do you prefer the more informal, behind-the scenes approach that  the mini DV brings? A.  DV would be fine; however, that is up to the contractor to decide. 11.  Q.  The jet pilot attack scene (pages 22-24) is to be a stock shot of a  fighter jet cockpit, with actors voicing the dialogue between the pilot and the  ACC.  In other words, no effort will be made to shoot a specific video scene  for this? A.  Correct, stock footage will be used.   12.  Q.  The NASIC-in-action shots on page 18 are to be stock footage.  Does  the military have relevant footage for this type on file that the contractor  could access? A.  NASIC will provide the in-house footage for page 18. 13.  Q.  What is the specific purpose of this production? A.  To show college students, cadets and the general public the nature of  threats to our country and the critical role that NASIC plays in identifying,  understanding and deterring those threats. *************************************************************************** FA8601-04-T-0161 UPDATE,  2 SEP 04, QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS The following questions and answers are in regard to FA8601-04-T-0161.   1.  Q.  In paragraph 2.5 of the Statement of Work (SOW), concerning stock video  footage, are there some pages missing from the list?  Is contractor to provide  stock video footage? A.  Clarification of paragraph 2.5:  The pages listed in paragraph 2.5 of the  SOW (pages 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, and 24) are those  for which the contractor must acquire stock video footage.  Contractor must  acquire the location for use when filming scene on page 15.  NASIC has stock  footage available for contractor use for pages 11, 13, 14, and 20.    2.  Q.  Are SECRET security clearances required? A.  No, it it unlikely that contractors would need access to the National Air  and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) during the production of this video.  A  SECRET clearance is not required to submit a quote or to be awarded a contract  for this project.  Paragraph 5.3 of the SOW will be revised to reflect this  change and a revision will be posted to this web site.   3.  Q.  Is all taping to take place at Wright-Patterson AFB? A.  Not necessarily.  Per SOW paragraph 2.1, the contractor is to recommend at  least three locations. 4.  Q.  How should price quotation be broken down – itemized or a lump sum? A.  Price quotation should be a lump sum that covers all services/materials  associated with this project. 5.  Q.  In paragraph 2.10 of the SOW, it describes a DVD review disk.  Is  contractor to produce this also? A.  Yes, contractor is to produce the DVD review disk.  NASIC will produce and  edit the interview/commentaries of the script writers,committee members,  and  NASIC employees and provide this to the contractor for inclusion in the DVD. 6.  Q.  Para 2.8 of the SOW concerning animation, are NASIC shield and USAF  logo to be animated in 2D or 3D? A.  Animation should be 3D. 7.  Q.  Para 2.10 of the SOW, the requirement for an active web link requires a  DVD-ROM master which limits your playback universe.  Does NASIC want a DVD or  DVD-ROM? A.  NASIC wants a DVD.  8.  Q.  Para 2.11, Replication and Packaging:  What are the packaging  requirements? A.  Packaging should be mailable by the USPS, but attractive and easy to take  hundreds to various locations (schools, trade shows, etc.).  Also, in para 3.0  of the SOW, it states that DVD replication disks should be in 4 color packaging. 9.  Q.  With the delivery date 12 weeks after the award of the contract, do you  have a projection as to when you will be awarding the contract? A.  It is our intent to award a contract mid-late Sep 04.   10.  Q.  Para 1.1.6 of the SOW, meetings are to be held between NASIC rep and  the PM.  Can these meetings be held via phone or do they have to be face-to- face? A.  Meetings can be held via phone. 11.  Q.  Para 2.3, Are costumes for talent provided by the Air Force? A.  No, all costumes will be contractor-provided. 12.  Q. Para 2.15, the first two clauses seem to be in conflict in regard to  production footage. Clarification requested. A.

<DESC>This is amendment 0003 to this solicitation. Further questions with answers are posted under this amendment.  29. Q: The contractor is being asked to ”provide analytical, technical, functional, administrative and management support to the GIG Operations Continuity Planning Office (GO52).”  Would a Firm Fixed Price level of effort (LOE) offer for labor categories and hours be considered a legitimate FFP offer? A: The solicitation requires a Firm Fixed Price for each CLIN at the CLIN level for a one-year period of performance.

30. Q: Can our team get a copy of the current DISA Headquarters COOP plan, softcopy most desirable?  A: The document is classified. Access to the plan is not required to respond to this solicitation.

31. Q: Request of list of “DISA-wide” facilities, number of personnel (civilian, military and contractor), and a very brief description of the function(s) performed at each site. A: The information requested is classified. Access to the information is not required to respond to this solicition.

32. Q: Can we obtain a technical and functional description of the Dialogic Communicator®? A: The information can be found on the company’s website.

33. Q: “Maintaining Emergency Relocation Group Data with a DISA approved format.”  Is an Excel spread sheet format acceptable or is a relational database required for this data?  A: DISA uses MS Word office products and a product that is interchangeable with that format is acceptable.

34. Q: Task 2.8 requires the contractor to assist with the “installation of DISA procured assets at the alternate site(s)”.  Approximately how many sites and what is their relative location to the NCR?  A: The number of sites and their locations are classified. Most of the sites are with several hours driving of the NCR.

35. Q: Task 3 (optional) is for Alternate Site Management to include selection, design, renovation, capabilities upgrade, and maintenance oversight and operation of the site.  How many sites are anticipated and what is the geographical relationship to headquarters. A: The exact number of sites is classified. The sites already exist and most of the sites are within driving distance of the NCR.

36. Q: Task 4 (Optional) Agency Element Support may require a wide variety of personnel skills and knowledge based on the situation.  I propose we look as labor categories and specialties of personnel who can be applied to specific organizational functions.  Examples are Program Management, Portfolio Management Oversight, Budget & Finance, Strategic Planning, Security Specialist (physical and IT).  These subject matter experts will be available on the contract at a FFP based on their level of S&K, training and education, and experience level.  Sample levels of expertise are Administrative Assistant (1&2), Management Consultant (1-4), Senior Management Consultant, Principal Management Consultant (1&2), Executive Management Consultant (1&2), Senior Executive Management Consultant.  These are MOBIS labor categories and fit nicely into the description of the type of work that may be required.  A description of how we would define the requirements and hire the right person for the position would be in order.  Do you think this would be an acceptable approach for task 4?  A: You may prepare your proposal however you like. The evaluation criteria of the proposals will be as stated in this solicitation.  37. Q: Do you want the past performance information signed? A: It is not required that the past performance information be signed. It is required that the proposal be signed, and that a scan of the signature be attached to the email submittal of the proposal.

Statement of Work:   The contractor shall obtain a digging permit upon notification of contract award and prior to commencement of work.  Digging permits are available from the Civil Engineer project manager Janie Schultz or Seth Foulkes.  Contractor shall remove concrete slabs, concrete fence post footings and trees north of the base perimeter fence line behind Jasmine Avenue at Altus AFB, Oklahoma.  The fence line work is approximately 2400 linear feet from the North Gate access to the flood canal at Command Circle/Jasmine Avenue. The current fence IDIQ contractor working on the removal and installation of a new perimeter fence is at a work stoppage pending completion of this requirement.  There are approximately 80 trees all varying in height from approximately 4 feet tall to 25 feet tall.  The contractor is required to remove only those trees along the fence line 5 feet south of the perimeter fence to 5 feet north of the perimeter fence line.  The trees to be removed will be identified with a tag by the government and private property owner(s).  Any tree stumps remaining are to be grinded to a below ground depth of 18 to 20 inches.   4-5 concrete slabs measuring approximately 5-6 square feet are to be removed from the flood canal along the perimeter.  The canal width is approximately 5-10 feet in width at the slab location.  The contractor shall replace the broken concrete slabs with rip-rap granite; each piece approximately 10-18 inches in diameter as fill-in for erosion prevention for those slabs removed.   There are approximately 15 concrete fence post footings to be removed.  These footings are not to be confused with the footings in place that have fence posts attached.  The footings to be removed are located near the canal end of the fence line and run west along the perimeter.  These footings will be located between the existing fence posts.  The concrete footings are approximately 8 inches in diameter and about 36 inches deep.  Backfill is not required for the holes left from the removal of the footings.  The contractor shall take precaution not to damage/disrupt the underground utility cables that are in proximity of the work to be conducted.  Any damages to surrounding landscaping, grass, shrubbery, etc. caused by movement of vehicles for the removal of disposal material from the site or similar damage from other types of vehicles and/or equipment shall be repaired and restored back to its original condition before the work on this project will be considered complete.  This includes any damages to the private land owner property along the fence perimeter.  Contractor clean-up shall be continuous on a daily basis.  Contractor shall remove and dispose of the afore mentioned materials to an approved landfill in accordance with environmental, local, federal and state laws and regulations. The period of performance for this project is not to exceed 10 working days from the notice to proceed.  Inclement weather is an excuseable delay in order to prevent unnecessary damages to the land owner and government property.  The Contracting Officer shall be the only individual to determine if work is to be delayed.   Contractor shall submit a signed single line item lump sum proposal for the entire project to the contracting POC identified above.  The site visit is highly encouraged, but not mandatory. The magnitude of this project is estimated to be less than $30K.

INTRODUCTION

This Contract is for Advisory and Assistance Services by non-governmental sources in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 37 – Service Contracting and Part 15--Negotiated Contracts, Subject to availability of funds.

B.l		Summary

B.1.1		USTDA is funding a Conference for the Information and Communications Sector for Southeast Asian countries, which will take place in Bangkok, Thailand in March 2005.  USTDA seeks to contract with a U.S. firm (Contractor) to research and write the Briefing Book for the conference.  The Contractor will propose a team with technical and business expertise in the communications infrastructure sector.  

B.1.2.		With the support of several U.S. government agencies, the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) is planning a conference that will highlight issues and opportunities in the information and communications sector for Southeast Asian countries.  

The Conference will tentatively be held over two-and-a-half days in March 2005, in Bangkok, Thailand.  For bid preparation purposes, this timeframe and location should be assumed. 

While Southeast Asian economies continue to struggle to bring affordable telecommunications services to its citizens, particularly in rural and remote areas, advances in technology and greater infrastructure affordability have paved the way for strong communications and information technology network growth, particularly through the use of wireless solutions.  New technologies in this sector have not only expanded telephony in many developing countries, but have also provided customers access to a wireless data services platform that is advancing mobile e-commerce.  

Significant opportunities for U.S. information and communications equipment vendors and service operators exist in Southeast Asia despite differing levels of development throughout the region.  The conference would focus on market opportunities in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam.  Special emphasis will be placed on sector development and policy issues in East Timor, Laos, Cambodia, and Papua New Guinea (only private sector participants will be considered from Cambodia).  Singapore and Brunei would be given observer status, due to their regional location and importance.

Topics which could be addressed during the conference include:

·	Regulatory Landscape 
·	Universal Service;
·	Standards (how to manage a multi-standard environment); and
·	Spectrum Management.

The agenda will be designed with these objectives in mind.  Offerors shall provide a draft agenda reflecting the conference objectives as part of the bid.

The conference will bring together public and private sector project sponsors and information and communications sector government leaders from the national, state, and municipal levels in the participating countries, as well as a range of U.S. equipment suppliers and service providers catering to this industry.  In preparing the bid for this conference, offerors should consider industry competitiveness and the targeted U.S. company audience for the event.  

We are targeting approximately 175 U.S. and foreign participants, with at least 50 U.S. company representatives and approximately 40 project delegates from the participating countries.  The conference will aim to balance policy and project objectives, and will feature one-on-one meetings, project presentations, and panel/roundtable discussions.


B.1.3.	As the technical expert responsible for the overall substance of the Conference, the Contractor shall perform the following primary tasks: 
1.	Prepare a Briefing Book.of country and sector overviews and at least 30 detailed project descriptions for projects to be presented at the Conference;

3.	Identification of project sponsors, speakers, and other special guests to be invited to the Conference;
4.	Assist USTDA and the logistical conference contractor to develop a detailed, substantive agenda for the conference; and 
5.	Attend the Conference to facilitate with the agenda and the interaction between Conference attendees.

B.1.4		A separate logistics contractor will be hired to organize the logistics and execute the conference.  The Briefing Book Contractor and the logistical conference contractor will be required to coordinate and cooperate with each other to successfully perform this work.

B.2.3	The Contractor may invoice for up to 25% of the total contract price upon meeting with USTDA and the logistical contractor for a kickoff meeting and submittal to and acceptance of a workplan for the research and travel.  

The Contractor may invoice for up to 25% of the total contract price upon submittal to and acceptance by USTDA of:
