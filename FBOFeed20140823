<DESC>NSN 7H-7025-014645923, TDP VER 005, REF NR B438, QTY 24 EA, DELIVERY FOB ORIGIN. Lockheed Martin is the design agent, system integrator and the NAVSEA approved source of supply and certified depot for the AN/UYQ-70(V) weapon system. NAVSUP WSS does not possess the necessary engineering drawing masters, developmental specifications, engineering change data, interface specifications,
etc. required to source these parts to another vendor other than Lockheed Martin. NAVSUP WSS does not have required Navy technical support activity (TSA) or in-service engineering support approval to parts procured or repaired by sources other than Lockheed Martin. Data is not currently available for competition. Lockheed Martin provided detailed analysis and justification for value-added parts which was reviewed by the AN/UYQ-70(V) host ISEA community. This review was performed to see if parts could be properly broken out without negatively impacting host weapon system certification, configuration management and operating systems. The review revealed that the Government does not possess the in-depth technical knowledge; or the required technical documentation; or it
is not up-to-date; or it is incomplete in content for full and open competition.
Configuration control of commercial parts is insufficient when purchase from sources other than the Q-70 system integrator. The integrator has the necessary operational, design, configuration management, integration and engineering knowledge when purchasing, building and repairing Q-70 parts for hosted systems.

Indian means a person who is a member of an Indian Tribe or Native as defined in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203; 85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601). Indian Economic Enterprise means any business activity owned by one or more Indians or Indian Tribes that is established for the purpose of profit, provided that: (i) The combined Indian or Indian Tribe ownership shall constitute not less than 51 percent of the enterprise; (ii) the Indians or Indian Tribes shall, together, receive at least a majority of the earnings from the contract; and (iii) the management and daily business operations of an Indian economic enterprise must be controlled by one or more individuals who are members of an Indian Tribe.

The enterprise must meet these requirements throughout the following time periods: (1) At the time an offer is made in response to a written solicitation; (2) At the time of contract award; and, (3) During the full term of the contract. Indian Tribe means an Indian Tribe, band, nation, or other recognized group or community which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians, including any Alaska Native village, regional or village corporation established under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203, 85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601). Representation means the positive statement by an enterprise of its eligibility for preferential consideration and participation for acquisitions conducted under the Buy Indian Act, 25 U.S.C. 47, in accordance with the procedures in Subpart 1480.8.

Indian Economic Enterprise means any business activity owned by one or more Indians or Indian Tribes that is established for the purpose of profit, provided that: (i) The combined Indian or Indian Tribe ownership shall constitute not less than 51 percent of the enterprise; (ii) the Indians or Indian Tribes shall, together, receive at least a majority of the earnings from the contract; and (iii) the management and daily business operations of an Indian economic enterprise must be controlled by one or more individuals who are members of an Indian Tribe.

The enterprise must meet these requirements throughout the following time periods: (1) At the time an offer is made in response to a written solicitation; (2) At the time of contract award; and, (3) During the full term of the contract. Indian Tribe means an Indian Tribe, band, nation, or other recognized group or community which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians, including any Alaska Native village, regional or village corporation established under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203, 85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601). Representation means the positive statement by an enterprise of its eligibility for preferential consideration and participation for acquisitions conducted under the Buy Indian Act, 25 U.S.C. 47, in accordance with the procedures in Subpart 1480.8.

<p>Offeror shall list exception(s) and rationale for the exception(s)</p>
<p>Note: This procurement is not being conducted under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program or another Government-Wide Area Contract (GWAC). If an offeror submits a quotation based upon an FSS or GWAC contract, the Government will accept the quoted price. However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the offeror's FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation.</p>
<p>QUOTATION EVALUATION</p>
<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, represents the best value to the Government, price and non-price factors considered.</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on relative importance of the following factors in descending order:</p>
<p>Factor 1: Technical Solution:<br />Evaluation of the technical solution will focus on the Offeror's demonstrated understanding of the requirements, the Offeror's proposed technical and management approaches to meeting the requirements, including its implementation plans and processes and to satisfy these requirements, and any innovative approaches. The Offeror's Technical solution will be evaluated based on the assessed strengths, weaknesses, deficiencies, uncertainties and risks of each Offeror's proposed technical solution.</p>
<p>Factor 2) Key Personnel: <br />The Government will evaluate the extent to which the resumes submitted for the offeror's proposed key personnel demonstrate they have appropriate education, qualifications, and experience, to efficiently and effectively manage and perform the requirements and ensure the technical quality of deliverables.</p>
<p>Factor 3) Experience: <br />The Government will evaluate the extent of the offeror's experience providing similar services. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate they have experience delivering the same type of services they are proposing for the current requirement. An offeror without a history of relevant experience may receive a lowered rating for the Key Personnel/Experience Factor.<br />The Government will evaluate the degree of comparability of each Offeror's past projects relevant to this acquisition, in particular, their experience in developing, implementing interoperability testing/certification plans related to smart grid, and knowledge and familiarity with SGIP and this organization's Testing and Certification Committee, Priority Action Plans (PAPs), and its processes and activities. In addition, a resume and copies of industry awards, certificates, and letters of recommendation should be submitted.</p>
<p>Factor 4) Past Performance:<br />The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past three years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate, as appropriate, successful performance of contract requirements, quality and timeliness of delivery of goods and services, cost management, communications between contracting parties, proactive management and customer satisfaction.. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>
<p>NOTE - If an offeror does not have a history of relevant contract experience, or if past performance information is not available, the offeror will receive a neutral past performance rating; however, an offeror without a history of relevant experience may receive a lowered rating for the Experience Factor.</p>
<p>Factor 3: Evaluated Cost/Price</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the reasonableness of the Offeror's proposed pricing over the life of the contract of each acceptable offer in relation to other acceptable offers.</p>
<p>Basis for Award<br />The Contracting Officer intends on awarding without discussions. A quotation will only be considered technically acceptable if it clearly demonstrates compliance with this solicitation. All evaluation factors other than price both individual and when combined, are considered more important than price. However, the Government will not select an offeror for award on the basis of technical merit without concern and consideration of its price. The degree of importance of price as an evaluation factor will increase with the degree of equality in the technical merits of the proposals.<br />1352.233-70 AGENCY PROTESTS (APR 2010)<br /><br />(a) An agency protest may be filed with either: (1) the contracting officer, or (2) at a level above the contracting officer, with the appropriate agency Protest Decision Authority.

<p>Line Item 0001: one (1) 1064 pulsed laser 40 Watts with Repetition rate from 10 kHz down to single shot and power supply</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK:</p>
<p>1. Background<br />2. The mission of the Quantum Electronics and Photonics Division (Div 686) is to provide industry, and its suppliers and customers, with comprehensive and technically advanced measurement capabilities and standards, as well as traceability to those standards. An IMS program on the "Detection of Corrosion Products on Rebar" and a division funded intramural research program on "Chirped Pulse THz Analysis of Fragmentation Products for Astronomy &amp; Biophysics" has major measurement challenges in the development and validation of a THz chirped-pulse system to monitor and quantify the fragmentation products of large or heavy molecules of interest in corrosion, astronomy and biophysics. This high-repetition-rate 1064 nm ablation laser will be used to generate the fragmentation products at rates well-matched to the scan rate of the chirped-pulse THz system.<br />3. Objectives/Scope<br />4. The high scan rate capability of the THz chirped pulse system requires the development of new technologies for the generation of ions, radicals and products from fragmentation of solid state samples for rapid detection in the gas phase. The high-repetition-rate 1064 nm laser will allow for significant improvements in detection sensitivity of ablated products and can be utilized to advance metrology for many applications. Much like standard techniques based on mass spectrometric detection like MALDI and electro-spray ionization, the system will be used to develop a new method for detection of non-volatile samples by detection of fragments following ablation from solid samples. The unique properties of this system is 100% speciation given the spectral fingerprints of the products. We have determined that we cannot compromise on these specification or the experiment cannot be completed. Below, we have justified why each spec is necessary for our experiment. The specifications needed and our justifications (in red) for our experiment are as follows:<br />1. We need a variable repetition rate laser operating from single shot to 100 kHz repetition rate. The laser wavelength should be at 1064 nm +/- 100 nm - We require variable repetition rate to enable the laser ablation of materials across two different types of experiments including the generation of a quasi-continuous-wave molecular beam from an effusive source to single shot generation at repetition rates as low as 1 Hz from a pulse discharge nozzle.<br />2. The pulse energy is a minimum of 2 mJ per laser pulse and should be independent of repetition rate of the laser - We require a minimum of 2 mJ per laser pulse to provide enough ablated material to detect using the THz chirped pulse system.<br />3. The pulse temporal width should range from 5 ns to 30 ns and should be independent of repetition rate of the laser - We require a variable pulse widths to optimize the quantity and type of material that is ablated.<br />4. The quality of the laser beam profile should have an M2 &lt; 2 - We require a well-shaped output beam to permit tight focusing onto the surface containing the material to be ablated.<br />5. The laser pulse timing should be controlled with a user input electric pulse at the ns level - We require synchronization with other instrumentation to optimize the detection of ablated products.</p>
<p>Delivery<br />The schedule for delivery is anticipated within 8-10 weeks after the receipt of the award. Quotes must include delivery date ARO for the proposed equipment.</p>

<DESC>Statement of Work<br />Analysis of photoquadrat images for marine seafloor and benthic biological communities
<p>Background<br />The National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) conducts science to support ocean planning and place-based management. NCCOS conducts biological and ecological assessments of the coastal ocean to provide coastal managers and regulatory agencies with data to support decision making.<br />NCCOS conducted a research cruise in a proposed wind energy development area and collected 850 digital images (i.e.,photoquadrats) of the seafloor . Analyses of the photographs provide indicators of the benthic biological and sessile communities and assist with interpretation of sensitive habitats that support economic and ecological important fish and invertebrate in the coastal ocean.</p>
<p>Specific Requirements<br />NCCOS requires services to analyze 850 digital images taken of benthic biological and sedimentary characteristics. Digital images will be provided to the awardee on hard drive or flash drive. Images were taken using underwater digital cameras operated by divers, capturing a quadrat that measured 0.25m x 0.25m. Analysis will be performed using computer-aided image analysis methods involving either manual point count/identification, semi-automated or unsupervised-automated computer software.<br />Output from each photograph will include measures of percent cover of unconsolidated sediments and classes of biological organisms including algae, sponges, corals and invertebrates. Biological organisms will be identified to the lowest possible taxa (species when possible). Delivered output will be in Excel spreadsheet or Access database format and provided as a digital file delivered electronically, on CD, hard drive or flash drive. Returned images will show points relevant to identification of organisms or benthic seafloor type (if unconsolidated sediment).</p>
<p>Contractor needs to have experience with computer-assisted analysis of digital images such as CPCE and expertise in the identification of benthic organisms in North Carolina hard bottom communities.</p>
<p>IT Security Requirements</p>
<p>The Certification and Accreditation (C&amp;A) or Assessment and Authentication (A&amp;A) requirements of Clause 48 CFR 1352.239-72 do not apply, and a Security Accreditation Package is not required.</p>
<p>The contractor will not have access to any government owned equipment or be furnished government privileged information. The contractor will be developing and documenting information and images obtained during the performance of this contract.</p>
<p>Restrictions Against Disclosure</p>
<p>The contractor agrees, in the performance of this contract, to keep the information furnished by the Government and designated by the Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer's Technical Representative in the strictest confidence . The contractor also agree not to publish or otherwise divulge such information in whole or part, in any manner or form, nor to authorize or permit others to do so, taking such reasonable measures as are necessary to restrict access to such information while in the contractor's possession, to those employees needing such information to perform the work provided herein, i.e., on a "need to know" basis. The contractor agrees to immediately notify the Contracting Officer in writing in the event that the contractor determines or has reason to suspect a breach of this requirement.</p>
<p>The contractor agrees that it will not disclose any information described in performance of this activity to any persons or individual unless prior written approval is obtained from the Contracting Officer. Whenever the<br />Contractor is uncertain with regard to the proper handling of information/data under the contract, the contractor<br />shall obtain a written determination from the Contracting Officer. The Contractor agrees to insert the substance <br />of this clause in any consultant agreement or subcontract hereunder.</p>

R  District III Tribal Court Review service for the Department of the Interior (DOI), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Office of Justice Services (OJS), Division of Tribal Justice Support. Alaska Tribal Court Code Writing and Court Procedure Development and Training service.
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only notice; Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation is issued. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  The North American Industry classification (NAICS) code is 541199.
This acquisition is being solicited in accordance with FAR Part 13.003 and DIAR 1480.504-1, as a total Indian Economic Enterprise Set-aside. The Period of Performance (POP) shall be proposed. See the PWS for complete performance requirement details. The resultant contract will be awarded as a firm fixed-price contract as defined in FAR 16.2. The Government intends to make a single contract award. Due to the urgent need, the response period and proposal due date is shortened. See the complete solicitation for details.
BACKGROUND
The mission of the Office of Tribal Justice Support (TJS), a division within the Office of Justice Services (OJS), Department of the Interior (DOI), is to further the development, operation, and enhancement of tribal justice systems and the Courts of Indian Offenses.  Congress and the Federal courts have repeatedly recognized that tribal justice systems are the appropriate forum for adjudicating tribal civil disputes and addressing criminal activity relative to Indian tribes, bands, nations, pueblos, or other organized groups or communities, including any Alaska Native entity. TJS is statutorily tasked with providing training and technical assistance to tribal courts and judicial services pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3602 et seq., and has, historically, included Alaska tribes and villages in training and technical assistance programs.  
During two visits to Alaska, a need for training and technical assistance in developing statutory provisions as well as substantive and procedural codes that establish or improve court functions was identified as a priority.  Code development was identified as essential to beginning the process of enhancing and developing strong Native judicial systems in Alaska tribal communities and villages.  A natural mechanism for outreach and delivery of training and technical assistance programs was identified, in that, tribes and villages are divided into six (6) regions (attachment A), and within each region is an organization representing the interests of  a consortium, or confederation of tribes and villages.  
Alaska is a Public Law 280 State with at least 60 tribes and villages operating formal civil courts and asserting jurisdiction over juvenile justice, domestic violence, child protection and elder protection within their communities.  The need to proliferate strong legislative writing and procedural skills is a critical first step to establishing new courts and enhancing the functions of those already operating.  The development of training and technical assistance program devoted to code development that uses a train the trainer model will create an Alaska Native human resource accessible to all tribal communities and villages throughout the State. 
SCOPE AND PURPOSE
The purpose of the Alaska Tribal Code Writing and Court Procedure Development Project is to provide access to court related, substantive and procedural, code development skills to Alaska Native tribes and villages. Teaching legislative writing and procedural development skills, and providing back-up support for reviewing and making recommendations regarding written codes is a function that could be shared throughout Alaskas Native communities by focusing initially on statutes that either establish court functions or enhance those already in place.  
The project focus will be to proliferate code writing skills and procedural development expertise and increase access to those skills and expertise throughout each region in Alaska. The project will give the villages and tribes the tools to either establish codes needed to establish judicial systems and court processes or to enhance existing ones. Training and technical assistance programs shall be designed to meet common, code development needs.
Code writing and development skills taught in a train the trainer format will create a skilled human resource pool that may, in the future, be utilized and proliferated as expertise in general code writing and procedural development. Those who train in the OJS sponsored train the trainer programs will be certified to assist other villages and tribal communities within their region in developing and enhancing codes that are unique both to the needs of the tribe or village and to the region.

R - District III Tribal Court Review service for the Department of the Interior (DOI), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Office of Justice Services (OJS), Division of Tribal Justice Support. 
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only notice; Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation is issued. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  The North American Industry classification (NAICS) code is 541199.
This acquisition is being solicited accordance with FAR Part 13.003 and DIAR 1480.504-1, as a total Indian Economic Enterprise Set-aside. The Period of Performance (POP) shall be 12 months. See the SOW for complete performance requirement details. The resultant contract will be awarded as a firm fixed-price contract as defined in FAR 16.2. The Government intends to make a single contract award. Due to the urgent need, the response period and proposal due date is shortened. See the complete solicitation for details.
BACKGROUND The mission of the Office  of Tribal Justice Support (TJS), a division within the Office of Justice Services (OJS), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) , Department of the Interior (DOI) is to further the development, operation, and enhancement of tribal justice systems and Courts of Indian Offenses. Congress and the Federal courts have repeatedly recognized that tribal justice systems are the appropriate forum for adjudicating civil disputes and some limited criminal actions within Indian country. Most recently, Congress has enlarged the criminal jurisdiction of tribal courts under the Tribal Law and Order Act and the Violence Against Women Re-Authorization Act.  To that end, TJS is mandated to provide training, technical assistance and limited funding to tribal justice systems. In an effort to assist tribal justice system to administered justice fairly and with the utmost integrity, one of TJS's tasks is to perform tribal court assessments intended to assist in defining specific technical assistance and training needed by tribal courts, 25 U.S.C. 3612 (2000).
Tribal Court Assessments can assist TJS in focusing on the universal needs of tribal justice systems as well as the specific individualized needs of particular tribal courts and thus these assessments are intended to provide areas of training and technical assistance in matters such as criminal prosecution, foster care issues-including IV-E issues, Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) issues, juvenile issues, guardianship issues, tribal probate issues, tort and liability issues which occur on Indian lands and are regulated by tribal codes. TJS has determined that the tribal court assessments will be based on the Trial Court Performance Standards (TCPS) model which defines optimal court performance and are viewed as a blueprint for improving the administration of justice by focusing on performance, self-assessment and self-improvement of the trial justice system. 
In addition to providing guidance for TJS on appropriate training, these tribal court assessments provide a conceptual framework of performance areas, community perception, standards and measures and focus on tribal courts operational activities, codes, procedures, and budget limitations Moreover, the tribal court assessments are often a basis of one-time funding decisions made by TJS. Finally, TJS is charged with maintaining an information clearinghouse on tribal justice systems and Courts of Indian Offenses. These reviews provide a detailed court profile data base for the creation of a clearing house that will include tribal codes, judicial decisions and court profiles.
GENERAL REQUIREMENTS The Office of Tribal Justice Support is seeking a contractor to conduct Tribal Court Assessments for Tribal Court located in OJS District 3.  The Contractor shall work closely with the TJS, the Associate Director as well as the National Tribal Court Review Coordinator, whose role and focus is to assist in coordinating the reviews, and review the documents for consistency based on the standards set forth in the TCPS and by TJS. 
The Contractor shall have experience working in and for tribal court(s).  The Contractor shall be available to travel to the tribal courts located within the OJS District 3.  It is of particular importance that travel expenses are minimized during all phases in the preparation of court reviews, corrective action plans, and the delivery of a proposal of additional training and technical assistance.
The Contractor shall conduct an assessment in coordination with a review team in five separate phases. The first phase will be an initial one-day visit to the Tribe to gather documents and discuss the process with the tribal government and tribal court staff,  thereafter the second phase shall require the contractor and team to return to the Tribal Court  for a three to four day tribal court assessment. The third phase will be to draft the final assessment and submit the draft to TJS.  Once the assessment is accepted in final form by the Office of Tribal Justice Support, the fourth phase will consist of the contractor and team returning a third time to the Tribe to present the assessment, findings and address any other issues pertinent to the final presentation.  The fifth and final stage will be to ensure the tribal court has been informed of all the training and technical assistance available and to ensure that if possible additional one time funding has been provided to the tribal justice system.  The fifth stage includes incorporating a recommendation section within the assessment which may be used as a guide for a tribal court strategic action plan.  
In addition, the Contractor and team shall attend at least 3 of the 4 in-service trainings sponsored by TJS throughout the year.
