<DESC><p>In accordance with FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to issue a sole-source award to Healthy Housing Solutions, National Center for Healthy Housing, 10320 Little Patuxent Parkway, Suite 500, Columbia, MD for National Lead Poisoning Prevention Training Center contract. As a leader in the Lead Poisoning Prevention field at the local and national level, Healthy Housing Solutions possess the necessary link of having expertise in providing HUD approved healthy housing training to health and housing professionals.
<p>The Lead Contamination Control Act of 1988 authorized the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to initiate program efforts to eliminate childhood lead poisoning in the United States. As a result of this Act, the CDC Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Branch was created, with primary responsibility to develop programs and policies to prevent childhood lead poisoning. Also, to educate the public and health-care providers about childhood lead poisoning.</p>
<p>CDC has a need to provide training and education to public health practitioners working in state and local childhood lead poisoning prevention programs. Staffing changes at the state and local government levels in many health programs have placed new staff into Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Programs (CLPPP) who are inexperienced in lead programming or other aspects of the CLPPP essential to their position. The education and training provided through this procurement will enhance the ability of new staff to deliver quality CLPPPs in their state and local jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The nature of this action is to provide programmatic training to CDC grantees that will lead to the reducing and elimination of the number of children with elevated blood lead levels within their communities. It is also to provide basic instruction as to properly operating a childhood lead poisoning program, and executing program techniques and methods that intervene in the exposure to lead hazards and conditions.</p>
<p>This is a only a&nbsp;synopsis. An official solicitation will be subsequently issued directly based upon this Notice of Intent. Interested parties who feel that they possess the capabilities to provide the services described above should submit capability statement/qualifications demonstrating their abilities to provide the services outlined in the attached Statement of Work. The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. All responses shall be submitted via email to MEAllen@cdc.gov with the reference number (2009-64285- National Lead Poisoning Prevention Training) referenced in the subject line no-later-than 3:30 PM Eastern Time, January 15, 2009. Documentation should be received within fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by CDC. A determination by the CDC not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within discretion on of the Government</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  
It is the intent of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to issue a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Michale Michalec 18140 Chalet Drive #204, Germantown, MD 20874 to provide basic research services to the HCGS-NIDCR. The vendor will provide the following services:
	participate in ongoing research related to identification of the genetic basis of Hereditary Gingival Fibromatosis, Amelogenesis Imperfecta and Dentinogenesis Imperfecta and characterization of the functional defect that causes these diseases.  Specifically the contractor will prepare specimens for DNA extraction, cell culture and immunohistochemistry;
	perform genotyping and linkage analysis of appropriate families; 
	sequence and analyze candidate genes; 
	perform functional characterization of genes/proteins identified as potentially disease-causing.
	maintain clear and accurate records relating to experimental data.

The contractor must:

	have expertise in a variety of standard molecular genetic techniques and be able to work independently
	posses a background in genetics
	provide expertise in sequencing
	demonstrate expertise in annotation of the human genome, designing primers for PCR amplification of coding and noncoding genetic regions
	be experienced in identification of genetic mutations, SNPs deletions and copy number variants required
	maintain excellent oral communication skills and be able to participate in writing scientific reports

The sole source determination is based upon the fact that this vendor is already performing these services under a current purchase order, and at this time requires additional hours and funding to complete the SOW as outlined.  In order to maintain consistency of all DNA extractions, genotyping, linkage analysis as well as other characterizations for all of the experimental data it is critical to maintain work with the current vendor. This will allow NIH to benefit from the investment already made.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAVAIRWARCENWPNSDIV) intends to procure from Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC), on an other than full and open competition basis, engineering support services including: design, development, integration, test and distribution of Operational Flight Programs to the Fleet; EA-6B and EG-18G upgrade support; flight test and aircraft integration; and support to transition the EA-6B's mission to the EA-18G.  Programs to be supported under this contract include:  EA-6B, EA-18G and other advanced electronic attack derivatives.  These requirements will be provided within the Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) Integrated Product Team located at the NAVAIRWARCENWPNSDIV, Point Mugu, California.  
The period of performance for the proposed acquisition will commence upon award and will continue for a period of three years. Deliveries will be made free on board destination. It is anticipated that the proposed contract type will be Cost Plus Fixed Fee, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity, Level of Effort (LOE) with the inclusion of performance based task orders. The total required LOE is estimated to be 73,571 hours.  Performance of the task orders issued under this contract will be evaluated with the basic contract Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan, that identifies performance objectives, performance standards, acceptable quality level, inspection type and frequency, and remedies related to contractor performance.  
In accordance with FAR clause 6.302-1(b)(1)(i), NGC possesses unique services that are not available from any other source.  NGC is the sole designer, developer, and manufacturer of the EA-6B aircraft and the ICAP III on-going software products.  No other source has the capability to provide the required systems engineering, software development, integration, and testing efforts as described in the Performance Work Staement  associated with this proposed procurement.  Accordingly it is in the government's best interest to pursue an acquisition with NGC using other than full and open competition.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p>Task Order Title. This is a follow on procurement to purchase annual SAP MaxSecure Support Services for the period January 7, 2009 to January 6, 2010.
<p>Background. The Navy Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Program is an initiative to consolidate the four ex-isting Department of the Navy (DON) ERP pilots: SMART Naval Supply System Command (NAVSUP), SIGMA Naval Air System Command (NAVAIR), NEMAIS Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA), and CABRILLO Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) into a single system. This will provide standardization of (DON) processes, integrated enterprise solution to seamlessly support end-to-end capability, to provide accurate, consistent, timely financial information from a single source, and to manage and track costs drivers as an enterprise. Systems, Applications, and Products. (SAP) Public Services' Enterprise Resource Planning software suite is the core application utilized by all four pilot programs. In order to consolidate the pilot programs, Navy ERP has purchased and implemented the mySAP business suite software and "add-on" software. Currently, Navy ERP has deployed to NAVAIR and NAVSUP and is being deployed to SPAWAR in Oct 2009.</p>
<p>Objectives. The SAP MAXSecure is expected to provide the Navy ERP program with much more rapid response times to request for Support to SAP. The service will provide resources whose sole focus will be to understand the Navy ERP system and react to any issues related to the software affecting the production system. This will support the mission with respect to minimizing downtime and impacts to the user base for the Navy ERP enterprise business system. Other goals include assistance in standing up a certified Navy ERP SAP competency center and recommen-dations for improvements within the Navy ERP SAP system with regard to system performance. Navy ERP wishes to continue the support services for 12 months for the hours and type of support as listed under Scope. An additional option period is requested in the event additional services are required. Navy ERP requires this procurement to be incrementally funded.</p>

<DESC>THIS PROCUREMENT IS BEING ISSUED UNDER THE SMALL BUSINESS COMPETITIVENESS DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR SUBPART 19.10 AND WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION. The target ceiling for contract award for design and construction is $16,300,000.00. The Government cannot guarantee that additional funds can be made available for award. Offerors are under no obligation to approach this amount. This project is for the Design and Construction of a Hazardous Material Response Facility consisting of a laboratory, conference and general use space for the Pentagon Force Protection Agency at the Pentagon Reservation in Arlington, Virginia. 

The Design-Build process will have two distinct phases. Phase-I will be the pre-qualification process, where the Government will select 2 to 5 Design-Build Contractors on the basis of Project Organization and Personnel, Offeror's Experience and Resource Commitment, Management Control Systems, Past Performance, Management/Technical Compliance Certification, and Financial Capacity. The elements are listed in descending order of importance with Project Organization and Personnel being the most important and the remaining elements becoming increasingly less important.

Only the selected Design-Build Contractors will then qualify for the Phase-II of the process. In Phase-II of the procurement procedure, offerors will be given the opportunity to offer their preliminary design and cost proposals. Final selection and basis for award of the design-build contract will be on the basis of Qualifications, Technical Quality, Price, and Other Salient Factors considered being in the Government's best interests. The elements are listed in descending order of importance with Qualifications being the most important and the remaining elements becoming increasingly less important. This is not a low bid award project. If awarded the contract, the offeror shall complete the design and construction documents and construct the facility in compliance with these completed requirements. The building could be two stories and shall be sited to increase visibility and impact from the initial approach to the building. The Design/Build Contractor shall design the new building shall complement other structures in the area around the building. However, design and construction creativity and innovation is encouraged. 

Plans and Specifications will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Web Page at http://www.fbo.gov/. Offerors may register on the Interested Vendors List (IVL) at http://www.fbo.gov/ and retrieve an IVL from the same location. All technical inquiries and questions relating to this solicitation are to be submitted via e-mail to JoAnn Avants at joann.avants@whs.mil and Gregory Lindsey at gregory.lindsey.ctr@whs.mil. Compact disc and hardcopies will not be available. Offerors should check often for changes (Amendments). Issue date on or about January 15, 2009. Phase I of the Request for Proposal Due on or about February 15, 2009. The due date for Phase II of the Request for Proposal will be determined after evaluation/selections have been made for Phase I.

<a href="mailto:nicola.ohaegbu@us.army.mil">US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity</a>
<DESC>The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity proposes to award to Daylight Chemical Information Systems, 120 Vantis, Ste 550, Aliso Viejs, CA 92656 on a sole source basis for software maintenance, upgrade, and support primarily for the Chemical Information Systems at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. This is for the continuation of current on going research project. Competing this requirement and awarding to any other source would result in substantial delays and disruption of a project already in progress and would also increase the overall cost to the Government.  There is no solicitation number, for reference use PR Number W74MYF8344N189.  This procurement shall be under other than full and open competition procedures in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quote. Any response to this notice must be submitted in writing to the Government and show clear and convincing evidence that another source is capable of meeting the Governments requirements and that competition of the requirement would be advantageous to the Government.  If no written responses are received at least fifteen (15) days after the publication of this response, the purchase will be awarded without further notice.  The Point of Contact for this action is: Nicola.Ohaegbu@us.army.mil.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>VHA's Employee Education System desires to provide a series of resource materials using written, graphic, and video formats that serve as the operating system for "Innovative Multi Purpose Work Spaces (Learning Xchanges)" being constructed system wide.  These materials will allow the thoughtful integration of physical environments, innovative as well as creative learning and change processes, and technology that provides practical support for both. The central laboratory for the creation and testing of those concepts has been the Cleveland EERC Learning Xchange under the guidance of the EES Research Development and Dissemination of Innovations function.  The components of the operating system are now ready for sharing with other Innovative Multi Purpose Work Spaces which are emerging VHA wide.  But they need to be captured in written documents, graphic displays, and video segments.This work is a critical element in EES' Strategic Goal #5 which reinforces our effort to support VHA's Transformational Goal #4 - Creating a Learning Organization.  These goals stipulate how EES will assist designated learning officers to transform physical environments, learning and change interventions, and technology to create a comprehensive and integrated approach to how learning is aligned with the mission of VHA and its individual and collective facilities.  Further, these materials will support the development of certified learning/change professionals responsible for staffing these transformational organizations.  The manuals, playbooks, videos, etc. will all be designed to simplify the work of learning professionals and staff while simultaneously improving the outcome for learners.

In close collaboration with these program areas, as well as with MOH/NASCOP/GOK and other key USG stakeholders and partners, incumbent creates model projects piloting integration across program areas to promote the mainstreaming of prevention and to be used in developing standard operating procedures (SOPs) or toolkits for launching other similar initiatives.</p>

<p>Program Development and Oversight: 25%<br />Incumbent develops creative ways to integrate a prevention mindset across program areas by participating in the development and refinement of country program strategies, and by providing technical oversight and assistance on prevention activities. Incumbent provides technical consultation and assistance to the CDC Office, local host government, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) on how to integrate specific HIV/AIDS prevention programs and activities. Incumbent serves as the project officer for up to two of CDC-Kenya's large, umbrella, non-governmental cooperative agreements, currently receiving over $9M in CDC-awarded funds. As project officer, incumbent provides technical guidance to recipients on supporting sub-grantees' programs and activities; works with recipients' technical teams to develop innovative strategies to respond to the HIV epidemic in Kenya using an evidence-based approach; supports identification of new sub-partners to undertake such work; assures technical review and provides guidance on project proposals and requests for project funding; and, orchestrates unified coordination from the CDC-GAP technical team across the multiple program areas in which the umbrella project is funded.</p>
<p>Program Coordination: 20%<br />Serves as a member of the USG (PEPFAR) Interagency Technical Team for Prevention to establish, expand, define, and leverage available resources and strategic partnerships with GOK Ministries, collaborating organizations, and other appropriate partners to improve prevention and support services for families and people affected by HIV/AIDS. Incumbent establishes and builds collaboration and synergies among MOH and USG implementing partners and other agencies and organizations, and facilitates dialogue and mutual work relationships between implementing partners, local government entities, and other HIV/AIDS stakeholders.

<p>e. Clearances <br />(a) Medical</p>
<p>1) U.S. citizens: PSCs and their dependents are eligible for Health Unit services and medical evacuation coverage (Medevac) at Government expense if the following conditions are met:<br />-- The PSC must have a current Medical clearance or waiver.<br />-- The PSC must maintain health benefits coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service.<br />-- The PSC's contract stipulates that s/he is eligible for MED services and requires the individual to have health insurance coverage overseas.<br />-- The employing agency is paying for medical services under the International Cooperative Support Services (ICASS) and guarantees funding for the direct charge of local hospitalization and medical evacuation.</p>
<p>2) Non-U.S. citizens: PSCs and their dependents are ineligible for Health Unit services and medical evacuation coverage (Medevac) at Government expense. However, CDC policy mandates that the PSC must meet the following conditions:<br />-- The PSC must have a current Medical clearance or waiver.<br />-- The PSC must have and maintain health benefits coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service.<br />-- The PSC must have and maintain medical evacuation (medevac) coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service. The Government will reimburse the cost of medevac insurance premiums. See C.3.i. Insurance (3) Medevac Insurance (b).<br />3) For all assignments outside of the United States, the contractor and any authorized dependents shall be required to be examined by one or more licensed doctors of medicine acceptable to CDC, and the contractor shall forward a summary of the results of the medical exams as well as copies of the original tests and laboratory reviews to the CDC's Office of Health and Safety (OHS) for adjudication as to whether the requirements of the position and assignment are met. For non-U.S. citizen PSCs, OHS makes these determinations internally but for U.S. citizen PSCs, OHS passes their recommendations on to Department of State's Office of Medical Services (State/MED) for a final determination. The OHS or State/MED decision is furnished to the Contracting Officer prior to the official award of a contract. The Government shall reimburse the contractor for all costs associated with obtaining the aforementioned medical clearance examinations. Note: The official award of a contract is dependent upon the successful completion of the medical clearance. If the medical clearance is not granted and a waiver is not obtained, the contractor may be ineligible for award.</p>
<p>(b) Suitability Background Check<br />Based on the required Suitability Background Check, contractor shall have no access to classified or administratively controlled materials. However, failure to obtain the Suitability Background Check required for full performance of all duties described in the position description may deem the offeror ineligible for award or, if already awarded, constitute cause for contract termination.</p>
<p>(c) Applies to only U.S. citizens: Security clearance is not required at this time, however, should such clearance become required during the period of performance of the contract, contractor shall be required to obtain security clearance prior to having access to classified information.</p>
<p>f. Work Week and Compensation<br />The contractor's workweek shall not be less than 40 hours, unless otherwise provided in the Contract Schedule, and shall coincide with the workweek for those employed by the Mission or the host country agency most closely associated with the work of this contract. If the contract is for less than full time (40 hours weekly), the annual and sick leave earned shall be prorated (see the general provision of this contract entitled Leave and Holidays).<br />The contractor's compensation shall not be adjusted to reflect the pay comparability adjustments, which are granted from time to time to U.S. direct-hire employees by Executive Order for the statutory pay systems.</p>
<p>g. Leave and Holidays<br />1) Annual Leave:<br />(i) The rate of earned annual leave is determined on a case-by-case basis by the Coordinating Office for Global Health (COGH). In making this determination, COGH considers the individual's previous relevant service to the US Government through any of various employment, contractual, or grantee arrangements. However, no annual leave credit shall be earned if the tour of duty is less than 90 calendar days. Former Civil Service and CDC personal contractual service is creditable towards PSC service for annual leave accumulation purposes. Leave is earned at the following accumulation rates per pay period, based on relevant service credited by COGH:<br />0 to 3 years: 6 hrs.<br />Over 3 years: 8 hrs.<br />(These rates are based on a combination of annual leave and home leave granted to members of the Foreign Service.)<br />(ii) It is understood that annual leave is provided under this contract primarily for the purposes of affording necessary rest and recreation during the tour of duty in the host country and may be used only with the written approval of the CDC Field Supervisor or Contracting Officer. The Contractor in consultation with the CDC Field Supervisor shall develop a leave schedule early in his/her tour of duty taking into consideration project requirements, employee preference and other factors. Unused annual leave will be reimbursed at the end of the period of performance of the resultant contract provided such leave does not exceed the annual carryover limit, currently 360 hours, plus the number of hours earned and unused during the final pay year during performance under this contract.<br />(iii) With the approval of the CDC Field Supervisor, and if the circumstances warrant, a contractor may be authorized advance annual leave in excess of leave earned, but in no case shall a contractor be authorized advance annual leave in excess of that which he/she will earn over the life of the contract. The contractor agrees to reimburse CDC for leave used in excess of the amount earned during the contractor's assignment under the contract.<br />2) Sick Leave: Sick leave is earned at a rate not to exceed 13 workdays per annum or 4 hours every 2 weeks. Unused sick leave may be carried over under an extension of this contract, but the contractor will not be compensated for unused sick leave at the completion of this contract. Sick leave may be carried over from one post to another whether or not a break in service occurs.</p>
<p>3) Relief Travel<br />The contractor shall be entitled to the reimbursement of air travel to return to the city of recruitment or the last legal residence at the time of the contractor's original recruitment - to be determined by the Government at contract award. Relief travel refers to the reimbursement of air travel only and is earned for service outside the continental United States that allows the contractor to return to the city of last legal residence at the time of the contractor's recruitment, or to any other place the contractor chooses, but reimbursable only up to the cost of round-trip tickets for the contractor and legal dependents at post to the city of recruitment or the last legal residence at the time of the contractor's recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. If the contractor wants to go elsewhere, the costs reimbursed will be limited to those costs equal to the contractor's last residence at time of recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. The contractor shall be responsible for all additional costs above those costs that would be required for a return trip to the last legal residence at the time of recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. If the costs are less than those costs that would be required for a return trip to the last legal residence at the time of original recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award, then the reimbursable costs would be limited to the total cost of the trip. The contractor and dependents shall be eligible for relief travel when the following conditions are met:<br />i. The period of performance of awarded contract is for a minimum of 12 months. <br />ii. One relief travel reimbursement shall be granted per 12-month contract period served at place of performance as designated in the contract.<br />iii. Contractor must have served a minimum of 4 consecutive months at place of performance as designated in the contract at commencement of Relief Travel.<br />iv. Contractor must serve a minimum of 3 consecutive months at place of performance as designated in the contract upon return from Relief Travel, or the cost of the Relief Travel will be deducted from the contractor's final payment, and any costs not recovered by deduction will be reimburseable to the Government.<br />v. The contractor must be approved in advance in writing for use of sufficient annual leave, leave without pay, or a combination thereof, for Relief Travel.<br />Exceptions to the above conditions shall be coordinated with COGH. Exceptions shall be based on extenuating circumstances only. If the period of performance of resultant contract exceeds 12 months or an option is exercised, and the contractor qualifies for relief travel, each relief travel reimbursement shall be used a minimum of 6 months apart. The contractor shall be reimbursed for any cancellation cost that is incurred which is caused by the Government.</p>
<p>4) Emergency Travel<br />Emergency transportation costs will be reimbursed IAW paragraph 3 Relief Travel above. To be eligible for reimbursement of transportation costs under emergency conditions, one of the following circumstances must exist:<br />(i) Need for medical care beyond that available within the area to which the employee is assigned or serious effect on physical or mental health if residence is continued at assigned post of duty. CDC Field Supervisor or Government Procurement Contracting Officer (PCO) may authorize a medical attendant to accompany the employee at contractor expense if, based on medical opinion, such an attendant is necessary.<br />(ii) Death, or serious illness or injury of a member of the immediate family of the employee as determined by COGH or the immediate family of the employee's spouse.<br />When, for any reason, the CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO determines it is necessary to evacuate the contractor or contractor's dependents, the contractor will be reimbursed IAW paragraph 3 Relief Travel above. The return of such employees and dependents may also be authorized by the CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO when, in his/her discretion, he/she determines it is prudent to do so, and based on medical opinion, contractor is fit to return to duty.<br />.<br />The CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO may also authorize the reimbursement of emergency transportation in other situations, when in his/her opinion, the circumstances warrant such action. Such authorization shall include the kind of leave to be used and appropriate restrictions as to time away from post, transportation of personal and household effects, etc.</p>
<p>5) Holidays <br />The contractor, while serving abroad, shall be entitled to all USG holidays and may also be excused from duty on local holidays and other occasions when the U.S. embassy is closed. However, there will be no additional compensation should the PSC be required to work on a local holiday that is not also a U.S. holiday.</p>
<p>6) Leave Without Pay <br />Leave without pay may be granted only with the written approval of the CDC Field Supervisor or Contracting Officer.<br />7) Compensatory Time and Overtime<br />The accrual and use of Compensatory (Comp) Time may be approved in lieu of overtime pay for irregular or occasional overtime work. A PSC employee whose contract does not provide for overtime pay may be awarded Comp Time for overtime hours worked. One hour of Comp Time off is granted for each hour of overtime work. The accrual and use of Comp Time is subject to written supervisory approval, as with Annual Leave. All Comp Time hours must be recorded on the Time and Attendance Report as they are earned and used.<br />A PSC employee will lose entitlement to Comp Time earned if it is not used by the end of eight pay periods immediately after having been earned (16 weeks beginning the first pay period after the pay period in which the Comp Time was earned), unless the failure was due to an exigency of the service beyond the employee's control.<br />Overtime and Sunday Differential are not authorized under this contract. Should overtime be required during the performance of this contract, the Field Supervisor shall submit a request for contract modification.</p>
<p>8) Passport<br />All passports must be valid for the entire period of performance of the contract. In the event that a passport expires during the period of performance of resulting contract, a copy of the renewed passport shall be submitted to the PCO.</p>
<p>h. Social Security, Federal Income Tax and Foreign Earned Income - Applies to only U.S. Citizens and Permanent Resident Aliens of the U.S. subject to U.S. Federal Income and FICA laws.<br />1) As a Personal Service Contract employee, when applicable, F.I.C.A. contributions and U.S. Federal Income Tax withholding shall be deducted from salary payments in accordance with regulations and rulings of the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, respectively.<br />2) As a Personal Service Contract employee, the contractor is not eligible for the "foreign earned income" exclusion under the IRS Regulations (see 26 CFR 1.911-3(c)(3)).</p>
<p>i. Insurance<br />1) Worker's Compensation Benefits<br />The contractor shall be provided worker's compensation benefits in accordance with the Federal Employees' Compensation Act.</p>
<p>2) Health and Life Insurance.<br />a) The contractor shall be provided a maximum contribution of up to 75% against the actual costs of the contractor's annual health insurance costs, excluding costs for private medical evacuation (medevac) insurance, if any, provided that such costs may not exceed the maximum U.S. Government contribution for direct-hire personnel under the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program, as announced annually by the Office of Personnel Management.</p>
<p>b) The contractor shall be provided a maximum contribution of up to 33 1/3% against the actual costs of annual basic life insurance coverage on the same basis as the U.S. Government contribution for direct-hire personnel under the Federal Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) Program. Basic life insurance coverage is defined as coverage up to an amount equal to the contractor's annual basic salary rounded up to the next even $1,000 plus $2,000.</p>
<p>c) Retired U.S. Government employees shall not be paid additional contributions for health or life insurance under their contracts. The Government will normally have already paid its contribution for the retiree unless the employee can prove to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer that his/her health and life insurance does not provide coverage or specifically excludes coverage overseas. In such cases, the contractor could be eligible for contributions under paragraphs i.2(a) and/or (b) of this provision.</p>
<p>d) Proof of health and life insurance coverage shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer before any contribution is paid. On assignments of less than one year, costs for health and life insurance shall be prorated and paid accordingly.</p>
<p>e) A contractor who is a spouse of a current or retired Civil Service, Foreign Service, or Military Service member and who is covered by their spouse's Government health and/or life insurance policy is ineligible for the contribution under i. Insurance 1) and/or 2), respectively, of this provision.</p>
<p>3) Medevac Coverage<br />a) U.S. Citizens: U.S. citizens who meet the medical clearance requirements are furnished medical evacuation service at no cost.</p>
<p>b) Non U.S. citizens do not qualify for government furnished medical evacuation service at no cost and thus will be responsible for obtaining required medical evacuation (medevac) insurance. CDC shall reimburse 100% of the fair and reasonable cost of medevac insurance maintained by the contractor. CDC does not require that contractor obtain coverage from any one specific company. The contractor is responsible for and has the discretion to choose a provider. For information purposes only: The Department of State maintains a list of U.S. based providers on the following website: <br />http://travel.state.gov/travel/tips/brochures/brochures_1215.html</p>
<p>CDC provides no endorsement, expressly or implied, of any emergency medical service provider. Contractors have full discretion to consider providers not provided in this list, but are expected to verify that the coverage they do obtain will adequately cover an evacuation due to a medical situation that arises in the location of contract performance. CDC shall approve a fair and reasonable amount for obtaining the required coverage as a direct cost to the contract. After receipt of an offer letter, the contractor shall furnish evidence of obtaining medevac insurance and its cost, for the employee and all accompanying family members on U.S. Government travel orders, in order for CDC to reimburse the fair and reasonable cost of medevac insurance.</p>

A final evaluation will be performed at contract completion. The Performance Based Matrix included in this contract as Attachment 1 will serve as the basis for evaluation. A Personal Services Contractor Evaluation Form will be used and will be provided after contract award. Awarding of any contract extension shall be contingent upon receipt of an evaluation reflecting at least a satisfactory (acceptable, passing) level of performance under the contract during the previous 12 months of service. The reviews shall be scheduled and coordinated with the CDC Field Supervisor. The Field Supervisor shall provide the PSC employee with the appropriate performance standards for this position.</p>

<p>e. Clearances <br />(a) Medical</p>
<p>1) U.S. citizens: PSCs and their dependents are eligible for Health Unit services and medical evacuation coverage (Medevac) at Government expense if the following conditions are met:<br />-- The PSC must have a current Medical clearance or waiver.<br />-- The PSC must maintain health benefits coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service.<br />-- The PSC's contract stipulates that s/he is eligible for MED services and requires the individual to have health insurance coverage overseas.<br />-- The employing agency is paying for medical services under the International Cooperative Support Services (ICASS) and guarantees funding for the direct charge of local hospitalization and medical evacuation.</p>
<p>2) Non-U.S. citizens: PSCs and their dependents are ineligible for Health Unit services and medical evacuation coverage (Medevac) at Government expense. However, CDC policy mandates that the PSC must meet the following conditions:<br />-- The PSC must have a current Medical clearance or waiver.<br />-- The PSC must have and maintain health benefits coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service.<br />-- The PSC must have and maintain medical evacuation (medevac) coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service.

For non-U.S. citizen PSCs, OHS makes these determinations internally but for U.S. citizen PSCs, OHS passes their recommendations on to Department of State's Office of Medical Services (State/MED) for a final determination. The OHS or State/MED decision is furnished to the Contracting Officer prior to the official award of a contract. The Government shall reimburse the contractor for all costs associated with obtaining the aforementioned medical clearance examinations. Note: The official award of a contract is dependent upon the successful completion of the medical clearance. If the medical clearance is not granted and a waiver is not obtained, the contractor may be ineligible for award.</p>
<p>(b) Suitability Background Check<br />Based on the required Suitability Background Check, contractor shall have no access to classified or administratively controlled materials. However, failure to obtain the Suitability Background Check required for full performance of all duties described in the position description may deem the offeror ineligible for award or, if already awarded, constitute cause for contract termination.</p>
<p>(c) Applies to only U.S. citizens: Security clearance is not required at this time, however, should such clearance become required during the period of performance of the contract, contractor shall be required to obtain security clearance prior to having access to classified information.</p>
<p>f. Work Week and Compensation<br />The contractor's workweek shall not be less than 40 hours, unless otherwise provided in the Contract Schedule, and shall coincide with the workweek for those employed by the Mission or the host country agency most closely associated with the work of this contract. If the contract is for less than full time (40 hours weekly), the annual and sick leave earned shall be prorated (see the general provision of this contract entitled Leave and Holidays).<br />The contractor's compensation shall not be adjusted to reflect the pay comparability adjustments, which are granted from time to time to U.S. direct-hire employees by Executive Order for the statutory pay systems.</p>
<p>g. Leave and Holidays<br />1) Annual Leave:<br />(i) The rate of earned annual leave is determined on a case-by-case basis by the Coordinating Office for Global Health (COGH). In making this determination, COGH considers the individual's previous relevant service to the US Government through any of various employment, contractual, or grantee arrangements. However, no annual leave credit shall be earned if the tour of duty is less than 90 calendar days. Former Civil Service and CDC personal contractual service is creditable towards PSC service for annual leave accumulation purposes. Leave is earned at the following accumulation rates per pay period, based on relevant service credited by COGH:<br />0 to 3 years: 6 hrs.<br />Over 3 years: 8 hrs.<br />(These rates are based on a combination of annual leave and home leave granted to members of the Foreign Service.)<br />(ii) It is understood that annual leave is provided under this contract primarily for the purposes of affording necessary rest and recreation during the tour of duty in the host country and may be used only with the written approval of the CDC Field Supervisor or Contracting Officer. The Contractor in consultation with the CDC Field Supervisor shall develop a leave schedule early in his/her tour of duty taking into consideration project requirements, employee preference and other factors. Unused annual leave will be reimbursed at the end of the period of performance of the resultant contract provided such leave does not exceed the annual carryover limit, currently 360 hours, plus the number of hours earned and unused during the final pay year during performance under this contract.<br />(iii) With the approval of the CDC Field Supervisor, and if the circumstances warrant, a contractor may be authorized advance annual leave in excess of leave earned, but in no case shall a contractor be authorized advance annual leave in excess of that which he/she will earn over the life of the contract. The contractor agrees to reimburse CDC for leave used in excess of the amount earned during the contractor's assignment under the contract.</p>
<p><br />2) Sick Leave: Sick leave is earned at a rate not to exceed 13 workdays per annum or 4 hours every 2 weeks. Unused sick leave may be carried over under an extension of this contract, but the contractor will not be compensated for unused sick leave at the completion of this contract. Sick leave may be carried over from one post to another whether or not a break in service occurs.</p>
<p>3) Relief Travel<br />The contractor shall be entitled to the reimbursement of air travel to return to the city of recruitment or the last legal residence at the time of the contractor's original recruitment - to be determined by the Government at contract award. Relief travel refers to the reimbursement of air travel only and is earned for service outside the continental United States that allows the contractor to return to the city of last legal residence at the time of the contractor's recruitment, or to any other place the contractor chooses, but reimbursable only up to the cost of round-trip tickets for the contractor and legal dependents at post to the city of recruitment or the last legal residence at the time of the contractor's recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. If the contractor wants to go elsewhere, the costs reimbursed will be limited to those costs equal to the contractor's last residence at time of recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. The contractor shall be responsible for all additional costs above those costs that would be required for a return trip to the last legal residence at the time of recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. If the costs are less than those costs that would be required for a return trip to the last legal residence at the time of original recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award, then the reimbursable costs would be limited to the total cost of the trip. The contractor and dependents shall be eligible for relief travel when the following conditions are met:</p>
<p><br />i. The period of performance of awarded contract is for a minimum of 12 months. <br />ii. One relief travel reimbursement shall be granted per 12-month contract period served at place of performance as designated in the contract.<br />iii. Contractor must have served a minimum of 4 consecutive months at place of performance as designated in the contract at commencement of Relief Travel.<br />iv. Contractor must serve a minimum of 3 consecutive months at place of performance as designated in the contract upon return from Relief Travel, or the cost of the Relief Travel will be deducted from the contractor's final payment, and any costs not recovered by deduction will be reimburseable to the Government.<br />v. The contractor must be approved in advance in writing for use of sufficient annual leave, leave without pay, or a combination thereof, for Relief Travel.<br />Exceptions to the above conditions shall be coordinated with COGH. Exceptions shall be based on extenuating circumstances only. If the period of performance of resultant contract exceeds 12 months or an option is exercised, and the contractor qualifies for relief travel, each relief travel reimbursement shall be used a minimum of 6 months apart. The contractor shall be reimbursed for any cancellation cost that is incurred which is caused by the Government.</p>
<p>4) Emergency Travel<br />Emergency transportation costs will be reimbursed IAW paragraph 3 Relief Travel above. To be eligible for reimbursement of transportation costs under emergency conditions, one of the following circumstances must exist:<br />(i) Need for medical care beyond that available within the area to which the employee is assigned or serious effect on physical or mental health if residence is continued at assigned post of duty. CDC Field Supervisor or Government Procurement Contracting Officer (PCO) may authorize a medical attendant to accompany the employee at contractor expense if, based on medical opinion, such an attendant is necessary.<br />(ii) Death, or serious illness or injury of a member of the immediate family of the employee as determined by COGH or the immediate family of the employee's spouse.<br />When, for any reason, the CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO determines it is necessary to evacuate the contractor or contractor's dependents, the contractor will be reimbursed IAW paragraph 3 Relief Travel above. The return of such employees and dependents may also be authorized by the CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO when, in his/her discretion, he/she determines it is prudent to do so, and based on medical opinion, contractor is fit to return to duty.<br /><br />The CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO may also authorize the reimbursement of emergency transportation in other situations, when in his/her opinion, the circumstances warrant such action. Such authorization shall include the kind of leave to be used and appropriate restrictions as to time away from post, transportation of personal and household effects, etc.</p>
<p>5) Holidays <br />The contractor, while serving abroad, shall be entitled to all USG holidays and may also be excused from duty on local holidays and other occasions when the U.S. embassy is closed. However, there will be no additional compensation should the PSC be required to work on a local holiday that is not also a U.S. holiday.</p>
<p>6) Leave Without Pay <br />Leave without pay may be granted only with the written approval of the CDC Field Supervisor or Contracting Officer.<br />7) Compensatory Time and Overtime<br />The accrual and use of Compensatory (Comp) Time may be approved in lieu of overtime pay for irregular or occasional overtime work. A PSC employee whose contract does not provide for overtime pay may be awarded Comp Time for overtime hours worked. One hour of Comp Time off is granted for each hour of overtime work. The accrual and use of Comp Time is subject to written supervisory approval, as with Annual Leave. All Comp Time hours must be recorded on the Time and Attendance Report as they are earned and used.<br />A PSC employee will lose entitlement to Comp Time earned if it is not used by the end of eight pay periods immediately after having been earned (16 weeks beginning the first pay period after the pay period in which the Comp Time was earned), unless the failure was due to an exigency of the service beyond the employee's control.<br />Overtime and Sunday Differential are not authorized under this contract. Should overtime be required during the performance of this contract, the Field Supervisor shall submit a request for contract modification.</p>
<p>8) Passport<br />All passports must be valid for the entire period of performance of the contract. In the event that a passport expires during the period of performance of resulting contract, a copy of the renewed passport shall be submitted to the PCO.</p>
<p>h. Social Security, Federal Income Tax and Foreign Earned Income - Applies to only U.S. Citizens and Permanent Resident Aliens of the U.S. subject to U.S. Federal Income and FICA laws.<br />1) As a Personal Service Contract employee, when applicable, F.I.C.A. contributions and U.S. Federal Income Tax withholding shall be deducted from salary payments in accordance with regulations and rulings of the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, respectively.<br />2) As a Personal Service Contract employee, the contractor is not eligible for the "foreign earned income" exclusion under the IRS Regulations (see 26 CFR 1.911-3(c)(3)).</p>
<p>i. Insurance<br />1) Worker's Compensation Benefits<br />The contractor shall be provided worker's compensation benefits in accordance with the Federal Employees' Compensation Act.</p>
<p>2) Health and Life Insurance.<br />a) The contractor shall be provided a maximum contribution of up to 75% against the actual costs of the contractor's annual health insurance costs, excluding costs for private medical evacuation (medevac) insurance, if any, provided that such costs may not exceed the maximum U.S. Government contribution for direct-hire personnel under the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program, as announced annually by the Office of Personnel Management.</p>
<p>b) The contractor shall be provided a maximum contribution of up to 33 1/3% against the actual costs of annual basic life insurance coverage on the same basis as the U.S. Government contribution for direct-hire personnel under the Federal Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) Program. Basic life insurance coverage is defined as coverage up to an amount equal to the contractor's annual basic salary rounded up to the next even $1,000 plus $2,000.</p>
<p>c) Retired U.S. Government employees shall not be paid additional contributions for health or life insurance under their contracts. The Government will normally have already paid its contribution for the retiree unless the employee can prove to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer that his/her health and life insurance does not provide coverage or specifically excludes coverage overseas. In such cases, the contractor could be eligible for contributions under paragraphs i.2(a) and/or (b) of this provision.</p>
<p>d) Proof of health and life insurance coverage shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer before any contribution is paid. On assignments of less than one year, costs for health and life insurance shall be prorated and paid accordingly.</p>
<p>e) A contractor who is a spouse of a current or retired Civil Service, Foreign Service, or Military Service member and who is covered by their spouse's Government health and/or life insurance policy is ineligible for the contribution under i. Insurance 1) and/or 2), respectively, of this provision.</p>
<p>3) Medevac Coverage<br />a) U.S. Citizens: U.S. citizens who meet the medical clearance requirements are furnished medical evacuation service at no cost.</p>
<p>b) Non U.S. citizens do not qualify for government furnished medical evacuation service at no cost and thus will be responsible for obtaining required medical evacuation (medevac) insurance. CDC shall reimburse 100% of the fair and reasonable cost of medevac insurance maintained by the contractor. CDC does not require that contractor obtain coverage from any one specific company. The contractor is responsible for and has the discretion to choose a provider. For information purposes only: The Department of State maintains a list of U.S. based providers on the following website: <br />http://travel.state.gov/travel/tips/brochures/brochures_1215.html</p>
<p>CDC provides no endorsement, expressly or implied, of any emergency medical service provider. Contractors have full discretion to consider providers not provided in this list, but are expected to verify that the coverage they do obtain will adequately cover an evacuation due to a medical situation that arises in the location of contract performance. CDC shall approve a fair and reasonable amount for obtaining the required coverage as a direct cost to the contract. After receipt of an offer letter, the contractor shall furnish evidence of obtaining medevac insurance and its cost, for the employee and all accompanying family members on U.S. Government travel orders, in order for CDC to reimburse the fair and reasonable cost of medevac insurance.</p>
<p>j. Performance Review<br />This is a Performance Based Contract with a requirement for an evaluation of contractor performance to be conducted at least once every 12 months. The initial evaluation will take place 6 months after contract award and each subsequent evaluation will be performed annually 12 months from the date of the initial evaluation, and each year thereafter on a recurring 12 month schedule. A final evaluation will be performed at contract completion. The Performance Based Matrix included in this contract as Attachment 1 will serve as the basis for evaluation. A Personal Services Contractor Evaluation Form will be used and will be provided after contract award. Awarding of any contract extension shall be contingent upon receipt of an evaluation reflecting at least a satisfactory (acceptable, passing) level of performance under the contract during the previous 12 months of service. The reviews shall be scheduled and coordinated with the CDC Field Supervisor. The Field Supervisor shall provide the PSC employee with the appropriate performance standards for this position.</p>

<DESC><p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Acquisition and Grants Office, Mountain Region Acquisition Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, with the University of Bristol located at Cantocks Close, Bristol BS8 1TS for Trace Gas Measurements in Barbados.
<p>The sole source determination is based on the University of Bristols' access to the specific specialized measuring instrumentation required under this contract, the technical expertise to continue the data linkage requirement and that no other contractor has indicated an interest in providing this service.</p>
<p>The anticipated contract will be for a period of 60 months which includes a base year, and four (4) one-year option periods. Anticipated award date is no later than March 22, 2009. The anticipated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 541990 and the small business size standard is $7.0 million dollars.</p>
<p>This requirement is a follow-on contract to RA133003CN3025 with International Science Consultants. NOAA publicized this requirement on May 29, 2008 to determine if there were any other sources capable of providing highly accurate measurements. The University of Bristol located at Cantocks Close, Bristol BS8 1TS, is the only known qualified and responsible source.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Barbados site is one of four stations comprising the current Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) network beginning in the time frame of 1993-1996. This network originated from the Atmospheric Lifetime Experiment (ALE) in 1978 and transformed to Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (GAGE) with the addition of new instruments during the 1981-1985 time frame. These networks were established to monitor the long-term trends of several trace gas species that cause stratospheric ozone destruction. Aside from NOAA's Global Monitoring Division (GMD) program, there are no other such national organized networks; only one or two other sites operated by foreign governments. Data from the network are analyzed for long-term trends, changes in sources, and global budgets and published jointly by the AGAGE research team. The species are key compounds in the issues of stratospheric ozone depletion and "greenhouse" climate warming. Thus, there is a fundamental scientific need to monitor the atmospheric concentrations of these species, and document their long-term increase. To establish the long-term change with high precision, the measurements must be made with a frequency of at least several observations per day. There is a critical scientific requirement that the future measurements are directly linked to those of the past and to the other sites of the GAGE network. This requirement is completely inflexible and, without this link to the past, the future measurements would have minimal value.</p>
<p>The following measurements have been made at East Point, Barbados by contractors, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and NOAA: beginning in 1978, measurements of the trace gas species CFC-11 (CCl3F), CFC-12 (CCl2F2), carbon tetrachloride (CC14,) methyl chloroform (CH3CC13), and nitrous oxide N2O. In 1985, methane (CH4) and CFC-113 (CClF2-CCl2F) were added. Chloroform (CHC13) was added in 1995.</p>
<p>GMD makes similar measurements at five additional sites and is, therefore, keenly interested in obtaining comparable data from Barbados. GMD has partially supported the Barbados measurements since 1984. The project will likely continue another 20 years or so, or as long as there is a threat of depletion of stratospheric ozone from the species being monitored.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>The NOAA/GMD has a continuing need for a Contractor capable of furnishing the necessary personnel, facilities, equipment, materials, supplies and services (except as otherwise specified) to perform the following functions:</p>
<p>a. Make measurements of the concentrations in ambient air of the species listed in Table 1 below.</p>
<p>b. Make these measurements of each species with the frequency of at least once every 40 minutes.</p>
<p>c. Make these measurements within 100 meters from the seacoast at East Point (also known as Ragged Point), Barbados (approx 130 10'N. lat., 590 25' W. long).</p>
<p>d. Make these measurements with an absolute accuracy (relative to past AGAGE measurements) of 0.5% for CH4 and 1% for all other species. Typical Northern Hemisphere (NH) concentrations and relative precisions are reported in Table 1. Researchers there should measure each individual type of trace gases listed at atmospheric levels near its concentration in the NH, and with the precisions listed in Table 1.</p>
<p>e. Make these measurements by gas chromatography technology using Contractor furnished Hewlett-Packard Model 6890 ECD gas chromatograph, or equivalent.</p>
<p>f. The Contactor shall house the instrument in a Contractor furnished air-controlled Windowless shelter.</p>
<p>g. The Contractor shall make these measurements to be directly comparable and linked to similar measurements made at the Barbados location since 1978 by the American Lifetime Experiment (ALE) and its successor, the Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (GAGE). The ALK and GAGE programs are described in the Journal of Geophysical Research, Vol. 238, pp. 945-950, 1987.</p>
<p>h. The Contractor shall provide calibration standards interlinked with similar past measurements from ALE and similar contract-period measurements being made at other locations by the NASA-sponsored GAGE. Current GAGE standards are provided by Scripps Institution of Oceanography.</p>
<p>i. The Contractor shall provide personnel to visit the shelter at least once per day, every day of the year, to confirm instrument operational status and note and record weather conditions.</p>
<p>j. The Contractor shall attend meetings of the GAGE project team (held every 6 months) to discuss linkage of Barbados and other GAGE measurements.</p>
<p>k. The Contractor shall provide technical personnel to visit the site at least once every 4 months to service and repair equipment and replace expendable parts.</p>
<p>See attached Table 1.<br /><br />Requirements:Measurement Location and Infrastructure: The measurement location must be in a clean air sector and free from any local pollutants or contaminants.</p>
<p>Instrumentation must be reliable and have documented calibration and maintenance plan.</p>
<p>Every six months, a new time period of measured gas concentration data from the Barbarous site should be uploaded on the web for NOAA and other scientists to compare their measurements to the AGAGE data set. The timing should be right before the biannual AGAGE/NOAA meeting.</p>
<p>Data Reporting: A monthly report of gases measured must be submitted to:</p>
<p>NOAA / Global Monitoring Division<br />Attn: Observatory Operations<br />ESRL / GMD1<br />325 Broadway<br />Boulder, CO 80305</p>
<p>Data Linkage: The Barbados data must be directly comparable to the past historical record of measurements of these chemical species at that site and to the similar measurements at the four other AGAGE sites. The AGAGE team has achieved scientific acceptance and credibility for their data from many years of hard work with results and data freely available to the scientific community at large.</p>
<p>Measurements during the upcoming years must be directly comparable to those obtained since AGAGE began (partially supported by NOAA over the past fourteen years). This fundamental aspect of the project cannot be compromised. NOAA must be absolutely certain that detected atmospheric changes are real and not artifacts of instrumental or methodology changes.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe that they can provide services that fully meet the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation within 15 days after publication of this synopsis by emailing their capability statement to Contract Specialist Susan Labovitz at Susan.Labovitz@noaa.gov. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
