<CONTACT>Bonnie Oshiro, CONTRACTING OFFICER, Phone 8089835356, Fax 8089832900, Email bonnie.oshiro@noaa.gov
<DESC>The NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center is in need of an ultra-short baseline (USBL) acoustic tracking and communications unit for use with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV).  The AUV is a bottom-tracking vehicle that will be used primarily for obtaining high resolution benthic imagery.  

The USBL must be a completely independent system that will act as both a tracking device and redundant underwater communications system for the AUV.  The USBL system must be capable of integrating with a variety of topside navigation systems including GPS and pitch/roll/yaw sensor systems in order to log transponder locations relative to a topside platform. Further, the USBL system must be able to operate around research vessels where multipath acoustic signals are often problematic.  A complete USBL system is to be delivered including a transponder to be mounted on the AUV, a transceiver to be mounted on the topside platform, as well as any required cables and software.  Topside power supplies and computer systems do not need to be provided by the vendor, however, requirements for these systems should be provided.   

Required Features and Minimum Specifications:
•	Total system, including transceiver, transducer and navigation software which uses ship’s position and heading to develop underwater vehicle positions.  
•	Roll/Pitch/Heading accuracy 0.1/0.1/0.1 degrees
•	Strong rejection to acoustic multipath interference and ship-based self-noise through use of spread-spectrum acoustic techniques.
•	Extensive use of modern digital signal processing techniques and state-of-the art DSP processors sharply reduced cost for end users.
•	Compact design which eliminates a ship-based deck unit. 
•	Maximum Operational Depth: 1000m
•	Working Range:  1000m
•	Positioning Accuracy: 1 degree (slant angle from vessel)
•	Slant Range Accuracy: 0.25m
•	Transponder Maximum Dimension: 45cm x 13cm diameter
•	Transponder Maximum Weight in Water:  2.5 kg   
•	Transponder Minimum Battery Operation Time:  9 months


THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION IS ATTACHED.  NO FURTHER SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS WILL BE ISSUED. THIS IS A SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION WITH AN ESTIMATED VALUE OF LESS THAN $100,000.  THE WESTERN REGIONAL ACQUISITION DIVISION REQUIRES THAT ALL CONTRACTORS DOING BUSINESS WITH THIS ACQUISITION OFFICE BE REGISTERED WITH THE CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (CCR) AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2003.  AFTER THIS DATE, NO AWARD CAN BE MADE UNLESS THE VENDER IS REGISTERED IN CCR.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND TO REGISTER IN CCR PLEASE ACCESS THE FOLLOWING WEB SITE: HTTP://WWW.CCR.GOV.  IN ORDER TO REGISTER WITH THE CCR AND TO BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE AN AWARD FROM THIS ACQUISITION OFFICE, ALL OFFERORS MUST HAVE A DUN & BRADSTREET NUMBER.
