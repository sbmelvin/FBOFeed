<DESC>The Office on Disability, through the Division of Acquisition Management(DAM), Program Support Center (PSC), intends to award a 12 month sole source contract using simplified acquisition procedures to the American Association on Health and Disability,
110 N. Washington Street, Suite 328-B, Rockville, MD 20852.   The anticipated date of award is August 17, 2006.

The contractor shall conduct a study that compares the outcomes of children with disabilities (n = 100) in the treatment group  - mentor/mentee pairs participating in the National Initiative-- with children with disabilities (n = 100) in a control group—children who are not receiving any treatment.  Adding a control group will enhance the development and implementation of the National Initiative Evaluation System.

Introducing a control group would allow OD to increase considerably the rigor of the implementation study, and thus be able to more confidently support the claim that the program
is indeed an effective health promotion intervention. This information, including a statistically rigorous analysis of data, will be of value to many researchers as well as potential organizational sponsors.

The following tasks will be added to the implementation study:

Task 1 -
Participating organizations dedicated to physical fitness for children with disabilities will be recruited to participate in the study to attain a total of at least an N of 200 children with disabilities, 100 who will complete the mentor/mentee program for physical fitness (treatment group) and 100 who will not receive the treatment (control group).

Potential mentees will receive a data collection form that contains questions about key characteristics that might also have an impact on their success in and after the program, including such things as age, gender, type of disability, ethnicity, family socio-economic status, self-reported level of psycho-social support from family and community; community involvement and similar variables.

On the basis of the results of the data, potential recruits will be assigned to either the treatment group (participates in the mentor/mentee program for physical fitness) or the control group (does not participate in the mentor/mentee program for physical fitness). Assignment will be made across all agencies, taking into account the characteristics of all of the potential mentees
across all agencies, not within any one agency. 

Administration of the pre and post-tests would be accomplished using the current system of on-line surveys through the existing web site.

Provide monthly reports of the findings, comparing the outcomes of the treatment group with the control group, to answer the following specific questions:

1.  The degree of physical fitness realized by the treatment group compared with the control group during the period of the study?
2.  What are the descriptors (grouped data,  non-confidential) of the treatment and the control group participants, including average age, gender, and type of disability?
3.  What information about the physical activity and nutritional practice was given and how was it presented?
4.  Descriptors (grouped data, non-confidential)  of the organizations that sponsor the program?
5.  Outcomes of the physical fitness program as evaluated by the mentor, the mentee and the organization (grouped data and non-confidential)?
6.  Number of mentees that decide to move to the  next step in the physical fitness program beyond the initial award?

(a)  Develop and submit a report of the findings of the first post test of the Evaluation Study, comparing the outcomes of the children in the treatment group and the control group. The analyses must address the six questions listed above.
(b)  Develop and submit a report of the findings of the second post test of the Evaluation Study, comparing the outcomes of the children in the treatment group and the control group. The
analyses must address the six questions listed above.

Deliver final report summarizing the results of all phases of the study.

Deliverables for Task 1:
a.  Obtain written commitments from participating organizations that they will recruit at least 200 children with disabilities for the field study.  Send the Project Officer written notification that these commitments are on file and provide the Project Officer with a list of organizations providing the written commitments.
b.  Recruit from participating organizations a number sufficient to insure that at least 200 children will complete the study (100 who will participate in the mentor/mentee program
for physical fitness (treatment group) and 100 who will not receive the treatment (control group).
c.  Administer data collection instruments so that each participant provides the same information so that the distribution into the treatment and control groups is accomplished as objectively as possible.  After data collection and analysis, contractor will assign the participants into the treatment or control groups.

Deliverables for Task 2:
Provide monthly summary reports (January and February, 2007) about the progress of the implementation of the National Initiative for each of the children in the experimental and
control groups.  Provide evaluation data obtained from the participating disability-based organizations, including demographic information about the mentors and mentees,
types of programs of physical activity, types of nutritional information given, and assessments about the program by the mentors and mentees and pertinent information about the participants in the control group.

Deliverables for Task 3:

(a)  Develop and submit a report of the findings of the first post-test of the Evaluation Study, comparing the outcomes of the children in the treatment group and the control group.
The analyses must address the six questions listed above.
(b)  Develop and submit a report of the findings of the second post test of the Evaluation Study, comparing the outcomes of the children in the treatment group and the control group. The
analyses must address the six questions listed above.

Deliverable for Task 4:  
Deliver final report summarizing the results of all phases of the study.

<DESC>At the Industry Day for ATCOTS held in Oklahoma City on July 18, 2006, the FAA noted that there were several "themes" in some of questions being asked regarding the Problem Statement issued on June 16, 2006.  Three of those questions and their answers are in Attachment 1. In addition, the FAA noted that there were many questions that began with the phrase "would you consider" before stating some innovative idea.  The FAA's response to all such questions is that unless the vendor is considering altering one of the two constraints identified in the Problem Statement, any reasonable idea will be considered with its analysis/business case.  Finally, many of the questions referred to the White Paper as a "proposal" or "bid."  Please remember that these White Papers are not proposals.  The White Papers will help the FAA refine the acquisition.

The NQF is a voluntary consensus standards-setting organization as defined by the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-119 and is the only such organization at this time that is nationally accepted as a consensus standards setting organization.  CMS has entered into an alliance with the hospital community and has agreed that all measures that are publicly reported will be endorsed by the NQF.  CMS is planning to publicly report these mortality measures and thus needs to obtain NQF endorsement of the pneumonia mortality measure to fulfill its alliance responsibilities with the hospital community.  The NQF process has been identified as the only recognized source that engages a comprehensive call for measures, review of scientific and statistical evidence, and a forum for in-depth study of existing tools for comparing the performance of health care providers in various settings and has been the only organization that CMS uses to obtain consensus on the quality measures that it publicly reports.  The NQF is the only recognized voluntary consensus standards for health care quality measures organization as defined by the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (NTTAA) Public Law 104-113 and the Office of Management and Budget (circular A-119).  As defined in the NTTAA all NQF endorsement products address a consensus driven process to include, due process, openness and balance of broad based input.  The NQF is the primary entity to promulgate a comprehensive measurement framework and to endorse specific measures and measure sets that could be used to gauge healthcare and performance.  These five principal steps are: Consensus Standards Development, Review, Member Council Approval, Board of Director Endorsement and Evaluation.  Established as a public-private partnership, the NQF has broad participation from all parts of the health care system including: national, state, regional, and local groups.  Representing consumers, public and private purchasers, employers, health care professionals, provider organizations, health plans, accrediting bodies, labor unions, supporting industries and organizations involved in health care research or quality improvement.  The NQF has also convened a standing panel of leading experts in quality improvement and measurement to identify the principles and priorities that will guide a national measurement and reporting strategy.  The Forum will endorse quality measures for national use.  The Forum will also promote the use of quality information  and develop a research agenda to advance quality improvement.

<DESC>The United States Department of Transportation, Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA), Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), intends to solicit on a non-competitive basis, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302 under the statutory authority of 41 U.S.C.253 (c)(1) ? Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, with the Department of Mechanical and Nuclear Engineering at Kansas State University to procure consulting support for the Volpe Center on behalf of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration?s (NASA) Wake Vortex Program.  In 2003, a large phased microphone array test was conducted by the Volpe Center on behalf of NASA at the Denver International Airport (DEN) in order to study the various fundamental aspects of the wake acoustics phenomena.  The microphone array data collected from the 2003 DEN test contain environmental noises and hardware features that potentially could bias the interpretation of wake acoustic characteristics. Thus, an independent assessment is needed for the wake contorted behavior during the later stage of the decay process to understand how this final decay could reduce the hazard of wake encounters.  The objective of this purchase order is to apply a high fidelity computational aero-acoustic simulation to better understand acoustic phenomena, which would address the consistency of wake sound generation to guide future designs of sensors and microphone array distributions for specific wake avoidance needs.  The Contractor shall develop an unsteady three-dimensional simulation model of the wake vortex flow process which will incorporate the effects of wind and atmospheric turbulence, to emulate the contorted wake vortices at later wake age and their associated hazard level during wake encounters; and validate the simulation model developed above with government provided field acoustic data collected during the DEN 2003 exercise to demonstrate the effectiveness of the simulation model.  A complete statement of work will be set forth in the Request for Quotation (RFQ).  RFQ issuance will be on or about August 9, 2006.  The applicable North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541330 and the small business size standard is $4.0M.  This procurement will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.   THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Interested firms must submit a written capability statement to the above named point of contact providing clear and convincing evidence of the firm?s capability to provide the required services.

<DESC>NOTICE:  INTENT TO AWARD 
RE:  FDA1019535
SUBJECT:   Training for using Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicare, Medicaid, State Children's Health Insurance Programs (SCHIP), and Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) data for research.

Description:
The  Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), intends to negotiate a sole-source award with The University of Minnesota Research Data Assistance Center (ResDAC).  ResDAC is located at :

University of Minnesota/ResDAC
420 Delaware Street
D355 Mayo Memorial Bldg
Minneapolis, MN 55455

FDA anticipates issuing a firm-fixed price contract.  The contract period will be for as period of one year and will commence from date of award. 

Background:

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) offers researchers and other health care professionals a broad range of quantitative information gathered from its claims data by special request.  These include Identifiable Data Files that contain actual beneficiary-specific and physician-specific information.  CMS is also responsible for administering the Medicare, Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Programs (SCHIP), as well as a number of health oversight programs and also provides researchers access to special survey data, and limited datasets by special arrangements.  These data are made available to the public, subject to privacy release approvals and the availability of computing resources.
In addition, Section 1013 of Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003 authorizes research, demonstrations, and evaluations to improve the quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of the Federally administered Medicare program and of the two programs for which funding and administration is shared with the States: Medicaid and SCHIP.
The research and other activities undertaken and authorized by Section 1013 may address:
1)	The outcomes, comparative clinical effectiveness, and appropriateness of health care items and services (including prescription drugs); and
2)	Strategies for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP programs, including the ways in which health care items and services are organized, managed, and delivered under such programs.
Congress is encouraging FDA and CMS to find ways to utilize existing and soon-to-be-collected Part “D” Medicare data to foster drug safety, and to make the most economic use of pharmaceuticals covered by federal health programs.  As a result, the FDA has ongoing discussions with its sister agency, CMS, concerning prospects for gaining access to its giant Medicare claims databases through the establishment of an inter-agency (IAG) collaboration.  FDA has begun a “pilot” program to investigate the value to researchers of Medicare Part “B” outpatient data and FDA is expecting to gain access to the Part “D” (prescription drug benefit) claims database when it becomes available for Drug Surveillance and Research.
Separate from establishing an IAG, FDA is interested in procuring training on CMS data from organizations that have established agreements with CMS to provide instruction in using Medicare and/or Medicaid data for research and CMS data privacy requirements.  CMS data are complex and are created for claims reimbursements and not research specifically, and therefore FDA requires offerors to have documented experience in the use of the data, to have direct access to the data, and to have de-identified the data.
The statutory provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as amended by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA, Section 406), Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 310.305, and Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 314.80 require FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of regulated marketed products. The funding of "Training for using Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicare, Medicaid, State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), and Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) data for research" would serve as a mechanism for FDA staff to obtain comprehensive training on the use of CMS data files and their complexities with the goal of performing drug surveillance and epidemiology studies needed to address drug safety concerns of public health or regulatory importance.

Objectives:

•	FDA staff comprehensive training on CMS Medicare and Medicaid programs, the various administrative and research files and codes that can be used for research studies.
•	Hands-on training in the use of Medicare and Medicaid data files.
•	Information on how billing data are generated, the codes used, significant changes over time, and any restrictions on reimbursement that could affect research conclusions.
Work to include training covering the specific topics:
1)	An understanding of the basic structure and content of CMS Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP programs and changes over time;
2)	An overview of the various CMS data files available for research including extract and data retrieval capabilities of CMS Data Warehouse;
3)	Details on how the billing data are generated, the codes used in each database to capture demographic and medical events, and any restrictions on reimbursement that may affect how and when claims are processed;
4)	Hands-on, direct access to data with interactive sessions using PC-based tutorial of CMS Medicare and Medicaid program data information;



Other Requirements

•	Software Knowledge
FDA staff currently has various levels of familiarity with SAS and, for some, with STATA.  If other software is used, there may be a need for a brief training session required on the software to be used.
•	The Offeror shall provide information and documentation in support of the following:
1)	Experience with training or a combination of experience using CMS data and evidence of demonstrated ability of instructors to train staff using CMS data.  Offerors shall identify key personnel who will provide the training and submit their current curriculum vita.
2)	Technical, analytical, statistical, epidemiological and clinical capability to support training FDA staff.  Offerors shall also possess the ability to train FDA personnel in the use of the data as well as in technical issues relating to the use of the data.
3)	Structure and format of training, and training agenda;
4)	Training manuals, data dictionaries, and user guides;
5)	Training for a minimum of 20 FDA staff members and a maximum of 30 for the hands-on training;
6)	Hands-on, direct access to data with interactive sessions using PC-based tutorial:
a.	Documentation that data used for the hands-on training are not restricted and that practice files can be shared with a third party such as FDA;
b.	Documentation that data are HIPAA compliant.  No patient, provider, or health plan-specific identifiers will be required by FDA.  It shall be solely the Offeror’s responsibility to de-identify the data for FDA use.
c.	Capability of providing practice data to the FDA staff during the training session.  If possible, post-training data made available for practice would be desirable.
7)	A schedule of available dates for the training;
8)	A training plan to include facility, software (SAS or STATA); and computer equipment requirements.  Facility access must be within 25 Mile radius of the FDA White Oak campus located at 10903 New Hampshire Ave, Silver Spring, MD 20993-0002.
 



Sole Source Rationale

The University of Minnesota’s ResDAC Program  is uniquely qualified to conduct the project described in this requirement.   Their mission is to educate the research community and Federal agencies about how to obtain and how to use Medicare and Medicaid data.  As part of their CMS contract, ResDAC maintains a help desk and extensive internet site dedicated to explaining CMS data distribution policies and procedures. In addition, ResDAC is required to conduct workshops and training programs in order for researchers to receive hands on experience in using CMS data.
While many contractors have access to CMS data, the ResDAC project is the only contract that CMS supports to assist the research and Federal community in understanding and obtaining Medicare and Medicaid data..
Evaluation Criteria was based on the qualifications and requirements as stated above.
The Government could not achieve the specific objectives of this contract through any other means or with any other resources. 


THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND              
NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 15.203 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 10 DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.     A DETERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.     INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>The U. S. Coast Guard Maintenance and Logistics Command Atlantic (MLCLANT) is procuring services under Solicitation HSCG84-06-Q-AA8179 which will be available on or about August 4, 2006 via FedBizOps:  In an event of the possibility of a Category 2 to 5 hurricane during the hurricane season, U. S. Coast Guard Port Arthur Incident Command Post (ICP); which is a 24 hour 7 day a week operational command center; will need to be stood up in to a safe location that is away from current hurricane and potential future hurricane hazards and dangers.  The US Coast Guard requires a contracting vehicle to be in place that will allow us to have the “first right” to use the facility as an ICP in an event of a Category 2 or more hurricane to hit the Gulf shore resulting in evacuation of Port Arthur, Texas or Lake Charles, LA.  At least 96 hours prior to landfall of anything equal or greater than a category 2 hurricane, an advance team will be deployed to this location to set up for eventual ICP stand up.  At 48 hours prior to landfall, a decision will be made to expand the operation and more personnel will be arriving.  If a similar storm to Hurricanes Katrina/Rita hit, this will require that USCG Port Arthur stay for an undetermined period of time, due to the inability to return to normal operations in the Port Arthur, Texas or Lake Charles, LA areas.  Port Arthur will be forced to reconstitute full operations from this satellite location.  The requirements for the facility are as follows:  The ICP location needs to be within at least 200 miles and up to 250 miles North of MSU Port Arthur, Texas located at 2901 Turtle Creek Drive, Port Arthur, Texas.  Hospitals must be near by in addition to other basic amenities (commercial airport, availability of food).  Office space/conference rooms - four office/conference rooms to house a day/night, 24-hour watch.  One of the rooms must be able to accommodate approximately 4,800 square feet and the other three rooms must be no smaller than 120 square feet.  The 4,800 square feet office space/conference room must be able to accommodate or have the potential to accommodate 30 phone/fax lines and 20 internet connections spread out in the room. The three smaller conference rooms (no smaller than 120 square feet) must be able to accommodate or have the potential to accommodate 5 phone lines and 5 computer lines.  The Coast Guard must have the flexibility to increase the amount of lines needed as the operation grows.  The facility shall provide tables and chairs for at least 100 people.  The 4,800 square feet conference room must be able to accommodate or have the potential to have 20 electric outlets distributed throughout the room.  The other three smaller conference rooms must be able to accommodate or have the potential to accommodate 5 electric outlets distributed throughout each room.  Up to 150 hotel rooms may also be needed, therefore the operational facility must be within walking distance (1/2 mile) from hotels that could accommodate this number of rooms.  Parking will be needed for up to 200 vehicles.  The office/conference facility should be near locations or have the capability to serve full nutritious meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner and midnight rations (finger food) service.  The NAICS code is 721110. The Small Business Size Standard is $6.5 million.  The period of performance is anticipated for five-one year ordering periods commencing August 2006.  All vendors will be responsible for obtaining the solicitation and any subsequent amendments from the above site.  Any and all questions regarding the solicitation should be submitted, in writing, to Mrs. Roberta Smith at Roberta.H.Smith@uscg.mil.  This requirement will be issued using Full and Open Competition procedures.  Interested parties must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) as prescribed in FAR Clause 52.232.33.

<DESC>The Government intends to issue a sole source, firm fixed price contract to Synergy Construction, Inc., Woodinville, WA for the repair of water damaged interior and exterior walls, windows, flooring, and other incidental related work in Building 50.  Building 50 has been approved for transfer to the City of Bremerton as part of a real property transfer authorized by separate, special legislation, with the City of Bremerton providing appropriate, already determined consideration.  Synergy Construction, Inc., under a City of Bremerton competitively awarded contract, is currently renovating and making other improvements to the building.  Award of a Government construction contract to a contractor other than Synergy Construction, Inc., will result in significant physical crowding and a substantial duplication of costs.  The anticipated contract term is 60 days.  
The acquisition will be processed in accordance with FAR Part 15.  
The Government believes only one responsible source can satisfy the agency requirement.  The sole source justification authority is FAR 6.302-1.
This notice is not a Request for Proposal for competitive proposals.
Interested firms may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 2:00 p.m. local time on August 9, 2006.  
Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement using full and open competitive procedures.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. 
A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
Solicitation N44255-06-R-8004 will be issued to Synergy Construction, Inc. on August 10, 2006 with a response due no later than September 11, 2006.

<DESC>The National Park Service plans to solicit proposals to rehabilitate the Ellis Island Historic Seawall at Statue of Liberty National Monument and Ellis Island. Ellis Island is located in both the State of New Jersey and the State of New York; however, all of the work will be performed in the State of New Jersey. Work will include performing masonry repairs and structural repairs to various portions of the seawall. Masonry repairs include cleaning and re-pointing of granite face stones, resetting of granite face stones, and repairing and replacing granite face stones with replacement in-kind material. Structural repairs include placement of concrete fill in cavities beneath seawall, placement of filter zone behind seawall, placement of geotextile fabric in all exposed seawall joints during excavation for filter placement, installation of steel sheet piles with concrete backfill, wall underpinning with micro-piles, anchor replacement, placement of concrete beam along top of wall and battered micro-piles, placement of new concrete wall along back face of existing wall, and repair of broken and cracked concrete. The electronic Request for Proposals will be issued approximately August 9, 2006. The solicitation package will be available on the Department of Interior (DOI), National Business Center (NBC) website at http://ideasec.nbc.gov.  No paper copies of this solicitation will be available. No phone requests will be accepted. Prospective offerors must register on the NBC website to obtain a copy of this solicitation and to receive an electronic notification of any amendments. This service is provided for convenience only and does not serve as a guarantee of notification. Offerors are responsible for visiting this website periodically. No other notifications will be issued. The solicitation package will contain the price schedule, specifications, drawings, evaluation criteria for the selection of a contractor and notification of the pre-proposal site visit. Proposal documents will be available in Microsoft Word, HTML and Adobe PDF. The specifications and drawings will be available in Adobe PDF format. A negotiated firm-fixed-price contract will be awarded requiring submission of a technical proposal and a price proposal. Proposals submitted must demonstrate the following as part of the technical capability: 1. experience in reconstruction and treatment of historic bulkheads; 2. familiarity with submerged construction and performing dry repairs using cofferdams; 3. knowledge of masonry block repair on historic structures; 4. understanding of and experience with a complex assortment of historic structural foundation systems; 5. prior experience in managing operational constraints such as adverse daily and seasonal weather conditions, deep water, effects of tides, currents and waves, and working afloat. The available funding for this project is $6,772,000. Time for completion is 365 calendar days. It is anticipated that the notice to proceed will be issued in October 2006. A contract for this work will not be awarded unless all of the necessary permits have been obtained by the Government.  Outstanding permits include a federal consistency determination from the State of New Jersey, and permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) which includes two nationwide permits and a Section 10 permit. It is anticipated that all of the necessary permits will be obtained sometime in September 2006. The intent is to award this project at a single lump-sum price. Award determination will be based on the lowest price technically acceptable selection method. This project is being solicited using full-and-open competition and is open to both large business concerns and small business concerns.

The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms. Information shall be provided on either 1) all such contracts within the past three years, or 2) the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer, and shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the product was supplied and services were performed and the number (phone, fax or Internet) of a contact for each contract listed. The quoter should not describe past performance history in the quote. The information should include, however, discussion of any major problems encountered on the contracts listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve them. The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter.  The Gove!  rnment reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoter’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.  The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government f!  eels are most relevant to the RFQ.  The Offeror’s Past Performance will be evaluated as follows: NEUTRAL: No relevant past performance available for evaluation. Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience. Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.  OUTSTANDING: Very little to no potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror's past performance.  SATISFACTORY: Little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance.  MARGINAL: Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance.  (e) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for the performance of services provided under the Materials Testing in Aerospace Environments (MTAE) effort at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) for a period of up to 12 months.   NASA/MSFC intends to purchase these services from Integrated Concepts Research Corporation (ICRC), who is currently performing the MTAE effort at MSFC.  These services are required until such time that NASA can conduct an 8(a) competitive follow-on procurement.  This action is pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) for acquisition of supplies or services from only one source and no other supplies or service will satisfy Agency requirements for this period.  Competition is impractical at this time for the following reason: The Government anticipates competing a future acquisition using competitive 8(a) procedures.  The current effort will serve as a bridge between the existing effort and the future competitive acquisition.   Continuation of the work performed by ICRC under this contract is critical to the success of both NASA and MSFC.	It is crucial that the effort remain uninterrupted, as a break in the current contract would impact critical testing for hardware for Shuttle Missions.  Accordingly, it is in the best interest of the Government for ICRC to continue to perform this effort until such time that a follow-on contract for this requirement can be awarded under a competitive process.  Award must be made by September 1, 2006, in order to maintain continuity of services. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	(See Notes 26 and 22.) Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 8, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<SOLNBR>PR-CI-06-11028

<DESC>The U.S. EPA National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL) located in Cincinnati, Ohio intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Waters Corporation of Milford, Massachusetts for an Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatograph Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (LC/MS/MS) under the authority of FAR Part 13.106-1(b). The instrument will be used to assist researchers engaged in an active research program in the area of trace level determination of emerging contaminants (endocrine disrupting chemicals, perfluorinated surfactants, pharmaceuticals, and flame retardants) in complex environmental matrices (wastewater and animal wastes, surface and ground waters, and soils/sediments).  The capabilities provided by the required system will allow EPA to (1) develop new analytical methods for finding and detecting emerging chemical threats to environmental systems, (2) maintain data integrity of another Waters Corporation instrument EPA is currently using to perform this research in the laboratory (Waters CapLC Q-TOF MS), and (3) refine existing methods for the compounds EPA already monitors by providing higher throughput (shortening analytical methods from weeks to hours to minutes) and more sensitive analysis.  This requirement will utilize FAR Parts 12 and 13, Commercial and Simplified Acquisition Procedures.   It has been determined that the Waters Corporation Acquity UPLC Quattro Premier XE MS is the only instrument able to meet the following minimum specifications: (1) Incorporation of two quadrupole mass analyzers (MS1 and MS2) each having a mass (m/z) range of 2-3000 amu.  Because EPA is looking at oligomers and other high molecular weight species, the high range (up to 3000 amu) is required to perform routine analysis.  (2) Capable of scanning up to 5000 amu/sec.  Investing in high throughput analysis requires the fastest scanning ability to capture the sharpened peaks from the UPLC front end.  Selecting an instrument with a slower scanning ability would cause reduced data quality.   (3) Equipped with a dual APCI/ESI source with the ability to polarity switch between modes using an interscan delay of 20 ms.  The ability to polarity switch between positive and negative modes with an interscan delay of 20 ms allows for enhanced data quality derived from each and every sample run.  (4) Operation up to a pressure of 15,000 psi at 1ml/min, which enhances both the speed and sensitivity of the analysis and allows the EPA laboratory to use the latest small particle technology chromatographic columns.  This technology provides enhanced separation at greater speeds for difficult to separate compounds in environmental matrices such as human and animal wastes.  (5) Demonstrate nearly Gaussian peaks and a signal to noise ratio greater than or equal to 100:1 for a 2.5 pg on column injection of chloramphenicol while operating in negative ESI MRM with a 0.5 second dwell time over a 0 Da span.   Several EPA projects involve analyzing compounds in negative ion mode.  Market research indicates that the Waters Corporation instrument is the only vendor to list a negative ion mode spec in this sensitivity range.  Having the negative ion mode spec ensures guaranteed performance of the system.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.  However, any firm believing itself capable of providing an Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatograph Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer that meets the specifications identified above may submit technical documentation to establish their capability.  Such documentation must be submitted to Scott Tharp, Contracting Officer, within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses received will normally be considered solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  Documentation should be submitted in writing to Scott Tharp via Fax (513) 487-2107 or email Tharp.Scott@epa.gov.  Telephone responses will not be honored.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, through Simplified Acquisition Procedures, a purchase order to: Georgetown University, D/B/A Georgetown University Medical School, 37th & O Sts., NW, Washington, D.C.  The following services under NAICS Code 923110.  CMS has been tasked with developing a health education brochure which will be one of a series which provides information on prenatal care throughout pregnancy for pregnant women receiving Medicaid benefits.  The goal of the Healthy Start, Grow Smart (HSGS)initiative is to improve early childhood health for millions of America’s youngest children by improving information available to parents and caregivers about the best practices in early childhood development.  The Georgetown Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Group is uniquely qualified to take on this project for several reasons.  The MCH Group developed the HSGS Year II series.  CMS believes consistency throughout the entire HSGS series is imperative for the success of the HSGS initiative.  The HSGS Year II brochures are organized by topic areas designed to reinforce family learning (e.g., section headings across all booklets are identical, each booklet begins with a developmental description of the child to describe common issues and changes within the developmental period, each booklet concludes with a list of resources to help parents find services in their community).  CMS believes that maintaining the “look and feel” across the brochures in the series will promote identification and use of the entire series.  The MCH has a great deal of experience consistently producing high-quality print and electronic (Web-based) materials for health professionals and families.  The MCH Group developed a wealth of Bright Futures materials.  Beginning with the Bright Future guidelines, which provide an organized framework to address current and emerging health needs, practice guides in four topical areas (mental health, nutrition, oral health, and physical activity), as well as numerous other materials.  The MCH Group is well-versed in the review process, since all of its materials are reviewed by independent panels of experts in the field.  The 
MCH Group maintains the Maternal and Child Health Library, a central repository of educational materials, which allows staff immediate access to a wide range of accurate, reliable, and timely materials for reference and easy retrieval.  The library contains more than 20,000 materials, including guidelines, standards, curricula, books, booklets, and videotapes developed by agencies and organizations.  The library also includes the William McConway Hiscock Collection on the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment Program.  This is a Presidential Initiative and CMS is committed to having this series developed and ready for distribution.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Researc (CCR), Genetics Branch (GB) intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Illumina, Inc., 9885 Town Centre Drive, San Diego, CA  92121 for service and maintenance of an Illumina BeadStation.   The period of performance will be for one year with a one year option period if exercised by the Government.  The GB is engaged in the study cancer genetics and the Beadchip array analysis is an integral technique to the function of the research. By using SNP genotyping beadchips to analyze copy number alteration and loss of heterozygosity, and expression beadchips to analyze gene expression alterations, the GB is able to investigate the role that specific genes or groups of genes play to influence carcinogenesis and cancer progression in tumor and cancer cell line samples.  Repairs to the sophisticated instrument can be quite costly with labor and parts for replacement of a single laser being in excess of $50,000.  Further, moving this instrument and regular maintenance of this instrument must be accomplished by an Illumina technician or the company will rescind responsibility for support of its continued proper function.  Illumina shall provide:  1)  an annual preventive maintenance each year;  2)  unlimited emergency repair within forty-eight (48) hours;  3) furnish all required replacement parts with the exception of consumable parts at no additional cost to the Government; 4)  provide free software upgrades;  5)  provide unlimited on-site priority applications support visits for ongoing training and data analysis support;  and 6) shall provide one (1) system move and recertification each year. It is critical to the GB that the equipment is calibrated accurately and maintained according to the manufacturer’s specifications. Any deviation from the specifications could ruin countless hours of work, distort further studies. The internal components and mechanisms of this instrument are proprietary and Illumina is the only known source capable of fulfilling the service contract on this instrument.  Updates to the operating software are solely available through Illumina, and with Illumina being the manufacturer they have unlimited access to parts and technical support. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracts office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on August 3, 2006.   All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to verify questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in order to register.   In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov.   No collect calls will be accepted.

The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Army TACOM- Picatinny Arsenal, NJ has a requirement for sixteen (16) Enhanced Cover Assemblies. This firm fixed price purchase order is for the  development of an enhanced cover for the current square rim ammunition  container to redesign for weight savings as well as improve Insensitive  Munitions (IM) performance. The Army is looking to decrease/lighten the amount  of packaging material used for ammunition.  When ammunition is packed for  transport, usually you will max out in weight before cubing out, fill up  useable volume.  To increase the amount of ammunition transported the weight  from either the ammo or packaging must be reduced.  Since design changes in  ammunition is more complex than packaging, it is logical to try and reduce as  much weight as possible from the packaging while keeping its functionality and  still protect the item/s inside.  The enhanced cover will reduce the weight as  well as allow room to incorporate Insensitive Munitions (IM) feature. The  competitive Request for Quote (RFQ) will be available electronically at the  following Internet address: http://procnet.pica.army.mil on or about fifteen  (15) days from date of this announcement. The point of contact for this  requirement is Mr. Thomas Howes, Contract Specialist, AMSTA-AQ-APJ, Bldg. 10,  Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000; email: thomas.howes1@pica.army.mil ,  telephone number: 973-724-2962. SEE NUMBER NOTE 22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the  Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the  authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and  capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of  intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals  received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an  existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis  will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to  compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is  solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will  normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to  conduct a competitive procurement

<DESC>Since issuance of the Announcement/SIR No. 1 the FAA has received several questions from potential offerors seeking clarification.  Amendment #A001 (attached) to the Announcement/SIR No. 1 is issued extending the scheduled closing date for receipt of offers to August 18, 2006, in order to allow time for consideration of the questions and answers and associated changes. ------------------------------------------------------------------- The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, has a requirement for engineering, computer, and administrative support services in support of power, navigational aids, communications, surveillance, and weather systems.  The requirement is predominantly for hardware and software engineering services involved in the acquisition, restoration, maintenance, and modification of ground-based NAS equipment throughout the United States and some overseas sites.  Contractor management and personnel will be based at the MMAC in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  Requirements are defined further in a Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The current version of the PWS is provided as a separate document under this Announcement/Screening Information Request No. 1 (SIR1).  Interested parties are also encouraged to visit the MMAC Home Page.  Offers will be evaluated and contract award made on the basis of "Best Value to the FAA."  A Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF) type contract is anticipated for this acquisition.  The contract has a potential duration of five (5) years including a base year with four (4) 1-year options to be exercised at the sole discretion of the FAA. This requirement is offered to qualified, responsive, small business concerns through use of a "3-Tier" CASCADING ORDER OF PREFERENCE to determine the extent of eligible potential offerors.  Offers will be considered beginning with evaluation of Tier 1 and following with evaluations of Tiers 2 and 3, as necessary.  Tier 1 is relegated to screening of potential offerors from among Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Business (SEDB)/8(a) concerns limited to Area VI (AR, LA, NM, CO, OK, and TX).  Tier 2, if necessary, will consider nation-wide SEDB/8(a) firms.  Tier 3, if necessary, will consider nation-wide small business concerns.   The "3-Tier" process not only involves a determination of eligibility of the potential offerors at each tier, but also the number of eligible offerors from which the FAA can determine sufficient potential exists for adequate competition.  The existence of potential for adequate competition is defined as identification of at least six (6) competitive offerors from qualified, responsible business concerns at the tier under consideration from which it is anticipated that fair market prices can be obtained. If at least six (6) potential competitive offerors cannot be identified at Tier 1, then Tier 2 offerors will be considered.  If at least six (6) potential competitive offerors cannot be identified from both Tier 1 and Tier 2, Tier 3 offerors will be considered.   If a determination as to the potential for adequate competition cannot be made from Tiers 1 through 3, the FAA reserves the right to award a contract based on full and open competition.  Potential offeror(s) identified as qualified from screenings associated with Tiers 1 through 3 will be included when considering full and open competition.  The requirement will be re-announced on the FAA's website.

Should a SEDB/8(a) vendor propose a teaming arrangement, the term "vendor" applies to the prime contractor.   For those vendors contemplating entering into a joint venture please reference SBA website at http://www.sba.gov/ca/santa/sa_joint-venture_html.html.  While the FAA will be the approving authority in lieu of the SBA for any proposed joint ventures for this undertaking, the SBA standards for approving joint ventures will be employed.  All documentation to enter into a joint venture must be submitted with response to this SIR No. 1. Each firm claiming SEDB/8(a) status is required to provide a copy of its SBA 8(a) certification letter to the Contracting Officer with its response to this SIR1.  Offerors are to submit a FAA Business Declaration form with their response to this announcement.  The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each offeror's program eligibility. In conjunction with the set-aside nature of the requirement, at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the prime contractor.  This requirement is found in AMS Clause 3.6.1-7, Limitation on Subcontracting.   This acquisition contemplates a phased approach.  This, the initial phase, involves the announcement/SIR1 of the requirement.  Only those firms that respond successfully to this SIR1 will be allowed to participate in the next phase.  The remaining phase(s) of the downselect process will be identified in future communications with those firms that successfully respond to this SIR1.   Companies that are interested and possess certain special standards of responsibility are to provide specific information as to the unique capabilities to be brought to the performance of this requirement.  The specific information provided must be accurate and complete because it will be used to determine each vendor's eligibility to participate.  Documentation must be provided to substantiate any statement of fact that goes to the vendor's eligibility pursuant to this SIR1.  The FAA reserves the right to contact references and verify each vendor's information.  Any statement included in a vendor's response that is verified by the FAA as either false or misleading will be cause for rejection.  Documentation includes, but is not limited to, formal resumes, licenses, financial statements, work plans, etc.  All documentation is limited to 25 pages (8-1/2"x11", printed on one side).  The 25-page limit only applies to the technical proposal (financial statements are exempt from the page limit of 25).  Failure to comply with this page limitation may be cause for rejection of a vendor's response.  CAUTION: FAA evaluators will read only up to the page limit as specified.  Four copies are requested.  Mere statements of compliance or intention to comply are unacceptable.  All responses submitted must address the capability of the vendor to meet the special standards of responsibility.   SPECIAL STANDARDS OF RESPONSIBILITY: The following information must be addressed in each vendor's submission in order for the FAA to determine a vendor's eligibility to participate further in any subsequent SIR.   (Note: Each submission will be evaluated on an "acceptable/unacceptable" basis.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) on Collapsible Shipping and Storage Containers, 800 lbs.   This announcement constitutes an official Request for Information (RFI) as defined in FAR 15.201(c).  The intent of the RFI is to identify potential suppliers of containers capable of ultimately providing this requirement in large quantities for the Department of Defense.  It is the Navy's intention to procure small quantities of approximately 4 different containers for test and evaluation (Needed in Nov/Dec 06).  Following test and evaluation, a procurement of several hundred containers for use in a military exercise is planned (needed by Feb/Mar 07) in conjunction with a Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD).  This JCTD is evaluating the Joint Modular Intermodal Container (JMIC) as part of the Joint Modular Intermodal Distribution System (JMIDS). JMIC is expected to be a family of containers potentially including both heavy duty containers (for materials such as ordnance), and lighter duty containers (the subject of this solicitation). If that evaluation demonstrates effectiveness of the JMIC concept, and of the procured containers, the Department of Defense may procure large quantities of similar containers, for general use within the Defense Transportation System (FY-08 and beyond).  The future containers will have a common footprint and interface and may also include other heights as well as multiples of the basic footprints for items too large to fit within the basic footprint (double long, double wide, etc).

This is neither a Request for Proposal (RFP) nor an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor can there be any claims levied against the Government as a result of any information submitted by respondents.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.   Potential uses for the information received may result in future Request for Quotation’s (RFQs), but knowledge of this cannot be construed in any way as a commitment by the Government.  

Container performance requirements and referenced drawings are  accessed at www.neco.navy.mil under solicitation number RFIN001402006800LBS.  Vendors should submit their responses electronically NLT 31 July 2006 to the following: Daniel.damanskis@navy.mil.  Phone: 215.697.9730, Fax 215.697.9574 

Paragraph 2.2.3 and 2.2.8 of the specification are revised as follows:

2.2.3	Repetitive Shock Test (Superimposed Load).  The loaded prototype (800 pounds), with an identical prototype, loaded to 800 pounds placed on top, fully assembled and in its normal shipping condition shall be placed on but not fastened to the test platform.  Restraining devices shall be attached to the platform to prevent the prototype from moving off the platform and, if necessary, to prevent excessive rocking of the prototype.  The restraining devices should be adjusted to permit unrestrained movement of the prototype from its centered position about 1/2-inch in any horizontal direction.  With the prototype in one position, vibrate the platform at 1/2-inch amplitude starting at the frequency of about 3 cycles per second.  Steadily increase the frequency until the base of the top prototype leaves the top of the bottom prototype (i.e., a 1/16-inch thick feeler may be momentarily slid freely between every point on the top load and the bottom prototype at some instant during each cycle).  If circular input motion is used, table frequency shall be adjusted to assure that one edge of the prototype leaves the table not less than 3/16-inch on each cycle.  This test shall be conducted for a period of two hours. 
The function of the prototype shall not be impaired when subjected to the above test.  Evidence of one or more of the following will be cause for rejection:
a.	Damage or failure to the container to permit continued safe handling.
b.	Failure of the container design to retain its contents.
c.	Damage to the container which would preclude removal of the contents by its intended means.
d.	Permanent deformation of any portion of the container that affects its functional performance throughout the anticipated life cycle.
e.	Damage to the container's hoisting/interfacing features which would allow the containers to become unattached or separated.



2.2.8	Stacking Strength.  The prototype container design shall be fully loaded with its simulated load.  The prototype shall be placed on its bottom on a flat, level, rigid surface.  A load shall be applied to the top of the container prototype in a manner simulating the effect of similar containers being stacked on top to replicate a situation of 3 high (1600 pounds placed on top of the bottom prototype).  The bearing surface of the top superimposed load shall be on the same load-bearing areas that the base areas would make on the container top.  The load shall remain in place for a period of one hundred sixty-eight (168) hours under the climatic conditions of 120°F and 90% relative humidity if the material is susceptible to performance degradation at these environmental conditions.  If the material is not susceptible to degradation at these environmental conditions the load shall remain in place for 1 hour.  
The function of the prototype design shall not be impaired when subjected to the above test.  Evidence of one or more of the following will be cause for rejection:
a.	Damage or failure to the container to permit continued safe handling.
b.	Failure of the container to retain its contents.
c.	Damage to the container which would preclude removal of the contents by its intended means.
d.	Permanent deformation of any portion of the container that affects its functional performance throughout the anticipated life cycle.
e.	Damage to the container's hoisting/interfacing features which would allow the containers to become unattached or separated.

<DESC>The purpose of this ammendment is to change the 100% small business set aside to unrestricted (the non-manufacturer rule applies).
==================================================================

The government intends to issue a Firm Fixed Price request for quotes (RFQ) for services (including labor) and materials for the installation of a complete fire suppression system into three separate computer rooms. The fire suppression system will be in support of data facilities with Automated Data Processing Equipment (ADPE) installed with existing fire alarm indicators. There will need to be site surveys conducted. 

The approximate sizes of the three rooms by volume are as follows: 3696 ft3, 4054 ft3 and 1200 ft3, respectively. Systems shall use the Brand name Fenwal FM – 200 suppression systems, manufactured by Fenwal Protection Systems, 400 Main Street, Ashland, MA 01721 or an equal product/agent to negate hazards and facility restrictions of Halon and provide suppression without damaging APDE. The system should be able to tie into existing fire alarm for indicators only and incorporate both visual and audible alarms. Systems should be equipped to shut down HVAC systems to each of the three rooms.

<DESC>The following two questions were submitted to the Government.  The questions and their answers are provided below for your information:
Question 1:  The Presolicitation notice implies that the system should include “the On-Board Receiver and Data Processor normally carried on the aerial vehicle” which implies that the equipment is airworthy and passes flight safety requirements. Is this a requirement of the contract?   
Answer:  The subject solicitation is for a prototype system that can be tested in an environmental chamber, tested at an instrumented tower and tested as a payload on a helium- filled balloon.  If these test results are positive and if resources are available, the government may issue one or more other solicitations to make the prototype equipment suitable to be carried on manned or unmanned high altitude aerial vehicles.
Question 2:  Does the Ultralight Dropsonde System that the Government plans to acquire presently exist?
Answer:  No

DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK FOR INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT CONTRACT FOR
THE USAID OFFICE OF FOOD FOR PEACE


A.	BACKGROUND

The Office of Food for Peace (FFP) of the U.S. Agency for International Development’s Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA), provides administrative, technical and financial oversight for the Public Law 480 (P.L. 480) Title II program. Title II represents the largest amount of United States Government (USG) resources committed to global food insecurity, providing over $7 billion of assistance since 2001. FFP makes available Title II resources to private voluntary organizations (PVOs), international organizations (IO), primarily the World Food Program (WFP), and foreign governments to address food insecurity resulting from short term emergencies and longer term development problems in food deficit countries. 

Title II programs operate in an environment characterized by increased frequency and severity of natural and manmade disasters; the heightened diplomatic, military and humanitarian demands on the U.S., including the war on terrorism; and the destabilizing potential of HIV/AIDS, conflict, and increased numbers of refugees and internally displaced persons. 

Under the new FFP Strategy Plan for 2006-2010 (www.usaid.gov/hum_response/ffp), FFP has expanded its basic food security conceptual framework to make explicit the risks (economic, social, health and political risks as well as natural shocks) that impede progress toward improvements in food availability, access and utilization.  

Efforts to improve the measurement of Title II impact will continue under the new strategy.  This will include activities to assess the impact of the program on the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) goal to reduce the prevalence of underweight children under five and improve the measures of food access and community coping capacity.  FFP will also put more emphasis on knowledge management under the new strategy, expanding its knowledge of what works and why and using this knowledge to influence policy and improve program impact in the field.  Under the new strategy, Title II programs will fall into one of two categories:  Single-Year Assistance Programs (SYAPs) or Multi-Year Assistance Programs (MYAPs) (www.usaid.gov/hum_response/ffp).  

B.	OVERALL OBJECTIVES

The contractor shall assist FFP to achieve its strategic objective through the realization of the following objectives: 

Objective 1: 	Provide administrative, technical, and program support in the planning, implementation, management, monitoring and evaluation of Public Law (P.L.) 480 Title II SYAPs and MYAPs. 

Objective 2:  	Provide technical support to the Program Operations Division for calls forward, procurement tracking, booking, shipping, budget analysis and presentations.

Objective 3:	Support the review, administrative, monitoring and evaluation process for FFP’s Institutional Support Assistance programs to Cooperating Sponsors (CS).

Objective 4:	Support the planning, organization, and follow-up actions to the Food Aid Consultative Working Group.

Objective 5: 	Assist FFP to develop a standard training package and help modify or develop technical training modules and facilitate training sessions related to P.L. 480 Title II food aid program implementation, monitoring and evaluation. 			 

Objective 6: 	Provide administrative and information support in the areas of report writing and material updates, as well as modify (or develop) and implement a public relations, communication and outreach strategy for FFP.  

Objective 7: 	Provide operational support. 



C.       CONTRACT TYPE

<DESC>The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has developed a patented technology that processes natural gas into liquefied natural gas (LNG) by means of a small-scale liquefaction plant, (e.g. 10-40,000 gallons/day). The plant's compact size enables local production of LNG and thus avoids or reduces transportation and handling costs. The liquefaction process has been designed, engineered and tested on a prototype scale, and is now available for licensing to qualified companies. Companies having interest to negotiate a license to practice the technology should contact the INL on or before September 30, 2006. Ideal candidates should have internal capabilities that include: design/engineering, packaging/fabrication and service/support. Domestic and foreign jurisdictions are available for licensing.

Beauregard St., Suite 300, Alexandria, VA  22311. The purpose of this contract is to  continue with the next phase, Phase II, of designing a performance management tool that helps AHRQ to improve its strategic management process.  Phase II will continue to draw upon the program performance and management of data (Phase I) by:  1) moving the Visual Performance Suite (VPS) from the Plexus site and installing on an AHRQ server; 2) configuring and implementing VPS; 3) generating additional custom reports including GPRA Budget Report, Goal Linkages Report, and summary of Measures Report; 4) integrating AHRQ'S budget and grantee data into VPS; 5) developing user manuals; and, 6) conducting VPS Training.

Currently this software and AHRQ performance data are hosted on the Plexus site as this company is the only vendor that sells the Visual Performance Suite.  They do not have any resellers at this time.  In addition, their professional services staff is the only consulting organization certified to provide the implementation and consulting services associated with the VPS solution as the tool is moved from the Plexus site to AHRQ's IT system during Phase II of the contract.  Interested parties should fax a written request to the Contracting Officer at 301-427-1740 no later than 1:00pm on August 8, 2006.  All responses will be considered by AHRQ.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (formerly the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Medstat Group, 125 Cambridge Park Drive, Cambridge, MA 02140. The purpose of this contract is to: (1) conduct a state-of-the-art environmental scan and science-based assessment of measures and instruments that could be used to (or could be adapted to) assess quality of care and associated outcomes of home and community-based long-term care services, and (2) document the findings.  Contractors statement of work (SOW) shall include (1) establishing and convening a Technical Expert Panel (TEP), (2) designing and implementing a methodology for obtaining measures, (3) designing and implementing a methodology for evaluating measures, (4) documenting the findings, and (5) obtaining peer review and stakeholder input.  The estimated period of performance is for 18 months.  For the last five years Medstat has been CMS's lead National Quality Contractor for Medicaid HCBS. In this role Medstat provides technical assistance to State Medicaid HCBS programs - to assist the states in designing and implementing quality assurance and improvement efforts (Q A/I).  As such, Medstat staff have developed an unique understanding of state Medicaid programs and their diverse and complex mechanisms for HCBS QA/I, the measures that are used in HCBS Q A/I, HCBS programs that are currently developing/implementing new Q A/I methods, and how HCBS Q A/I programs and associated quality measures vary widely across HCBS participant populations, the states and HCBS providers. A majority of the HCBS Quality Tools (including measures) provided on the CMS web site were developed utilizing the technical expertise of Medstat staff.  Among the nine HCBS Quality Letters issued by CMS to the State Medicaid Directors, five of the letters specifically mention Medstat or Medstat developed quality measures and tools. Medstat's staff expertise includes the authorship of numerous reports related to measuring HCBS quality including "A Review of Measures Relevant to the Home and Community-Based Waiver Programs" (2000), "Summary of Results: National Quality Inventory Survey of HCBS Waiver Programs" (2004), and "Development of the Participant Experience Survey (PES)" (2005).  The intent of this Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) contract (undertaken in support of AHRQ's legislative mandate as specified in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005) is to access measures that use (or could be used) to assess the quality of services provided as Medicaid HCBS.  Medstat's technical expertise and Medstat's experience as the National Quality Contractor for Medicaid HCBS uniquely qualify Medstat to provide the technical expertise AHRQ requires for this AHRQ SOW.  This level of expertise is especially important given the time frame mandated for AHRQ under the DRA mandate to develop HCBS quality of care measures, assess HCBS services and disseminate best practices.  Interested parties should fax a written request to the Contracting Officer at 301-427-1740 no later than 1:00pm on August 8, 2006.  All responses will be considered by AHRQ.  Telephone requests will not be honored.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SYNOPSIS TO ADVERTISE A SOLICITATION THAT IS READY FOR RELEASE, rather the purposes are (a) to determine whether there are a sufficient number of responsible sources and (b) to conduct market research.  The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is seeking information on companies that have the capability to employ the General Campaign Analysis Model (GCAM) for the purpose of investigating and quantifying the relative benefits of technologies and concepts that might be proposed to improve Coast Guard effectiveness across its mission areas. Example technologies and concepts include unmanned platforms, improved radar, and network centric operations.  Example missions include drug interdiction, search and rescue, and anti-terrorist force protection.  The kind of simulation modeling desired allows for an analysis to be conducted in an integrated system context that incorporates force structure, concept of operations, asset capabilities, infrastructure vulnerabilities, command and control, tactics, sensors, and threat capability. Of critical importance is having the capability to understand, modify, and efficiently adapt existing Coast Guard GCAM based models to conduct trade-off analyses for different operational and technology options.  In addition, the capability to utilize new GCAM features such as sensor coverage and route optimization is required. GCAM was developed and is maintained by Systems Planning and Analysis, Inc. (SPA) www.spa-inc.net/gcam.htm. Companies or subject matter experts having specific experience in the use, development, and application of General Campaign Analysis Model (GCAM) are encouraged to submit responses to this announcement.  Responses to this market research shall include the following:  (1) Please describe the capabilities and infrastructure components that meet the capabilities listed above (limit 6 pages). (2) Please describe company history with regard to how the experience was obtained or developed (limit 1 page).  This announcement is not a research or development project.  The purpose of this announcement is NOT to develop or evaluate potential new products, services or facilities, or to improve existing facilities for the purpose of meeting the specific performance capabilities or objectives. At this stage, the Government has no intention to further develop or produce any equipment from the information received.  Information collected through this announcement will be reviewed by individuals from the USCG.  Responses to this market survey shall be sent directly to: Helen.R.Nelson@uscg.mil with a copy to Kevin.F.Downer@uscg.mil.  Only electronic responses will be accepted and shall be submitted no later than 25 August 2006.

<DESC>MILITARY CONSTRUCTION (MILCON) CENTERS OF STANDARDIZATION NATIONWIDE PROGRAM INFORMATION:  This is an advance notice concerning the hosting of four regional Industry Day Forums in order to perform market research on Request(s) for Proposal(s) that ma y be issued in support of the Centers of Standardization Military Construction (MILCON) Program.   The Army is undertaking a significant shift in emphasis and prioritization with respect to resources and priorities.  This shift is driven by a reassessment of the strategic and operational environments and the Armys responsibilities to provide relevant a nd ready land power capabilities to commanders as part of the Joint Force now and in the future.  To realize the objectives of the emphasis shift, the Army is pursuing the most comprehensive transformation of its forces since the early years of World War I I.  The transformation is intended to move the legacy force into a new modular, more expeditionary and more lethal entity capable of quickly responding to our nations future threats.  A key component to this initiative is the standing up of Centers of Sta ndardization and standard designs for 41facility types.  USACE, in achieving the Armys objectives, is requesting market research information to allow responsible Districts to support the acquisition strategy for each facility type.  In order to accomplish this, USACE will conduct four regional Industry Day forums and will implement an internet-based market research questionnaire to gather and provide information regarding the Center of Standardization (CoS) MILCON needs.  This questio nnaire need only be completed one time for the entire MILCON COSProgram.  This information will be gathered according to the Armys Installation Management Agencys (IMA) four regions which are: Northeast Region (NER), Northwest Region (NWR), Southeast Reg ion (SER), and Southwest Region (SWR).  Please see the market research website for a map of the states covered by each of the IMAs regions.  Details about the market survey, including its internet address, will be forthcoming in the form of a Sources Soug ht on or about July 24th.  INFORMATION GATHERED RELATIVE TO THIS PROGRAM WILL PERMIT ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE METHOD(S) OF PROCUREMENT AND INPUT IS DESIRED FROM ALL INTERESTED PARTIES.  THIS INCLUDES CONTRACTORS, INDUSTRY ORGANIZATIONS, ASSOCIATIONS OR SOCIETIES.  This Construction  Program will consist of Mission Facilities for the Army (Barracks, Dining Facilities, Headquarters Buildings, Company Operations Facilities, Tactical Operations Facilities, Unit Storage, Ammo Storage, Paving/Roads & Parking, Aviation Operation Facilities,  Classrooms, Training Ranges) as well as community facilities for the Families (Child Development Centers, Chapels, Fitness Facilities, etc.) to support the Centers of Standardization Army MILCON requirements nationwide.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with IPG Photonics Corporation, 50 Old Webster Road, Oxford, MA 01540 for an off-resonant high power laser to trap atoms. Specifically, a laser is needed that has the following characteristics: 
1064 nm wavelength; a single frequency; and 20W of power. Currently NIST is using a 1064nm laser for the trapping of atoms that has 4W of power. However, for future experiments, NIST needs up to 20W of power. Also, the current laser has a very broad linewidth, which according to recent theoretical work could be a detriment to the experimental conditions. To eliminate these problems, NIST needs a narrow linewidth laser, with a linewidth of less than 100kHz, and the ability to tune the frequency at least 100's of GHz. This linewidth will give a sufficiently long coherence length to implement an optical lattice for our experiment. The laser should also have a single linear polarization. The trapping of atoms in the 1064 nm laser is an instrumental part of the experiment. The laser needs to be reproducible in power, frequency and polarization from day-to-day.  Also, due to limited lab space the laser and laser controller needs to be small with a minimal heat load. The laser controller should be mountable in a standard 19 inch equipment rack and run off of 110V AC power. For implementation into the current setup the laser light should be delivered via an optical fiber. The past performance of alternative fiber lasers tested have proven to be unreliable.

This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Under $100,000). This synopsis is issued for information purposes. Questions should be submitted in writing to the contracting officer either by fax or email before August 9, 2006. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. Anticipated award date will be August 10, 2006.

<DESC>Description: Development, production and distribution of organ donor awareness campaigns to outreach on college and high school campuses.

The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is conducting a sources sought synopsis to locate capable organizations implementing Donate Life Campaigns on college campuses and high schools.
  
On April 17, 2001, the Department of Health and Human announced the beginning of a new national initiative to increase organ, tissue, marrow, and blood donation.  This initiative included a charge to educate the Nation’s youth and young adults about organ and tissue donation. College youth are at an age when they begin to see their connection to the larger community beyond their own family and neighborhood.  Learning about creating a donation friendly America at this time in their lives will contribute to their understanding of what it means to be a responsible citizen.

HRSA has supported several projects to encourage donation among college students.  In addition, college focused projects have been conducted by other entities in the donation community.  College students themselves have created action groups on campuses across the country.  It is particularly important that donation education and information be made available to high school students as they will, in almost every state, be asked to indicate a “donation decision” at the time they apply for a driver’s license.  High school students need to be well informed and understand the issues surrounding donation and transplantation before they are faced with making that decision.    

The tasks to be carried out under any resultant contract require not only expertise in the field of organ donation awareness, but also experience with running peer education programs, particularly involving young adult peer leaders. The organization must be able to engage school faculty, parents and students to indicate that they will be organ donors.  The organization must demonstrate a National capability to coordinate National Donor Awareness activities, such as the Donate Life Week and National Donate Life Month.   The organization must provide leadership and strategies to institutions and groups participating in such campaigns.  They must work with local organ procurement and other donation organizations to incorporate student efforts into their plans. 

Interested organizations should submit their capability statements demonstrating their capability to perform this work in sufficient detail to assess their ability.   Potential contractors must have in-depth knowledge and thorough understanding of developing organ donor awareness campaigns, knowledge of behavior and issues related to living and deceased donation and ability to plan content and present donation information to college and high school age youth and young adults.  

Interested organizations must demonstrate and document, in any capability statements submitted, extensive experience with, and the ability to perform, the above tasks.  Organizations should demonstrate capability to administer and coordinate interrelated tasks in an effective and timely manner.  Documentation may include, but not be limited to, Government and commercial contracts, providing references (with Names, telephone numbers, and email address) and any other information serving to document the organization's capability.

Your submission must be received in this office by 2:00 PM on August 4, 2006, by post office mail, email or fax at the following address:  HHS/HRSA;  Attn:  Jeffrey Johnston  5600 Fishers Lane, Room 13A19;  Rockville, MD 20857;  Tel (301) 443-2750;  Fax (301) 443-5462, or jjohnston@hrsa.gov.  The capability statements shall be not more than twenty-five (25) pages, on 8.5” x 11” paper, with 1” margins and a 12 point, commonly used font such as, Courier or Times Roman in length.

THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT COMMITTED TO AWARD A CONTRACT PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  RESPONSES SHALL NOT INCLUDE COST OR PRICING INFORMATION.

	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is seeking potential offerors who have the capabilities of procuring Opportunistic Infection Drugs (OI) and Home Based Care Drugs & Products within and for Vietnam.  The Government intends to award an Unpriced Firm Fixed-Price Purchase Order that will consist of a 6 month base period with four six month option period.  The offerors will be required to undertake the product procurement through an open quotation system.  The products are procured on open bid, with a minimum of three quotations required for each product.  The product with the lowest cost, which can meet all of the specifications and quality requirement, is then procured. Attached A is a sample list of OI Drugs that may be required to be purchased under the purchase order.
	
	Under Vietnam law and regulation only a registered and licensed pharmaceutical distributor may undertake physical distribution of pharmaceutical products. Additionally, PEPFAR Vietnam is currently operating in 40 provinces of Vietnam with a wide geographical range from the far Northern area to the far Southern area of the country – a longitudinal spread of around 2,000 Kms.  The contractor must be able to operate over a wide geographical range.
	
	The volume of medicines to be provided by PEPFAR, although small in comparison to the total country requirement, is nevertheless a significant proportion in relation to the central level public sector supply. Therefore the contractor must currently have high capacity volume capabilities and have adequate capacity to store and undertake the physical distribution volumes of medicines required by PEPFAR Vietnam.

	Because a number of treatment sites have very low storage capacity for medicines, it is a requirement that the contractor store medicines and undertake frequent small deliveries to the treatment sites. Further, storage is required to hold emergency stocks and buffer stocks against possible unforeseen circumstances and erratic usage patterns.

It is a Ministry of Health (MoH) requirement, {Extraordinary Letter No. 6036/QLD-CL Ministry of Health, Drug Administration of Vietnam, Attention: Pharmaceutical Companies, enterprises attaining Good Practices (GPs)} that all new operations, must use only storage facilities that have ASEAN (Association of South-East Asian Nations) GSP (Good Storage Practice) certification.

It is a MoH and MoF requirement that all proposed medicine distribution must be approved in advance by both Ministries.

All offerors who are to procure, store and distribute medicines destined for use within the public sector of Vietnam must receive specific approval for each activity from both the MoH and MoF.

Interested firms are invited to submit a statement of capability demonstrating their experience, capability and all Governmental approvals to fulfill the Government’s requirement.  The statement of capabilities should be limited to five (5) pages and should include: company name, company address, contact name, contact telephone number, contact fax number, and contact email address.
     
One copy of the capability statement must be received at the address listed below no later then 15 calendar days from date posted on FedBizOpps (July 25, 2006).  Capability statements should be sent to: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Procurements and Grants Office (PGO), Mail Stop, K75 Attn: John Ebanks, Contract Specialist, 2920 Brandywine Rd, Atlanta, GA 30341-5539 or by electronic mail to egz2@cdc.gov.

Responses via facsimile (FAX) WILL NOT be accepted.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes ONLY and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, or will the Government pay for information solicited.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether more than one firm possesses the capability to fulfill the Governments requirement.  A determination by the Government to compete this requirement based upon responses to this synopsis is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>1.  Scope 

The 685th Armament Systems Squadron (685 ARSS) seeks sources for a multiple delay, hardened fuze for use in the BLU-121A/B General Purpose Bomb and various hard target penetrator bombs.  All responsible sources are invited to submit a white paper describing their proposed hard target fuze, their level of expertise in hard target fuze design, and a synopsis of their past performance in bomb fuze production.
  
2.  Background

The Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Directorate (AFRL/MN) and the 685th ARSS developed a 2000-lb bomb designed to hold tunnel-type targets at risk by skipping into the tunnel entrance and penetrating the blast door prior to exploding.  The bomb is designated as the BLU-121A/B General Purpose Bomb.  The BLU-121 warhead case is fabricated from ES-1C steel, a very high strength steel, to enable it to survive the skip and penetration. The external appearance and dimensions of the BLU-121A/B are very nearly the same as those of the MK-84 General Purpose Bomb.  The improvements over the current MK-84 include the high strength case, the addition of a structural nose cover, a modified aft end similar to that of the BLU-109/B Penetrator, and AFX-757 explosive which is more insensitive and produces more explosive energy than the Tritonal explosive used in the MK-84.  Although there are plans to test other guidance kits, the BLU-121A/B is currently employed only with the EGBU-15 guidance kit.

The BLU-121 has both front and rear fuze wells, but it is currently fuzed only with an FMU-143N/B Fuze in the rear fuze well.  Electrical power for the fuze is provided by the bomb guidance kit.  The FMU-143N/B is identical to the FMU-143G/B except for markings and the booster pellet which is pressed from PBXN-11 explosive.  PBXN-11, a very high output explosive, is required to reliably initiate the AFX-757 fill in the bomb.

The Air Force is beginning to develop the FMU-143P/B and the FMU-143Q/B Fuzes.  The P/B will be identical to the N/B except the rotor assembly will be improved for reliability.  The Q/B will also be the same except it will have 120 ms delay instead of the 60 ms delay.  Because of their improved reliability, once the P/B fuzes are fielded, they will be used (unless a better fuze is identified) instead of the N/B for the BLU-121.

The Warfighter has identified a need for the BLU-121 to travel further before detonating.  Therefore there is a need for fuzes with longer delays.   The Q/B fuze will provide a 120ms delay, but there is also a need for a fuze with a 90 ms delay. A nose fuze for the BLU-121 is needed to further increase reliability and to better shape/focus the blast output of the bomb.  The nose fuze in a BLU-121A/B will be encapsulated behind the Structural Nose Cap, 18894-20057703.  Therefore the fuze must be capable of being classified as “SAFE” without visual inspection or a “REMOVE BEFORE FLIGHT” lanyard.

3.  Objectives

Identify a suitable fuze system for use in the nose and tail of the BLU-121A/B Bomb.  If a suitable nose/tail fuze is identified, it will likely be used in hard target penetrator bombs as well as in the BLU-121A/B.  The fuze identified may be an existing fuze, a 

SSS - - FUZE for BLU-121						                         Page 3


modified version of an existing fuze, or a currently planned new fuze. The fuze must either be capable of being built with 60, 90, and 120 ms delays, or it must have selectable 60, 90, and 120 ms delays.  The contractor should provide recommendations to arm/power nose and tail fuzing (i.e. a bomb fuze initiator and cable, or a cable to connect the front and rear fuzes to conduct power from the bomb guidance kit to the front fuze), using current design and plumbing features of the BLU-121A/B.   

4.  White Papers

This is not a Request for Proposal - White Papers only are requested at this time.  Interested parties are requested to provide your company name and CAGE code, contact’s phone number, and email address by 4 August 2006 to Grisselle Nusimow, grisselle.nusimow@eglin.af.mil.  White papers will be accepted until 4pm CDT on 3 November 2006.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.
 
5.  Preparation Instructions.  Offerors are invited to submit white papers to address their proposal to meet the objectives discussed in paragraph 3, their expertise in hard target fuze design, and a synopsis of their past performance in bomb fuze production. Offerors are requested to submit an electronic copy to both 685th ARSS Technical Focal Points listed below.  The white paper should be formatted as follows: Section A:  Title, Name of Company, Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, Technical contact and Contracts contact with appropriate phone numbers, fax numbers, and e-mail addresses; Section B:  Task Objective with technical summary.  If hazardous materials/processes would be required for the technology proposed, so state; Section C:  Technical Expertise Summary, and Section D:  Past Performance Summary.  Please submit white papers in Microsoft Word format, single spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch.  If the offeror wishes to restrict distribution of its white paper, it must be marked with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a) and (b).

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY LARGE AREA IMAGER
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
LARGE AREA IMAGER


Opportunity:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to partner with LLNL to further develop and deploy its Large Area Imager (LAI) technology. This technology addresses applications associated with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Defense (DOD), and DOE.

Background: One of the major challenges faced by the DHS is the remote detection of radioactive materials that could be used in a nuclear or radiological weapon of mass destruction. Traditional technologies rely on large detectors and proximity imaging (i.e., associating the source location with the location at which count rates are highest). Such techniques are susceptible to local variations in background count rates, and thus have high false-alarm rates or low sensitivity. The LAI technology uses a one-dimensional, coded-aperture imaging system to overcome this difficulty. The imaging allows background variations associated with distributed sources (e.g., building, geology, etc.) to be ignored while allowing compact sources to be localized. In fact, such a source is located in two dimensions (location along direction of travel and range from imager,) using parallax information in conjunction with the image processing.

In preparation for possible future solicitations from the US Government for an advanced demonstration of this technology, LLNL is seeking potential commercial partners that could respond to such a solicitation.

Description:  LLNL designed and tested a proof-of-principle prototype that has been used to establish the potential for this technology. A second prototype is being constructed to demonstrate the ability to detect sources at long ranges on both sides of a vehicle with a single detector array. Both prototypes use arrays of alkali-halide scintillation detectors behind a coded array of lead elements providing a unique shadow pattern on the detectors for each possible source location. Custom electronics have been implemented to control the system and acquire data.

Potential Applications:  This technology can be used in a search instrument for locating lost or hidden radiation sources. 

Development Status:  The second prototype is in the final stages of integration and testing. It will subsequently be characterized in the upcoming months. To view pictures of prototype go to http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/technology/profile/announcement/Large-Area-Imager.php

LLNL is seeking industrial partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  

Please visit the IPAC website at http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process.  

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Parties interested in working with LLNL on developing and licensing the Large Area Imager technology must respond in writing to LLNL by August 14, 2006 addressing each of the items listed below.  

1.	Name of company, location(s) and descriptions including
a.	Recent annual report or other overview of your organization and the team that you are proposing

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY Gradient Porous Composite Membrane for Fuel Cell Applications
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
Gradient Porous Composite Membrane 
for Fuel Cell Applications

Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to jointly research, develop and commercialize a novel composite membrane electrolyte and membrane electrode assembly technology for fuel cells. LLNL, in collaboration with a team of Russian scientists, is seeking an industrial partner to participate in a GIPP sponsored program to develop and commercialize the new membrane technology. LLNL proposes to work with Russian scientists who have demonstrated the key polymer chemistry and composition makeup of the membrane technology and a U.S. Company to develop the new membrane technology for commercialization within the fuel cell industry.

Background: Present proton conducting membranes and membrane electrode assemblies fall short of DOE requirements for performance, operating temperature, water/humidity requirements, and cost to meet long term objectives for automotive and stationary fuel cell power systems. Commercially available proton conducting membranes representing the industry standard remain expensive, require humidification, and have limited performance for temperatures >80°C. 

Description:   The heart of current polymer electrolyte fuel cells are the membrane electrode assemblies (MEA), which are composed of (i) an ionomer polymer membrane which serves as a proton-conductor and separator in the cell; (ii) noble metal catalysts, which are typically applied as an ink to the ionomer membrane and/or (iii) the gas diffusion material which is in contact with the membrane or membrane’s catalyst layer. 

The novel ionomer membranes are based on composite materials of Co- or polyheteroarylenes with gradient-porous oxide (titania, silica, alumina, zirconia, for example) matrixes. Compared to existing commercial membranes the new ionomer membranes exhibit high ionic conductivity and chemical stability along with reduction in hydrogen crossover. These materials potentially offer advantages that include reduced hydrogen and oxygen crossover, improved dimensional satiability as films and water management, good ionic conductivities at low water retention compared to the industry standard. These attributes should result in improved performance as well as higher thermal and chemical resistance. 

The novel membrane structure also has advantages over the standard composite laminate structure. The gradient porous membrane structure overcomes performance problems typical of composite materials: 1) template synthesis, and 2) physical integrity under extreme operating conditions. The gradient porous membrane consists of a porous composite which becomes the support for the ionomer that is embedded within the porous matrix from a gel formulation. The porous matrix serves to stabilize the polymer ion conducting membrane both mechanically and chemically, and further provides a high surface area catalyst and electrode support for the membrane electrode assembly.

Advantages:  The new technology is most advantageous where the performance and cost become critical factors. The new proton conducting membranes promise increased protonic conductivity with less water requirements, improved performance and stability above 120°C, improved mechanical, thermal, and chemicalstability, and reduced cost of production. Commercialization of this new membrane, and MEA technology could provide improved ionic conductivity and range of operation for all applications, and ultimately reduction of component count for fuel cell designs.

Potential Applications:  The gradient porous composite membrane will find application for a range of fuel cell technologies for portable, automotive, and stationary fuel cell power systems. The features and benefits detailed below for these applications.

Features/Benefits:
1) Increased ionic conductivity/Higher power density, reduced surface area, stack size

2) Lower water retention/Increased temperature range (>120°C)
Reduced swelling, better mechanical stability

3) Gradient porous composite support structure/Improved mechanical stability, reduced component count

Development Status:  Present testing has demonstrated improved ionic conductivity of the new membrane composition in comparison to the industry standard. Membrane electrode assemblies have been tested under various conditions to demonstrate competitive performance at room temperatures. 

LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market.

<SUBJECT>B -- STUDY FORAGING BEHAVIOR AND DEMOGRAPHY OF PYGOSCELIS PENGUINS
<DESC>Notice of intent to negotiate a sole source contract with Susan Trivelpiece for NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service located in La Jolla, CA. The purpose of proposed contract is: 

BACKGROUND

The Antarctic Marine Living Resources Convention Act of 1984 (Title III of Pub.L. 98-623, 16 U.S.C. 2431 et seq.) Provides the legislative authority necessary to implement, with respect to the United States, the Antarctic Marine Living Resources (AMLR) Program.  The AMLR Program, which is managed by the Antarctic Ecosystem Research Group (AERG) at the Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC), provides information to the U.S. delegation to the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), part of the Antarctic treaty system.

CCAMLR is an international treaty between 23 nations that seeks to manage Antarctic fisheries with the goal of preserving species diversity and stability of the entire Antarctic marine ecosystem.  In keeping with this objective, CCAMLR has designated areas of research that member nations are obligated to pursue.  The AMLR Program has identified specific data sets that must be collected to respond to CCAMLR’s research directives.  In doing so, the AMLR Program supports the U.S. Government’s commitment to CCAMLR.

In 1996/97, the AMLR Program, in cooperation with the NSF, began providing logistical support for the NSF field camp at Admiralty Bay, King George Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica.  Within the vicinity of this study area, the AMLR program has a large-area survey grid.  The NSF field camp and study area are adjacent to an area where reproductive success and feeding ecology of breeding penguins have been monitored since 1976.  

  Overall Program Objectives

The NSF/AMLR cooperative program monitors a suite of predators, primarily penguins at the Copacabana field site and formulates management advice to CCAMLR.  In addition, the Program conducts field research designed to describe the functional relationships between krill (Euphausia superba), their predators, and key environmental variables.

  Specific Study Objectives

The objectives of the research covered by this contract include the following:

(1)	to initiate and direct the seabird research and assist the PI with collecting standardized data related to penguin and seabird reproduction, growth, abundance and distribution, and survival;
(2)	to participate in the data analysis and preparation of papers for scientific journals and for a WG-EMM workshop meeting in July 2007 and;
(3)	to prepare for the 2007-08 field season, including handling all ordering of supplies and the SIP and Polar Ice reports.


  Tasks

1.  Seabird Research at Admiralty Bay: The Contractor will direct the collection of             penguin reproductive, growth, abundance and distribution, and survival data.  Specifically, she will establish the reproductive studies at the beginning of the season, train the other field biologists in the study methods, and will oversee all aspects of the study during the field season.

2. Post-season Data Analysis: The Contractor will analyze data on penguin reproductive
success, abundance and distribution, survival and foraging behavior collected at the Copa field site in the 2006/07 year and submit these data to the CCAMLR database in summary form.
 
3. Meetings:  The contractor shall participate in the EMM workshop in July 2007,
lending her expertise of the Copa database to modeling efforts of predators at the meeting.

4. Pre season Logistics: The Contractor, based upon her prior experience at this remote field site, will oversee the procurement of the materials, equipment, and supplies needed to run the camp for the 2007-08 field season.  

These tasks can only be accomplished with prior , first hand knowledge of the research site, Susan Trivelpiece has directed the predator studies at the site since its inception in 1976 therefore is uniquely qualified to complete the tasks specified by this contract. Questions concerning proposed contract may be submitted to Melvin N. Fondue. This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000

GITM would also like the vendor to provide an estimated time of response and plan for escalation to the next level. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Cisco switches.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.  The Cisco Switches and Components have been identified as a key component of the Department of State infrastructure.  Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department nor been proven in field use may result in equipment conflicts, increase the complexity of integration, and may not be compatible with the Department of State network requirements. To ensure compatibility with existing network components in the field, the switches must be a Cisco model and provided by a Cisco reseller.  IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the Cisco equipment listed in paragraph two (2) as a key component of the Department’s networking system. Equipment listed above is required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of State’s enterprise network infrastructure based on existing management tools and routing capabilities that requires two critical protocols supported only by Cisco network switches; HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol).  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The Cisco switches (part numbers and descriptions listed in paragraph 2) have undergone test and assessment, evaluation for GITM deployments and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name basis is for the use of the APC Smart-UPS (part number and descriptions listed in paragraph 2).  The use of an APC Smart-UPS is essential to the Government’s requirement for server and network infrastructure power protection thereby precluding consideration of the products of another brand at this time.  The APC Smart-UPS has been identified as a key component of the Department’s server and network infrastructure power protection system.  APC Smart-UPS is an IRM ITCCB approved hardware and used to provide power protection for several years.  Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department for compatibility with existing hardware and software at this time will cause unacceptable delays to the Program in support of the unclassified and classified IT refresh.   To ensure compatibility with existing hardware and software in the field, the uninterrupted power supply must be an APC Smart-UPS unit and provided by an APC reseller.  IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the APC Smart-UPS rack mount server and network infrastructure uninterrupted power supply (part numbers and descriptions listed in paragraph 2) as a key component of the Department’s server and network infrastructure power protection system.  APC Smart-UPS power protection system works with existing hardware and software fielded in the unclassified and classified network to protect critical servers and data network infrastructure.

<DESC>Purchase of an Integrated Image Quality Analysis System
//Description//The Library of Congress intends to purchase through sole source from ImageXpert, 486 Amherst Street, Nashua, NH 03063-1224, an ImageXpert 25" x 25" travel manual XY motion control integrated image quality analysis system for the measurement and characterization of printed images and text.  This system will be used for the quality control evaluation of printed documents and labels, and for research on image permanence and image degradation factors.    It is the Library's understanding that the identified system is the only one commercially available in the U.S. that is capable of meeting the Library’s critical performance requirement for an integrated image quality analysis system that also meets the following needs:  The system must be able to measure and characterize image quality on images and text produced by a variety of methods, including but not limited to: writing and printer's ink, toner, ink-jet, laser, thermal transfer, and direct thermal; the system must employ a non-contact measurement technique via an integrated fire wire 3 CCD 1024 x 768 color camera with full resolution of images of each color plane, a high frequency light source, lens, and power supply; the camera must have variable shutter control to minimize the exposure of the sample to light, and to enable the analysis of darker images; the system must include a NIST traceable calibration target for the camera; the system must include a 25" x 25" travel manual XY motion table with stand; the system must include a library of pre-defined quantitative image analysis algorithms that quantify the following characteristics:  line quality, dot quality, uniformity, text quality, inter-color bleed, dot position, satellites, mottle, graininess, ghosting or residual images, banding and streaking, edge raggedness, feathering and wicking, half-tone quality, character integrity, color registration, toner scatter, and dimensional accuracy; the system must be able to be run in a completely interactive mode for single sample analysis, or automated mode for measurement of multiple samples, or the same sample over time; the system must be able to be upgraded to integrate and control the following additional accessories: interactive and automated 2400 dpi true optical resolution transmission/reflection flatbed scanner, full-motion automated X-Y table with Heidenheim encoder, laser triangulation system for height and depth profiling down to 1 µm, gloss-meter, and spectrodensitometer; the system must include 1-D FFT for periodic banding analysis; the system must include dynamic threshold adjustment to accommodate for changes in lighting or sample brightness; the system must include dynamic location and dynamic image offset to accommodate for changes in sample or image placement to ensure accurate sample placement and measurement repeatability; the system must include time-lapse measurement capabilities to assess samples over time; the system must report data as tab-delimited text files for maximal portability.  Any other company that, at the time of application, (1) is either legally incorporated as a U.S. business entity or capable of demonstrating through its business plan its intention to be fully incorporated as a U.S. business, and (2) believes that it can provide all of the parts and accessories listed above and can meet all the above performance requirements can apply to the Library for consideration.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures pursuant to the authority of FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (10 U.S.C. 2304(g) and 2305 and 41 U.S.C. 253(g) and 253a and 253b), and FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items (Title VIII of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-355)). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; therefore, a written solicitation will not be issued. The Billings Area Indian Health Service (IHS) intends to award a firm fixed-price commercial item contract in response to Request for Quotation (RFQ) 10-06-045-REL. This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-11. The associated North American Industry Classification System code is 518210 and the small business size standard is $23.0 million. PRICE SCHEDULE–CONTRACT LINE ITEM NUMBER (CLIN) ONE: BASE PERIOD: 12,000 claims @ $________ each = $__________; OPTION YEAR ONE: 36,000 claims @ $________ = each $________; CLIN TWO: OPTION YEAR TWO: 36,000 claims @ $________ each = $________. GRAND TOTAL - $__________. Potential contractors shall submit an offer for all CLINs. PURPOSE OF THE CONTRACT: The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire contract electronic claims processing services for the Crow Service Unit, PHS Indian Hospital, Crow Agency, Montana. STATEMENT OF WORK: (a) The contractor must provide electronic and/or paper claim submissions to third party insurance companies for the Crow/Northern Cheyenne Service Unit Business Office. (b) The contractor must provide a Transmission Receipt report on the same day each transmission is received. The Transmission Receipt report must either be faxed or emailed to the Business Office Manager and Lead Billing Technician. This report must include the total number of claims received and the total number of claims with errors. (c) All claims successfully transmitted to the clearinghouse/contractor must be processed within 2 days of receipt. (d) The contractor is only allowed to bill for the claims that are successfully transmitted without errors. The contractor is not allowed to bill above and beyond that service provided. The contractor cannot bill for any claims with errors. (e) The contractor will bill monthly. A copy of the invoice is to be faxed to the Business Office Manager. The Business Office will verify the billing according to the Business Office Transmission Log. Discrepancies will be handled between the Business Office Manager and the Contractor before approval will be made for payment. (f) Any problems identified by the contractor must be brought to the immediate attention of the Project Officer, Lead Billing Technician and/or Business Office Manager. (g) The contractor must have a toll free telephone number available during normal business hours. (h) The contractor will mail all paper claims by regular mail. (i) There are no equipment requirements as the Indian Health Service already possesses a modem and Pro Con Plus, which is a program used to transmit third party claims. (j) There are no computer security requirements due to the fact that the contractor will not be logging into our system for any reason. The Indian Health Service will transmit the information. (k) The Privacy Act of 1974 does apply. The Privacy Act mandates that the Contractor maintain complete confidentiality of all administrative, medical and personnel records, and all other pertinent information that comes to his/her attention or knowledge. The Privacy Act carries both civil and criminal penalties for unlawful disclosure of records. Violation of such confidentiality shall be cause for adverse action. (l)Quarterly audits will be done by the Service Unit Billing Staff. Each staff member will randomly pick 10 claims and follow its progress to verify that the insurance company has received the claim. If for some reason claims for a particular date of transmission come up mission, a more intense audit will be done on that specific transmission date. The contractor will then need to resubmit those claims at its expense. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Date of Award through September 30, 2006, with two 12-month options. CONTRACTING OFFICER AUTHORITY: Authority to negotiate changes in the terms, conditions or amounts cited in this contract is reserved for the Contracting Officer. PROJECT OFFICER: The project officer shall be responsible for: (1) Monitoring the Contractors technical progress, including surveillance and assessment of performance and recommending technical changes; (2) Interpreting the Statement of Work; (3) Technical evaluation as required; (4) Technical inspections and acceptance; and (5) Assisting the Contractor in the resolution of technical problems encountered during performance of this contract.

1.	Introduction

Food and Nutrition Information Center (FNIC), National Agricultural Library (NAL) and the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) plan to develop an Infant Feeding interactive on-line lesson consisting of  three on-line modules.  This new lesson will be a new addition to the 4 lessons that currently make up WIC Learning Online. FNIC is a national center that provides information, and offers training and education opportunities using appropriate technology.  

2.  Scope and Objective

Scope includes development, design, and implementation of one interactive on-line training lesson consisting of three modules with additional references, job aids, and glossary sections for WIC staff.  

This on-line training is intended to provide WIC personnel approximately 1 hour of time-efficient training and tools to help  provide nutrition education to WIC participants.  The module should use multimedia, contain case studies that call for the trainee to take action from a menu of choices and provide feedback on the choices made.  Quizzes and tests or other assessment methodologies should be included.  
  
The design should permit a bookmark feature and an internal search feature. It also should provide flexibility in graphic design selection, background, toolbars, etc. The on-line module  must be deployed on the Learning Management System (LMS) at Skillsoft (www.skillsoft.com).

New module topics are provided below. See Web site (http://www.nal.usda.gov/wicworks/WIC_Learning_Online/index.html) for the current modules.

„X	Chapter 1  ¡V	Infant Feeding 0-6 months

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. A more detailed solicitation is available on Federal Technical Data Solutions (FEDTEDS) Web Page at http://www.fedteds.gov/. Solicitation Number W912HZ-06-T-0036 is being issued as a request for quotation (RFQ) with the intent to award as a simplified acquisition.  The solicitation document and incorporated provision and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-11.  THIS PROCUREMENT IS 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE AND ISSUED UNDER NAICS CODE 334511 (SIC 3679) WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 750 EMPLOYEES FOR A FIRM FIXED PRICE CONTRACT.  This proc urement may be quoted as follows: Line Item 0001 Supplies/Services: Furnish and Deliver a Large-Scale Transport Facility (LSTF) Beach Profiling Instrument in accordance with attached scope of work Quantity: 1, Unit: Lump Sum, Unit Price $ ___________; Tota l amount for Line Item 0001 $____________.  Award shall be made to the responsive and responsible offeror whose quote is determined to be the lowest price.  The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) has a requiremen t for a Large-scale Sediment Transport Facility (LSTF) Beach Profiling Instrument.  The LSTF is a 30 m by 50 m by 1.4 m basin that was constructed to reproduce surf zone processes found on long beaches at a relatively large scale. Research being conducted in the LSTF is leading to improved methods for estimating surf zone sediment transport. The facility contains wave generators, a recirculation system, a sand beach, an automated instrumentation bridge, and a suite of instruments to measure wave heights, cu rrents, and transported sediment. The LSTF sand beach is approximately 18 m wide by 30 m long, with depths up to 1.0 m. One of the essential requirements of all experiments in the facility is the ability to rapidly survey the beach to quantify local depths , beach profile evolution, ripple formation, and changes in bathymetry due to structures. Draining and filling of water into a facility the size of the LSTF requires two days and can destroy beach features. Therefore, it is necessary to survey the beach wi th water in the LSTF. The instrumentation bridge includes a motorized carriage that traverses in the cross-shore direction, which is available to mount a survey instrument weighing less than 10 lbs. The cross-shore carriage operates at 10 cm/s and the requ ired cross-shore resolution of depth measurements is 0.5 cm. The bridge traverses in the longshore direction and is stationary while the cross-shore motor is operating. Longshore resolution of beach profiles varies depending on research being performed.  T he finest resolution that has been required to date is 25 cm, but future research needs may justify finer resolution. To reduce the number of cross-shore passes of the profiler to meet the longshore resolution requirements, the instrument should be capable  of obtaining depths over a total longshore length of 25 cm in a single pass. Within the 25 cm swath, at least eight, equally-spaced sensors are required.  Additionally, a variable spacing of sensors may be required in some research applications. The instr ument should have the provision to adjust the spacing of at least 4 sensors over a 25 cm longshore swath for meeting specific research needs. If necessary, the variable-spaced sensors may be provided as a separate attachment to the instrument.  The instrum ent would be required to operate in an extreme environment. The LSTF is located in a shelter and, while protected against rain, it is subjected to heat, cold and humidity. The instrument must be able to operate in ambient temperatures ranging from 20 deg F  to in excess of 100 deg F, and humidity greater than 90 percent. Lastly, the servomotors that operate the wave generators, bridge and cross-shore motor generat e electronic noise. The instrument should have the capability to operate with DC power or otherwise immune to electronic noise associated with existing equipment.  The beach profiler provided by the vendor should meet the following requirements: a.	Capability of obtaining measurements underwater at depths between 5 cm and 100 cm with accuracy within 0.2 cm. b.	An instrument capable of sampling at 20 Hz to meet the cross-shore resolution of 0.5 cm. c.	The ability to capture depths spaced 25 cm apart in a single swath and the ability to collect measurements within the 25 cm swath.  Additionally, at least 4 sensors with adjustable spacing are required to meet specific research needs.  d.	The survey instrument should not involve direct contact with the bottom to avoid altering ripples or bed forms. e.	Output in ASCII format with RS232 connection. f.	Capability to operate on DC power or otherwise immune to electronic noise associated with existing equipment. g.	Weight less than 10 lbs. h.	Ability to operate and provide accurate measurements in ambient temperatures ranging from 20 deg F to in excess of 100 deg F, and humidity greater than 90 percent.  i.	Delivery of the product that meets all requirements within 60 days of awarding of contract. Following delivery, acceptance testing will be performed and compared to rod surveys of the LSTF beach. These specifications are available at Federal Technical Data Solutions (FEDTEDS) Web Page at http://www.fedteds.gov/ or https://www.fedteds.gov/fedteds/start.nsf/frm.VendorLogin?OpenForm&SolicitationNumber=W912HZ-06-T-0036.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis / solicitation for services being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures. The office of NOAA, Cordell Bank, National Marine Sanctuary located in Olema, CA intends to acquire the following services:

Statement of need:

We are proposing to survey Cordell Bank to document and characterize the presence of derelict fishing gear on the bank and conduct a feasibility assessment by conducting pilot field removal of derelict fishing gear to refine our methodologies and assess cost and benefit of at least 2 different types of gear removal in CBNMS.

Background: 

We have documented significant amounts of derelict fishing gear in Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary. This includes long lines, gill nets, crab gear, and trawl warps entangled on the bank. Our concern is that this abandoned gear may be negatively impacting Sanctuary resources, creating artificial habitat for marine life. 

Since 2000, we have conducted biological assessment surveys on pre-determined transect lines in Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary using the a manned submersible.  Transects were initially established to sample a variety of habitats with no realization that derelict fishing gear was so prominent on the bank.  Since transects are fixed, we have had no opportunity to survey other areas of the bank and document the full impacts from this abandoned gear. During biological surveys, we have encountered a significant amount of gear, mostly long line gear that has snagged on the bank, and some of which flags into the water column.  In 2002 alone, in surveys conducted on cobble, rock, boulder and high-relief rocky habitat on Cordell Bank, gear was observed on 90% of the transects, with an average density of one piece of gear observed every 670 linear meters. 

Scope of work: 

The objective of the sanctuary is to assess the feasibility of at least 2 alternate gear removal methods.  We would like to conduct 5 days of reconnaissance and test removal operations in CBNMS utilizing at least two methods of removal including diver, remotely operated vehicle and or submersible.  A field report and cost/benefit analysis will be written up by the Wildlife care network for each method tested.  Gear removal work will need to be documented with a broadcast quality camera and adequately illuminated with HMI lights to ensure that damage to the bank is kept to a minimum.  We would also like to document the gear removal with digital still photos for our image library and outreach purposes.  Image size should be at least 5 mega pixels.  

The success of the operation will not hinge upon the amount of debris removed but on the ability of the contractor to test the effectiveness of various methods of gear removal; in different habitat types, depth ranges and on different fishing gear types. 

The habitat of Cordell Bank is varied from mud, coble, sand, boulder and very high relief rock making operations of any nature complicated. Video of the Bank can be seen online at the following link: http://cordellbank.noaa.gov/education/videogallery.html 


Project Timeline

October 15 – October 31st, 2006

Selection:

The selection of a contractor for this contract will be on the basis of price and technical ability.  Technical ability includes evaluation of past performances with Government contracts and ability to meet the needs of Sanctuary research.  The technical evaluation and price evaluation are equal in importance. 

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. All interested parties must respond to this announcement within (15) calendar days of ite publication. All responses must be in writing and may be faxed to (206)-527-7166 attention Melvin Fondue.

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION: The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, Executive Office (PRM/EX).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Network Appliance Netapp Filer FAS250.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) and Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.  PRM/EX is currently using a Network Appliance Netapp Filer F760 on its classified network and plans to upgrade its current model to the FAS250 which incorporates disaster recovery features such as bare-metal restore, image snapshots, and data replication capabilities fully compatible with and supported by the technology and infrastructure currently being used by the State Department to provide secure off-site storage and disaster recovery.  To provide the same level of continuity, disaster recovery capability, and compatibility, PRM/EX plans to procure a second Network Appliance Netapp Filer FAS250 for its unclassified network.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the bureau’s requirements as a key component of its Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) and Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP).Netapp Filers have received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.

FOB DESTINATION CONUS BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION: As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements. The Dell PowerEdge 1855 blade server was selected for this purpose because it must be used in a standardized Dell environment and because results obtained by the Bureau’s Systems Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturer’s servers indicated that it most closely met the Department of State’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements. The PowerEdge 1855 has been approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and is being added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which, in the interests of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration, has established an environment comprised solely of Dell HW.  The continued use of Dell servers obviates the need to procure, maintain and account for spare parts inventories for multiple HW manufacturer’s server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ out years support and maintenance agreements.    The PowerEdge 1855 blade servers offer space utilization and cost advantages over the 1 U servers they replace.  They will be deployed at a facility that is space constrained and thus the ability to deploy 10 blade servers in a chassis occupying only 7U of rack space is of special significance.   Unlike some other manufacturers’ blade servers, the 1855s offer the same functionality as can be obtained from 1 U servers, i.e., there is no trade-off between density and functionality. The Dell PowerEdge 1855 servers are to replace older equipment and must be delivered, installed, configured, tested and integrated in the production environment in time to go live prior to October 4, 2006, the initiation date of the 2008 Diversity Visa program. CA/CST therefore must take physical possession of this HW no later than September 1, 2006.   Even if another manufacturer’s server identical to the PowerEdge 1855 in terms of specifications, configuration and functionality were to become available at this juncture, it could not be evaluated and baselined in time to ensure that it would be requisitioned, competed, obtained, and otherwise readied for use by October 4, 2006.   Absolutely no slippage can be allowed in the initiation date of the 2008 Diverstiy Visa program that the PowerEdge 1855 will support.

Currently telephony support is provided by the Air Force Research Lab, Rome Research Site (Rome Labs). The Rome Labs Director has determined that they no longer desire to support DFAS Rome.  This means that DFAS Rome requires its own PBX for telephony support. 
 
2.0 SCOPE:  The Nortel PBX at DFAS Rome requires an upgrade in order to meet Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) requirements.  DFAS Rome currently has a population of 564 personnel.

The contractor will provide equipment, software, and such technical support and training needed to install and implement the upgrade of the Nortel PBX to version 4.5 with Call Pilot, Symposium Express, and IP trunking capability.  The contractor will upgrade the frame relay room to required specifications needed to support the total population of DFAS Rome.  DFAS will provide some parts to offset costs.  These parts will be provided from the San Bernardino DFAS site.  The list of San Bernardino equipment is attached.  All equipment and installation shall meet applicable local codes for electrical and personnel safety ratings. All equipment must meet JTIC certifications. The contractor shall provide the necessary interfaces (cabling and wiring) for the PBX.

<DESC>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Please note that the camera will be used for a variety of applications, including ballistic testing and high speed compression testing.  The answers to the questions will be very different for the different applications.

QUESTION 1. What velocity range are the projectile traveling at?
ANSWER 1. For ballistic applications the projectiles will typically be in the range of 250 m/s to 1000 m/s.  For high speed compression testing applications the specimen is (nominally) static, but the loading platen will typically be moving at rates in the low end of the ballistic velocity range.

QUESTION 2.  What Caliber are the projectiles?
ANSWER 2. For ballistic applications sizes will range from .22 caliber to 12 gauge.  For high speed compression testing applications the specimens may be significantly smaller, but occasionally somewhat larger.  For this reason the camera is required to accept Nikon F mount lenses (See "Lens mounting" under "MINIMUM  REQUIREMENTS FOR CLIN 0001" in the solicitation), which will allow us to change lenses as the application demands.

QUESTION 3.  What is the field of view of the area of interest at Impact?
ANSWER 3.  For ballistic testing the field of view will vary greatly depending on whether we are interested in the response of the projectile or the response of the target.  For high speed compression testing applications the field of view will range from the size of the test specimen to a only small area of interest on the specimen.  Overall, the FOV may be as small as 5 mm by 10 mm or as large as 2 m by 1 m.  Again, the requirement of a Nikon F mount is intended to allow for different lenses to be used depending on the test requirements.

QUESTION 4.  Are the projectiles in free space or in a Chamber of some type?
ANSWER 4.  For ballistic testing the projectiles will be in free space.  For high speed compression testing applications the specimens will be fixed in the test apparatus.

<DESC>The closing date for receipt of proposals is extended to 4:00PM EDT on Wednesday, August 16, 2006.

Questions received in response to this combined synopsis/solicitation will be posted to this website the week of July 31, 2006.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a request for quote, solicitation number SP3100-6191-9502.  This requirement is set aside for small business; the associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 334310 with a small business size standard of 750 employees.
The Defense Distribution Center located in New Cumberland, PA has a requirement for a contractor to furnish and install an Audio/Visual Presentation System in the Command Control Center (CCC) Conference Room located in Building 81.  
Offerors shall provide a firm fixed price for the contract line items as follows: clin 0001, Equipment -- Offerors shall provide the unit price for each component and the total amount, inclusive of shipping costs (FOB Destination, New Cumberland, PA); clin 0002, Installation of equipment; clin 0003, one year warranty and preventative maintenance; clin 0004 (optional), second year preventative maintenance.  Note: Desired schedule for delivery and installation is 3 weeks ARO; Required schedule for delivery and installation is 4 weeks ARO.

The Scope of Work for this requirement is as follows:
The CCC conference room is approximately 28-feet long by 20-feet wide and is a SECURE ROOM (controlled access).  A 4-foot X 10-foot conference table and 10 chairs are positioned in the center of the room.  Current equipment in the room includes a white board, with three separate sliding panels, comprising most of one wall; six computer desktop workstations located along two adjacent walls; a SECURE (SIPR) and NON-SECURE (NIPR) communications (email) network system, linking the 6 computer workstations previously identified to their respective (SIPR/NIPR) Local Area Networks (LAN); a wall-mounted 19-inch television (which will need to be removed by the Contractor before installation of the new AV equipment) connected to a Cable TV network and a ceiling-mounted visual projector that faces a retractable projection screen along the same wall as the sliding dry-erase white boards noted above.  Ideally, amongst other functionality, the added audio/video display capability being requested in this SOW will supersede (replace) the need to utilize the current video projection and supporting retractable screen currently being employed in the CCC.  There are numerous power outlets throughout the space. The conference room has a standard 8-foot drop ceiling.  A schematic of the space is available from the Contract Specialist POC.
Government responsibilities:
1. Provide access to necessary areas to complete the project during normal business hours (0800 – 1700 M-F)
2. Provide a safe and clean environment for contractor employees and their subcontractors.
3. Provide computer network system, both SECURE and NON-SECURE, to have video display equipment interfaced to.
4. Provide cable TV network to have video display equipment interfaced to.
5. Provide 110V power supply for the following equipment being installed by the contractor

Contractor responsibilities:
The contractor shall provide the capability for the Command Control Center (CCC) to visually display on three separate contractor-provided and installed 60-inch (or larger) plasma monitors, information and or video from existing computer network systems, SECURE (SIPR) and NON-SECURE (NIPR) systems and from an existing cable TV network.  Capability to display this information by these three plasma monitors must also include the ability to display multiple-source data into one plasma monitor simultaneously (minimum of two and maximum of four (quad) displays per monitor) and the ability to switch sources feeding these the monitors instantaneously.  It is anticipated that two of these plasma monitors would be located along the wall where the current retractable projection screen is located and the third screen would be located along a different wall within the same space. Each monitor must also have audio capability (integrated or as a separate speaker system)
The contractor shall also provide the CCC capability to add up to six additional computer workstations at the CCC Conference table, by providing the necessary computer network (both NIPR and SIPR) interface connections, to allow for a “plug and play” type capability and for these added workstations to also be able to feed information and have it displayed to the three plasma monitors, with the same level of functionality as previously described for the already existing computer network workstations. The overarching concept is that a laptop could be placed onto the conference room table and quickly and easily be “plugged” into the existing LANs, and removed just as effortlessly.  
The contractor will provide two audio/visual control systems.  One will be a movable desktop control panel, with the intention of it being used at the conference table, when needed. The second control system will be integrated with a portable podium. The podium should be easily movable (wheels or extremely light weight and be of standard size and configuration. Both systems should be capable of operating independently or in tandem (simultaneously).   
Specific audio/video equipment recommended to be provided and installed by the contractor to achieve the required added functionality includes, but is not limited to, the following:
1. Three 60 inch plasma data display screens (or larger), with a minimum 1024x768 resolution, with depth dimension not to exceed 6 inches, capable of being wall-mounted or ceiling-mounted. Each monitor must also include audio output capability. 
2. Combination S-VHS Hi-Fi VCR/DVD player. Only special requirement for this equipment is that it can be stored properly in equipment rack also to be provided by the contractor.
3. Two portable video control panels.  One suitable for desktop mounting, the other to be part of a portable podium system. 
4. Portable podium with attached/installed video control panel.  Due to size of CCC Conference room, there is no need for a microphone with this podium.  The podium should be easily movable, either on wheels or extremely light weight and be of standard size and configuration 
5. Equipment rack (if required), to house VCR/DVD player, switcher, and any other associated equipment. 
6. Required interfaces, control system, remotes, power switches, switch boxes, cables, connectors and other mounting brackets to install all items identified above.
7. Required interfaces and hardware to support capability of integrating additional six computer workstations on the conference room table, when needed (plug and play) to the existing computer network (NIPR and SIPR).
8. One year warranty and preventive maintenance on entire audio visual system installed by the contractor.
9. Second year preventative maintenance. 
Contractor shall install the audio visual system.  Contractor shall ensure full integration with VTC equipment.  Contractor shall test and align the system.  Labor and programming will include all on-site installation and wiring, coordination and supervision, testing, checkout and training.  Also includes all fabrication, modification, assembly, rack wiring and programming.  All items that are mounted must be able to be remounted if equipment must be relocated in the future to another room.
A site visit will be conducted on Monday, July 17, 2006 at 01:00 PM EDT (1300 EDT).  Contractors interested in attending must provide the following information to the Contract Specialist POC no later than 12:00 PM EDT (1200 EDT) on Thursday, July 13, 2006:
	- Company Name
	- Employee Name
	- Employee Social Security Number
	- Employee Date of Birth
	- Employee State and Country of Birth
Please note that cameras and cell phones with cameras will not be permitted during the site visit.  Contractors shall not attempt to bring photographic equipment onto the Defense Distribution Center.
