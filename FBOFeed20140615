<CONTACT>William T. Brannen, Phone 7704882084, Email vwl0@cdc.gov - Lawrence  R. McCoy, Contracting Officer, Phone 770-488-2087, Fax 770-488-2670, Email GWG8@cdc.gov
<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and prevention intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to Beyond 20/20 for the acquisition of software licenses and related support services, technical assistance, and maintenance of the Web Data Server and Professional Builder software from Beyond 20/20, Inc. The dynamic interactivity allowed by the Beyond 20/20 has not been matched by other potential vendors. The project officer regularly monitors and evaluates of other Federal program solutions, including those of the Department of Education's National Center for Educational Statistics, the Nation Institutes of Health's National Cancer Institute's Cancer Control PLANET, and Data Ferret and other solutions provided through the Census Bureau. And the project officer regularly reviews vendor materials available through the GSA IT Schedule 70 website. In the course of these reviews and explorations, it is apparent that no other vendor provides a software solution with the manner of interactivity available to the end user as the Beyond 20/20 Web Data Server. The government's requirement is for software, services, and web hosting allowing fast and reliable production of public use population health statistics in hyper-dimensional data cubes that can be accessed through a dynamically interactive web interface featuring click-and-drag technology. Customizable data tables shall result, conforming to individual end users' specifications, and able to be displayed as a data table, various chart types, and mapped when geographic data are available. The government also requires that data tables produced from these data cubes be easily accessible to the general public. End users shall have available downloadable versions of the data cubes and associated software for interactive table production and manipulation offline.</p>
<p>Other contractors and other Federal solutions to providing access to public use data were evaluated, as described above. None of the solutions offered the kind of dynamic interactivity present in the Beyond 20/20, Inc. Web Data Server software and associated data production, and maintenance software, and support services.</p>
<p>Since about 2002 the National Center for Health Statistics has used the Beyond 20/20, Inc. software solution and services. After successfully completing the original requirement to deliver and customize a COTS system for interactive data dissemination, the requirement has become one of support for ongoing data dissemination. Currently, two independent websites, Health Data Interactive and VitalStats, rely on Beyond 20/20, Inc. software and services. Replacing this solution would require a prohibitively high expenditure for design and development costs of a new system and associated web pages, as well as costs to train staff and reconfigure data preparation procedures for a new solution.</p>
<p>If the incumbent is not selected, another vendor would either propose to recreate our current system with their own inadequate software solution, or they would have to license Beyond 20/20's software. In the former case, the investment needed to build or repurpose other software would require time and government staff resources to guide the development of a new system which are no available. In the latter case, the time required to license, learn, and install the Beyond 20/20 software would most likely make the systems inaccessible to the public for some period of time during a transition. The difficulties posed by these scenarios are especially likely if the solicitation was to be restricted to small businesses with their limited resources.</p>
<p>In terms of service and maintenance of the Beyond 20/20, Inc. software, one alternative is having a third party vendor acquire the knowledge and skills independent of Beyond 20/20, Inc., to service the latter's products. The anticipated delay and reliability of receiving these services would be lengthy and unacceptable. A second alternative for maintenance would be to have a third party vendor license the software from Beyond 20/20, Inc., and in the process become trained by the latter in servicing the software. Again, the amount of time needed to acquire the skills necessary would delay the delivery of these services to the government. When there is a maintenance issues with such resources, timely response is critical to retaining the user base.<br /><br />This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within fifteen (15) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any quotation/response should be emailed to William Brannen at vwl0@cdc.gov by 5:00 P.M. June 30th, 2014.</p>

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>
<p>(1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>
<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>

<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>

<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>
<p>(2) A statement that the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation; and</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)<br />The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
