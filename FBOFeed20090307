<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to cancel the Solicitation. The Requirements for this facility have changed significantly enough since the initial posting to warrant removal from public consideration until such time as the US Government feels confident the Solicitation meets the needs of both the US Government and the Afghanistan National Army. When a new Solicitation is posted an announcement will be made on the USACE,  Afghanistan  Engineer District and Federal Business Opportunities websites. The Pre-Proposal conference scheduled for 10 March 2009 is  cancelled until further notice.
