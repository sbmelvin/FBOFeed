However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

<DESC>38 CONS/LGCA intends to issue a solicitation for the installation of a new tower and relocation of equipment from an old LMR facility into building 1052 at Creech AFB NV. A complete 150-ft free standing tower has already been purchased and is onsite at Creech (disassembled). The contractor for this project will assemble and install the tower at building 1052, along with a new foundation, RF cables, antennas, antenna standoffs, lightning protection and grounding. In addition, two racks of existing LMR equipment will be relocated from an existing LMR facility (bldg 221), installed, powered, grounded, and connected to the new antennas on the above tower. The tower at Bldg 221 will also be partially disassembled by the contractor, and loaded onto a government provided truck for transport by the government to a storage location. Within building 1052, the contractor will also install a new rack adjacent to the relocated LMR racks for a new PTX-150 paging unit (already onsite). All new and relocated racks will then be connected thru a dedicated, contractor installed UPS adjacent to the new/relocated racks. All power connections and cable trays above the rack lineup will be contractor installed (see attached sketches for further details). In addition to the above, the contractor will conduct an RF path study to determine whether an existing microwave on Creech (with an 8-ft dish) can be relocated to the new tower at 1052 and operate successfully between the new tower (using a 4-ft dish) and an existing microwave tower on Angels Peak, approximately 19 miles away. The existing microwave currently bounces RF energy off of a passive reflector to bend around an existing geographical obstruction to reach Angels Peak. If the RF path study indicates the microwave path between the new tower at building 1052 and Angels Peak is viable, then the associated microwave equipment in the exterior mounted equipment cabinet will be relocated to building 1052. Relocated equipment will be mounted in the same rack as the new PTX-150 pager system. This will also require new waveguide from the contractor furnished 4-ft microwave dish, down the tower, and into the relocated microwave equipment. Once this relocation is complete, the contractor will optimize the path from the new microwave antenna at building 1052 to the distant antenna located on Angels Peak, approximately 19 miles away. This will include realigning the antenna at Angels Peak to operate with the new microwave antenna at bldg 1052<br />This proposed contract is set aside for Woman Owned Small Business concerns. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code proposed for the requirement is 237130. The size standard for NAICS 237130 is $33.5 million. <br />Award will be made using Lowest Price Technically Acceptable in accordance with FAR Par 15. A solicitation will be electronically posted on or about 8 Mar 12. All notices and any/all amendments will be posted and available for viewing on this site (www.fbo.gov). The date and time for the preproposal site visit will be included in FAR 52.236-27 located in Section 00100 for the RFP - Bidding Schedule/Instructions to Bidders. It is the responsibility of interested parties to review this site frequently for the posting of any updates/amendments to the solicitation.

By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>This is a market survey for new RF coaxial switches for the Airport Surveillance Radar 9 (ASR-9) system for the Federal Aviation Administration.  The attached draft specs / drawings documents describe the acquisition of these RF coaxial switches, NSN 5930-01-310-1707. Currently, the only known source for these switches is RLC Electronics, Inc., Mount Kisco, NY. 
The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting proposals at this time.
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing the coaxial switches for the ASR-9, per the attached draft specs / drawings and Statement of Work (SOW).

Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.
In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:

Please respond by reviewing the draft Statement of Work and submitting a filled-out and signed copy of the Declaration form (please submit electronically, email to address below).

Aircraft will be required to operate out of irregular areas and must be of a design and power to adequately perform over and from such areas. Strict compliance with aircraft specifications and use of experienced pilots shall be required.
<p>Aircraft shall be maintained and operated in accordance with this agreement, the Federal Aviation regulations (FAR), and the aviation regulations of the State of Alaska, except those requirements specifically waived by the Contracting Officer for operation under this agreement. Status as a "public aircraft" does not alter this requirement for compliance with the above regulations. All aircraft and contractors shall be capable of meeting minimum technical requirements per the solicitation, possess a FAA Part 135 Certificate, and all offered aircraft must be listed on their FAA Part 135 Operations and Specifications. Individual orders/calls against the BPA will not exceed $150K. A sampling of CWN BPAs used during FY11 revealed that approximately 99% of individual CWN BPA calls were at or less than $2,500 per order. The Government does not guarantee any minimum use or orders should a BPA be awarded.</p>
<p>Awarded BPAs will not allow for economic pricing adjustments, though contractors will be permitted to modify their submitted pricing no more frequently than monthly. These BPAs may be cancelled at any time at the written request of the Contractor or Government. The USFS asks that you submit your offers as soon as possible after the solicitation is posted as opposed to waiting until a day or two prior to the closing date. As multiple awards will be made there is no advantage to waiting.</p>
<p>It is a requirement that the successful awardees be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). This procurement is set aside for small businesses. These BPAs will be procured under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures per Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 13.</p>

<DESC>Integration of region specific MARKAL energy/environment analyses with EPAUS9r MARKAL database
The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR Part 13.106-1(b) with Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM) to provide MARKAL energy/environment analyses for the Office of Research and Development (ORD) National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL).  
EPA?s Energy and Climate Assessment Team has developed a multi-region MARKAL model representation of the U.S. energy system, EPAUS9r, in order to identify future technological scenarios that will influence future emissions.  The MARKAL model provides a unifying framework for organizing data collected and developed on various technologies across the nation, and is set up at the nine census region scale.  This effort seeks to partner ECAT with a well-developed regional MARKAL database to explore the national influence of regional outcomes from climate policy analyses and to make these analyses informative and relevant for regional and federal decision-makers.  As state and regional programs occur within the context of very different federal approaches to air quality and climate mitigation, there is a need from this type of more holistic analytical tool to help understand the interplay of various types of programs between state, regional, and federal policies.  
The goals of this effort are to: (1) harmonize an existing regional MARKAL model with the current EPAUS9r, and (2) analyze a suite of regional and state climate policy options applied to both the EPAUS9r and the regional model in order to assess both the benefits of greater technological detail within the state/region as well as the broader national impact of such policies on the rest of the U.S.  
EPA has identified Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM) as the only provider of the commercial services to meet the requirements of this procurement. Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM) is the only known source able to satisfy the Governments requirement because they are the only modeling group with a fully developed, including all sectors, regional database with the capability of being integrated with the nine region U.S. database.  
This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 12 Commercial Procedures and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Sources wishing to be considered MUST submit documentation to the office identified above. Documentation must be submitted within 15 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice. Submit your request in writing to Nicole Modafari at Modafari.Nicole@epa.gov. Telephone requests will not be honored.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with Duke University School of Medicine, P.O. Box 104025, Durham, NC 27710 for database analyses. The data that will be analyzed stems from research subjects who are undergoing cardiac catheterization. The database to be analyzed is a resource of the CATHGEN research project which has consented research subjects undergoing cardiac catheterization at Duke University Medical Center since 2000. Duke University School of medicine has unique access to this database. Therefore, EPA believes this is the only vendor capable of conducting this study. The circumstance permitting is FAR 6.302-1 ?Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements?.  The anticipated period of performance is a 12 month base period with an option for an additional 12 months. All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explai n their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement and provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible. The intent of this notice is to determine if any other sources(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Consequently, anyone failing to provide the aforementioned and instead chooses to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the statement of work or more information about the project will be ignored. The information received to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Please submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Jeffery Clodfelter (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. No telephone or faxed requests will be honored.

<CONTACT>Jarrett Morrell, Senior Associate, Phone 703-749-6137, Email jarrett.morrell@cbre.com
<DESC><p>The United States General Services Administration Seeks Expressions of Interest for Lease of Office and Related Space in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT: The United States Government seeks to lease office and related space consisting of approximately 29,391 BOMA rentable square feet (BRSF), yielding approximately 26,110 ANSI/BOMA office area square feet (ABOASF), including one (1) structured parking space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>LOCATION: The delineated area is bound by K Street, NW to the north; D Street, NW to the South; 6th Street, NW to the East; and 13th Street to the West.</p>
<p>LEASE TERM: The proposed lease is for ten (10) years firm, with a right to cancel after five (5) years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>OCCUPANCY: Space must be available for occupancy by July 1, 2011.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Buildings offered for consideration must be of sound and substantial construction of the type generally recognized as contemporary with the ability to meet all current applicable federal, state, and local government building codes and regulations including, but not limited to, fire and life safety, accessibility, OSHA, and seismic protection.</p>
<p>Owners, brokers or agents may offer space for consideration.&nbsp; Any properties submitted by brokers or agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized by the ownership to exclusively represent the building offered.</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) is using a tenant broker to represent the Government in this transaction.&nbsp; In no event shall a potential Offeror enter into negotiations or discussions concerning a space to be leased with representatives of any federal agency other than the authorized offices and employees of the GSA or their authorized representative, CB Richard Ellis, Inc.</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.&nbsp; The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.&nbsp; In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Expressions of Interest shall be submitted to the Government's Broker Representative at the following address:</p>
<p>Jarrett Morrell<br />CB Richard Ellis, Inc.<br />8270 Greensboro Drive, Suite 620<br />McLean, VA&nbsp; 22102<br />Jarrett.morrell@cbre.com<br />Telephone: 703-749-6137</p>
<p>A copy shall also be sent to:<br />General Services Administration<br />1099 14th Street, NW Suite 200<br />Washington, D.C.&nbsp; 20005<br />Attention: Kenneth Shulimson</p>
<p>Expressions of interest should include the following information:</p>
<p>1. Building name, address, and age;<br />2. Location of space in the building and date of availability;<br />3. ANSI/BOMA office area/usable square feet (USF);<br />4. Rentable square feet (RSF) offered and rental rate per usable square foot, full service inclusive of a Tenant Improvement Allowance of $42.08/ANSI BOMA office area SF, meeting GSA's standard building shell requirements;<br />5. Name, address, telephone number, and email address of authorized contact;<br />6. Scaled floor plans (as-built) identifying offered space.<br />7. Information on project and building ownership.</p>
<p>Expressions of Interest are due no later than 3:00 p.m. EST on August 18, 2010.&nbsp; Please reference Project Number 9DC2013.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought Amendment for Airborne Flight Test and Ground Telemetry Recorders<br />PSC: 58 - Communication, detection &amp; coherent radiation equipment
<p>NAICS: 334511 - Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing</p>
<p>This is a Sources-Sought Synopsis (SSS)</p>
<p>The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), 412 Test Engineering Group (TENG), Edwards AFB, California is looking for sources of commercial data recording system products and services to support test programs currently executing flight test or are scheduled to be undergoing flight test in the future. The Government anticipates awarding one or more Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract(s) with five (5) year duration to support Combined Test Force (CTF) programs at Edwards AFB and other Government agency requirements through Edwards AFB. The primary programs supported by the supplier's products and services will be used to support programs including but not limited to T-38, F-16, F-35, C-130, C-17, KC-10, KC-135, B-1B, B-2, B-52, UCAS and Global Hawk/UAVs.<br /><br />Attachment 1: Detailed list of legacy airborne and legacy ground recorder configurations- (See attachement1)</p>
<p><br />The supplier/contractor will be required to have demonstrated experience and expertise in supporting legacy product (referenced below), providing upgrade/enhancement, repair, maintenance, technical support and replacement for hardware, firmware/software products as necessary. The supplier will be required to have demonstrated experience and expertise in supporting new technical recording requirements including but not limited to new data types that will be defined in future publications of Range Commanders Council (RCC) Inter-Range Instrumentation Group (IRIG) 106, Chapter 10, higher data rates and greater storage capacity. The upgrades and enhancements referred to in this SSS are nominally, but are not limited to include, the added capability to support additional Chapter 10 or other specialized data types.<br />The airborne flight test, training and ground telemetry data acquisition systems are highly advanced instrumentation systems specifically designed for aerospace flight test applications. The airborne legacy and new or enhanced equipment must comply with RCC, document IRIG 106-11 and Chapter 10 and/or previous years' publications of IRIG 106 that legacy recorders were produced under. Continuation of such compliance must be ensured. All output file formats must be in accordance with IRIG-106, Chapter 10. Similarly, compatibility with past and current versions of IRIG 106, Chapter 9 Telemetry Attributes Transfer Standard (TMATS) is mandatory. The legacy equipment includes hardware, and related software/firmware products supplied by Zodiac Data Systems (formerly Heim/Enertec) model ranges including but not limited to D200f, D5000, D7000, MDR, GSSr, and GSR200f existing systems and products that are currently installed on various aircraft and in various ground station facilities. New recorder developments are not in scope for this effort; however, upgrades and modifications to existing designs are required. The Government will not supply any proprietary or intellectual property of Zodiac Data Systems. The supplier must have the capability through internal research and development to support the flight test instrumentation community legacy and new capabilities. These capabilities include but are not limited to previous Chapter 10 interfaces as well as previous versions of IRIG-106 through the current version. These capabilities also include but are not limited to new technical recording requirements for higher data rates and new data types that will be defined in future versions of Range Commanders Council (RCC) Inter-Range Instrumentation Group (IRIG) 106, Chapter 10 (e.g. Ethernet/Gigabit Ethernet, Fire-wire (IEEE-1394b), Universal Serial Bus (USB), RS-232/422, SCSI and SATA and eSATA.</p>
<p>The contractor/supplier is not required to have or maintain a secured facility. The supplier will be required to provide onsite technical support with personnel holding a DoD secret clearance.</p>
<p>a. Determination of form and fit direct replacement capabilities will be done on either actual proposed equipment or the appropriate technical documentation that provides this information. Determination of functionality of direct replacement products will be done with contractor provided, AF approved, independent testing. The Air Force acknowledges that the IRIG 106 Chapter 10 standard does not ensure playback compatibility among different manufacturer's products. For this solicitation, proposed ground and airborne recorders that provide playback must be capable of playing back RMMs from any of the legacy airborne or ground recorders for all data types. Contractors will be required to provide independent testing of these capabilities to demonstrate compliance utilizing GFE furnished RMMs containing test files.</p>
<p>b. On a mission by mission basis, depending of test objectives Edwards test organizations employ airborne recorders that are often reconfigured (with cards/modules to record a specific suite of data type. This drives reconfiguration of the ground or airborne playback recorder to match the airborne recorder configuration. This reconfiguration is accomplished by sharing cards/modules between the airborne and ground recorders. Thus, for legacy recorders, airborne and ground/playback recorders are required to have interchangeable cards/modules within compatible models. Some airborne recorders also have playback capability that is used to support unique test missions and ground tests. Thus, the contractor must provide independent testing that validates this playback capability on these airborne recorders as well.<br />c. Previously, the words "replacement recorder" were used in the sources sought synopsis. This should have been couched as "replacement recorder/replacement parts". Acquisition of replacement recorders were driven by different causes. One cause is when a recorder or enough components are damaged beyond cost effective repair/replacement. Another cause is when new requirements exceed single recorder capacity (e.g. modules/cards for required data types and numbers of channels exceed capacity, or exceed recording capacity); in this case, designs, integration, security approvals and documentation are already available for the existing recorder .Thus the additional recorder must be able to share cards/modules across both recorders. Lastly, direct replacement parts are required to repair broken recorders.</p>
<p>d. Direct Replacement Definition. A direct replacement item must be fully form, fit and functionally identical to the item it replaces. Included herein are some salient form, fit and functional criteria examples. These are not complete listings, but are to help the reader understand that "direct replacement" and "form, fit and function" are not casual terms.</p>
<p>1. With regard to form and fit replacement recorders must fit within the existing shape of the item to be replaced. This is not just a height, length, depth three dimensional "box". Most aircraft FTI installations utilize spaces never intended to house test instrumentation. Thus direct replacements must have an almost identical shape to avoid interference with existing equipment or maintenance access/inspection, as well as mate with very specific wire/cable routing and connectors, retaining capability to isolate vibration, provide adequate cooling, enable media insertion/extraction and enable setup/troubleshooting including waste heat removal. Not only must interconnect cables be in the same location, they must also provide identical electrical/electronic function within the allowable range for the item being replaced (e.g. input impedance, short circuit protection, reverse polarity protection, current draw ,transient and quiescent, voltage operating range).</p>
<p>2. Legacy recording equipment that is maintained by this contract is installed in multiple flight test aircraft supporting a myriad of test projects/programs. These projects/programs have end-to-end secure erase procedures that have been validated through rigorous review and approval. Replacement recorders must have secure erase procedures that have no effect in these approved procedures.</p>
<p>3. For both Environmental and EMI/RFI criteria, replacement recorders must meet both the replaced equipment's specified Environmental and EMI/RFI performance, and operate within the environments and EMI/RFI constraints of all the test aircraft that currently utilize the legacy recorders.</p>
<p>4. The above clarifications of direct replacement items (both recorders and replacement parts for same) ensure that existing installation designs can be utilized without revision. Cost to scrap and rework designs would cause excessive funding requirements, extended testing requirements, and cause unacceptable program delays due to test aircraft down time and attendant schedule delay(s). Replacement Recorders/Parts must be compatible and support currently interchangeable spare parts, cards/modules and mainframes.<br />In response to this solicitation please provide the following:</p>
<p>&bull; The percentage of items that are COTS (provided to non-governmental entities) and GOTS (provided to government agencies).<br />&bull; Information to demonstrate compliance with standards referenced above.<br />&bull; Identify which applications your company will propose to support with respect to ground recording, airborne recording, data playback and/or support of the legacy equipment. <br />&bull; Include information to identify risks and proposed mitigation of these risks. Risk assessments should cover the repair, technical support, enhancement/upgrade and replacement areas solicited in this document Contractors are encouraged to submit questions and potential RISKS and mitigations associated with this acquisition related to this amendment.</p>
<p>&bull; Identify ISO 9000 and AS9100 compliance, including version.<br /><br /><br />This Sources Sought is an amended version of solicitation #: F1S0AF1125B002.</p>

<DESC>Contracting Office Address: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Material Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY 13441-4114. Point of Contact: Janis Norelli, Small Business Specialist, Phone (315) 330-3311, FAX (315) 330-2784.
<p>Capable sources are sought to perform software research, software development, deployment, familiarization, testing, installation, maintenance, and lifecycle support for the RIE Division, Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome Research Site, Rome NY (AFRL Rome).</p>
<p>HEIDI will concentrate on researching new Multi-Level Access (MLA) technologies, enhancing current solutions utilizing technologies from varying Technology Readiness Levels, and deploying and supporting these solutions to meet the current and rapidly evolving Intelligence needs of the U.S. Air Force (USAF), Department of Defense (DoD), and Intelligence Community (IC). HEIDI will result in the availability of scalable, certified MLA system to be utilized by the USAF, DoD, and IC agencies for increased security across multiple domains, accredited for operation at different classification levels within high-security environments. MLA solutions will provide authorized users the ability to securely access data from multiple security domains from a single workstation, while protecting the security domains from unauthorized access or malicious attack.</p>
<p>Over the life of the contract, effort involving the research, enhancement, and deployment within the following areas is anticipated: Secure Access Baseline for the EnterpRise (SABER) system and Joint Enterprise Department of Defense Intelligence Information Systems (DoDIIS) Infrastructure (JEDI) software.</p>
<p>As MLA and MLS (Multi-Level Security) requirements continue to evolve, the need for rapid research, enhancements, and deployment of the above mentioned and new applications will consistently be required. Cross security domain MLA solutions are critical to the Air Force Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency's (AFISRA) Combat ISR Office, the U.S. DoD, U.S. IC, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Federal Law Enforcement Agencies, and existing SABER user sites. HEIDI supports USAF efforts in providing commands with required Cross Domain C2ISR information, when and where it is needed.</p>
<p>This multi-level information access program will develop MLA capabilities, enhance the current MLAs at the Unified and Major Commands and their subordinate units, and maintain MLA at current sites. It will be necessary to provide analysis, design, software development, integration management, deployment, system and network administration/operation, technical documentation, and testing to support the maintenance and evaluation of existing systems and of new development systems. In the course of performance, this effort will require interfacing with various agencies and commands throughout the DoD through electronic means as well as technical visits at customer locations worldwide. HEIDI will also require technical support to AFRL/RIE to assist with analysis, design, development, integration, testing, and evaluation of developed solutions. Anticipated deliverables include sofrware, hardware, and technical documentation, as well as hardware suites to satisfy operational users' requirements.</p>
<p>AFRL will be conducting a Pre-Solicitation Informational Meeting for this acquisition. The purpose of this meeting is to provide interested companies with an overview of the program and an opportunity for information sharing prior to the RFP being issued. This meeting will be combined with the Pre-Solicitation Information Meeting for Research, Enhancement, and Deployment of the Enterprise Cross Domain Solution (REDE-CDS). Further information regarding this meeting will follow in a special notice.</p>
<p>An indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity, cost-plus-fixed-fee (completion) type contract is contemplated with a scoped ordering period of 60 months. Taking into consideration the real world events currently unfolding, we presently contemplate the maximum ordering amount to be approximately $45,000,000.00 for this 60-month ordering period.</p>
<p>The prime contractor and their subcontractors for this contract may require approximately forty (40) Top Secret SCI security clearances in order to support work across all areas of the program, including program management, development, enhancements, test, deployment, support, administrative, etc. Furthermore, ten (10) Top Secret SCI security clearances may be required at the onset of the contract and approximately an additional ten (10) within ninety (90) days of contract award. <br /><br />Foreign participation will be excluded at the prime contractor and subcontractor level, unless authorized through a current approved National Interest Determination (NID). The successful contractor may receive and/or generate technical data subject to export control in the performance of the contract.

<DESC>This request for information (RFI) is an update to a previously posted RFI.  The goal is to determine what advances have occurred in the past year if any. <br><br>Peptides are central to numerous research efforts at the Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) due to their extensive sequence landscape, chemical diversity and broad range of functionality.  There are currently five on-going research projects which require peptide synthesis with additional project anticipated. The Government expects this need for peptide synthesis to continue for a number of years. To date, each project has identified the need for peptide synthesis work as it occurs; and separate orders/contracts have been awarded for peptide synthesis.  With the modification to the procurement procedures, the past approach has become time consuming leading to delays which has been impeding progress to individual projects. <br><br>This Request for Information should be considered an open call for providing the government peptide synthesis needs. The Government requires two general classes of peptide synthesis: (1) linear peptide synthesis; and (2) cyclized peptide synthesis.  Additionally, the Government may require peptide arrays.  This performance-based service contract incorporates the following performance objectives:  (1) Synthesize peptides with specified sequence and purity (2) adherence to contract schedule, milestone, and delivery requirements, and (3) efficient and effective cost control.  The contractor's primary focus shall be to synthesize peptides based on the Government's specified sequence and purity.  The specific sequence, purity and quanity for each delivery order will be include on the individual delivery order.  All peptide synthesis shall include reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and Mass Spectrometry analysis.  A certificate of analysis shall be required with each shipment.  In addition, peptide arrays will require peptides to be uncoupled, in individual containers with a purification step. It is the contractor's responsibility to employ the necessary resources to ensure accomplishment of these objectives.  The government expects some face-to-face contact to ensure some specific requirement are understood and successfully accomplished, therefore we are looking for contractors who are 'local' to the NSRDEC.<br><br>This RFI is solely for information purposes and does not constitute a solicitation or the issuance thereof. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any information submitted will not be returned, and no payment will be made by the government for such information.<br><br>Point of Contact:<br>Robert Stote, 508-233-4629

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR SOLICITATION FOR PLANNING PURPOSES (OCT 1997): (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation; (b) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal; (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of conducting a market survey for an affordable FACE TM-Trademark reference COE.  <br>This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued pursuant to FAR 15.2. The U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) Redstone Arsenal, AL, on behalf of the U.S. Army, desires to obtain information on an affordable Future Airborne Capabilities Environment (FACE TM) Reference Common Operating Environment (COE) as an experimentation platform for the Army future vertical lift community.  Pursuant to FAR 15.2 this notice is being issued as a Request for Information.  In accordance with FAR 15.201 (e.), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No award is intended as a result of this RFI. The Government will not pay for information received in response to this request. <br>OVERVIEW: The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) has identified the need to develop common aircraft architecture and subsystems as a distinct, but integrated activity, emphasizing commonality, for use across the next generation fleet of joint vertical lift aircraft that is synchronized closely with the development timelines of each class of aircraft. OSD has stated that the development of the key enabling technologies and systems for a joint, common (multi-role) aircraft further substantiates the need for a developmental program of common systems and components applicable across all future aircraft types.<br>As a result of this OSD direction, the US Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) is focusing its Aviation Science & Technology (S&T) efforts towards satisfying these OSD needs. The two AMRDEC S&T programs that are applicable to this Request for Information (RFI) are: (A) Modular Integrated Survivability (MIS) and (B) Joint Common Architecture (JCA).<br>The purpose and intent of the MIS program is to design, develop, and test a Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA)-based Open Architecture that integrates aircraft survivability material solutions in a manner that results in significant reductions in overall cost, schedule, and risk.  The MIS program will specify a system architecture that incorporates an innovative integration strategy for aircraft survivability material solutions and demonstrate its value through the employment of prototype capabilities. The MIS goal is to eliminate black box stove piped solutions that are proprietary and costly to upgrade and maintain by integrating and certifying at a higher level of abstraction.<br>JCA is a part of the AMRDEC Joint Multi-Role Technology Demonstration (JMR TD) and Science and Technology Plan for the Joint Future Vertical Lift (JVFL) Initiative. The objective is to develop an optionally manned, vertical lift common Open System Architecture (OSA) derived from the Army's Aviation Capability Based Assessment (CBA). This architecture is scalable to multi-service requirements, significantly increases opportunities for innovation and competition, enables reuse of components, facilitates rapid technology insertion, and reduces maintenance and operation constraints. JCA will expand upon the software architecture, integration approach, and certification strategy developed by the MIS program.<br>FACE TM is a key component to both MIS and JCA strategic and technical objectives. The AMRDEC became a founding member of the FACE TM Consortium to address both MIS and JCA strategic and technical objectives.<br>SCOPE: AMRDEC is seeking to leverage existing, proven technology solutions from industry to develop a FACE TM reference COE. The reference COE shall consist of a computing hardware platform in addition to a FACE TM conformant software architecture. The FACE TM reference COE shall be conformant to the Technical Standard for FACE TM Reference Architecture, version 1.0 as published by the Open Group on behalf of the FACE TM Consortium. AMRDEC will use the FACE TM reference COE, as a lab-based prototype FACE TM avionics platform, to support MIS and JCA S&T system/software development, testing, and demonstrations. The AMRDEC will acquire and host 3rd party developed FACE TM-conformant reusable software components (RSC) on the FACE TM reference COE to analyze FACE TM acquisition strategies, integration approaches, and airworthiness certification implications.<br>The FACE TM reference COE should include:<br><br>I.	One (1) bus-based computing hardware platform consisting of a minimum of: (1) Two (2) fault redundant MIL-STD-1553 bus; (2) Three (3) Ethernet ports; (3) Four (4) configurable serial ports (RS-232, RS-422, RS-485); (4) One (1) card with four (4) computing processors supported by at least two (2) ARINC-653 RTOS vendors; (5) Spare card slots for additional processors; (6) One (1) 28V embedded power supply; (7) One (1) graphics card with support for FACE TM graphics services; (8) Commercial-grade hardware with equivalent military avionics grade hardware available or planned.<br><br>II.	 FACE TM conformant software implementation consisting of a minimum of: (1) ARINC-653 Operating System; (2) Two (2) different guest Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS) hosted in the ARINC-653 Operating System; (3) Board Support Packages (BSP) and FACE TM Input/Output (I/O) Services implementation suitable for exposing hardware capabilities on each RTOS; (4) Simple RTOS IPC based FACE TM Transport Services implementation; (5) Advanced middleware-based FACE TM Transport Services; (6) FACE TM Graphics Service.<br><br>RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS: Your response will not be more than twenty-five (25) typed pages, to include the Title Page. Electronic responses will be prepared using standard Microsoft Office font of Times New Roman or Ariel, with a pitch of 10 inches-12 inches, and a minimum of .5 inch margins. RFI number and Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code should be included, along with company name and point of contact information. A corporate capability brief and/or necessary drawings and diagrams may be included as an attachment and will not be counted against the response page limitation. Information provided should be limited to unclassified data. PLEASE NOTE:  NO CLASSIFIED INFORMATION IS TO BE SUBMITTED. Based on the responses received, the Government reserves the right to request further clarification or request unfunded, follow on face-to-face-briefings/presentations to enhance the Governments' understanding of the respondent's submittal. The response should contain the following information:<br><br>I. Hardware Technical Description: (1) Processor; (2) Communications; (3) Card Expansion Bus; (4) Power / Electrical; (5) Physical.<br>II.

FOREIGN PARTICIPATION IS NOT AUTHORIZED DURING THIS EFFORT; US CITIZENS ONLY.<br>After the RFI release, the following period of February 27-March 2, 2012, will be open for submittal of electronic questions, via the contracting POC, Ruth Woodham. All questions must be submitted in writing to ruth.a.woodham@us.army.mil and responses will be directed to all participants. Telephone requests for additional information will not be honored.<br> <br>The Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey.  The Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C.  1905 to protect information qualifying as "confidential" under this statute. [To avoid possible confusion with the meaning of the term "confidential" in the context of Classified Information," we will use the term "PROPRIETARY."] Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any PROPRIETARY (e.g., trade secret) restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:  (1) Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) "PROPRIETARY" with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected; (2) In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly proprietary (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "PROPRIETARY" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item (6) below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected; (3) The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain.  Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data; (4) Proprietary data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain the "PROPRIETARY" legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself.  Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends 'PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS:" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS."; (5) In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text; (6) The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain proprietary information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as "PROPRIETARY" will preclude disclosure of same outside the Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort. The Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain proprietary information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available.

II.
 Description of AT/FP Ashore systems and equipment

The AT/FP Ashore systems provide the capability to receive/transmit orders, receive and process information into situational awareness displays, support command decision processes and communicate electronic data to multi-service, multi-agency nodes across the entire all-hazards/all-threats spectrum of Ashore and Afloat operations.  AT/FP Ashore systems also provide all-hazard warnings to all personnel on board the installation, and others as appropriate. The specific types of ATFP Ashore systems are summarized as follows:  

Regional Operations Center (ROC)/ Emergency Operations Center (EOC).

The Regional Operations Center (ROC) and Emergency Operations Center (EOC) serves as the C4I point for information gathering, gain situational awareness, and exercise control over forces from early warning and detection of suspicious events through response and recovery.
 

Regional Dispatch Center (RDC)/Local Dispatch Center (LDC).

The Regional Dispatch Center (RDC) command facility is the hub for all emergency communications between Navy citizens and the First Responders in a Navy Region. The term RDC is intended to address the overarching RDC capability and all related subsystems within the RDC Family of Systems (FoS), to include, but not limited to, the Navy Emergency Response Management System (NERMS): Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD), Alarm Monitoring Automation System (AMAS), Records Management System (RMS), Mobile Data Computers (MDC), Geographic Information System (GIS), and the Emergency Call Management System (ECMS).  

Giant Voice (GV).

Giant Voice (GV) is part of the Wide Area Alert and Notification suite of systems.
 GV is comprised of an Outdoor Voice/Alert function and a System Control function. The outdoor alert function is intended to provide initial alert and follow-on directions to personnel not located in a building. The System Control function allows authorized personnel to operate the system manually or autonomously. The outdoor component consists of the outside speaker(s) positioned on pole(s) and buildings across the installation. The Giant Voice system is installed as a base-wide system to provide a siren signal and pre-recorded and live voice messages. In order to create the right level of sound output, multiple poles and speakers will be positioned across the installation.

Indoor Voice (IV).

Indoor Voice (IV) is part of the individual building Mass Notification Systems (MNS) and is comprised of Indoor Voice, Interior Notification, and System Control functions.
 The Indoor Voice (IV) function is intended to provide real-time alert and follow-on directions to personnel inside and around buildings who may or may not have direct access to a telephone or computer. The System Control function allows authorized personnel to operate the system manually or autonomously. The Interior Notification function is intended to be provided by loud speakers, warning lights, and illuminated signs or displays. Speakers are provided at all locations in and around the building at entrances/exits and other outdoor areas (such as courtyards) commonly used by the building occupants. 

Automated Telephone Notification System (ATNS).

Automated Telephone Notification System (ATNS) provides military installations with the ability to rapidly and effectively disseminate emergency alerting and notifications throughout the telephone and data network environments, including signals or messaging appropriate to force protection conditions (FPCONs), weather conditions, watches, warnings, evacuation routes, and other alerting information to meet Department of Defense (DoD) and federal warning requirements.

Computer Desktop Notification System (CDNS).

Computer Desktop Notification System (CDNS) provides Navy installations with the ability to rapidly and effectively disseminate emergency alerting and notification information throughout the data networks environment, including signals or messaging appropriate to FPCONs, information operations conditions (INFOCONs), watches, warnings, evacuation routes, and other alerting information to meet DoD and federal warning requirements.

Sensor Infrastructure, Integration, and Alarm Notification
Equipment Sensors and Alarm interfaces are part of the Navy Emergency Response Management System (NERMS)  Alarm Monitoring and Automation System (AMAS) located at a Regional Dispatch Center (RDC).
 The RDC AMAS receives signals from and continuously polls all interfaced physical security and fire alarm system equipment sensors which result in the return of alarm signals. AMAS is divided into two systems, one local and one regional (LAMAS and RAMAS). Sensors and sensor interfaces/infrastructure are installed to provide alarm notification and alarm management to all command dispatch centers. This infrastructure integrates/interfaces all existing Fire Alarm, Access Control Systems (ACS), Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), and Central Alarm Station Receiving/Monitoring Systems with LAMAS and/or RAMAS and then interfaces LAMAS with RAMAS.

Physical Security/Access Control (PS/AC).

Physical security and access control which is comprised of the following:  Automated Vehicle Gate (AVG), Automated Pedestrian Turnstile (APT), Enclaves, Electronic Security Systems, and Physical Security Information Management (PSIMS).
   PS/AC systems include: Physical Access Control System (PACS) software, either Lenel, AMAG, or another vendor's solution; License Plate Reader (LPR) systems S/W; iCX Chameleon for custom gate C2; various types of Video Management Systems (VMSs); as well as databases utilizing Oracle or MS SQL.

Responses may also be mailed to:<br />U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission<br />Division of Contracts <br />Attn: Jennifer A. DeFino; M/S: TWB-01-B10M<br />11555 Rockville Pike<br />Rockville, MD 20852</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 541690- Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services. The acquisition will be for one (1) 24-month period with three (3) 12-month options.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background<br /></span></strong>The NRC was created as an independent Agency by Congress in 1974 to enable the nation to safely use radioactive materials for beneficial civilian purposes while ensuring that people and the environment are protected. The NRC regulates commercial nuclear power plants and other uses of nuclear materials, such as in nuclear medicine, through licensing, inspection, and enforcement of its requirements. The NRC's headquarters are in Rockville, Maryland, and there are a number of other offices around the United States.</p>
<p>In accordance with the baseline inspection portion of the Reactor Oversight Process (ROP), the NRC inspects the design and operation of nuclear power reactor plants. These inspections sometimes require contractor technical support. (Note: Further information on the NRC's Reactor Inspections can be found at: <a href="http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/oversight/inspection-basics.html">http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/oversight/inspection-basics.html</a>) &nbsp;</p>
<p>Component Design Bases Inspections (CDBIs) are the primary inspection under the anticipated contract. They verify that design bases have been correctly implemented for the selected risk-significant components and that operating procedures and operator actions are consistent with design and licensing bases. This ensures that selected components are capable of performing their safety functions.</p>
<p>In addition to CDBIs, contract technical support may be required for inspections of design and operations including (but not limited to): fire protection; plant modifications; supplemental inspections at plants which experience degraded performance; reactive inspections (such as augmented inspection teams and special Inspections); independent design verification programs; and integrated design inspections.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Capability Sought<br /></span></strong>The NRC is seeking firms capable of providing technical support during the performance of baseline inspections and other inspections involving design and operation of nuclear power reactor plants. Specific activities include inspections of mechanical and electrical design information, the assessment of that information against regulatory requirements, and any associated technical reports. Services are to be provided to the NRC at nuclear power plant sites, NRC regional headquarters, and at the contractor's assigned specialists' home offices.</p>
<p>It is estimated that approximately six mechanical and six electrical engineering specialists will be needed to provide the requested services. Inspection services currently provided include approximately 20 seven-week inspections per year. These are performed under the publically available inspection procedure <a href="http://pbadupws.nrc.gov/docs/ML1008/ML100830040.pdf">http://pbadupws.nrc.gov/docs/ML1008/ML100830040.pdf</a>. Current schedules have as many as six inspections underway at one time.</p>
<p>The DRAFT Statement of Work for this effort is included as an attachment to this notice.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mandatory Qualifying Criteria<br /></span></strong>The mandatory skills required for this contract include current nuclear plant design experience, demonstrated inspection or audit skills, good communications skills and an understanding of NRC design related regulations. The design inspectors must meet the requirements for unescorted access to nuclear plants including psychological assessments and fitness for duty (including random drug testing). They will be expected to work independently during portions of the inspections. The design inspectors will be asked to certify that they meet conflict of interest requirements for the nuclear plant licensees where they perform inspections.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Market Research Questions<br /></span></strong>If your organization has the potential capacity to perform these contract services, please provide the following information:</p>
<p>1) Organization name, address, email address, website address and telephone number as well as size and type of ownership for the organization?</p>
<p>2) How long has your organization been in operation?</p>
<p>3) Any special business classifications (e.g. Small Business, Disadvantaged Business, etc)?</p>
<p>4) How many people does your organization employ, including consultants? Please break down the mix between the two categories.</p>
<p>5) Which GSA Multiple Award Schedules or Governmentwide Acquisition Contracts, if any, does your organization possess? When do they expire?</p>
<p>6) Does your organization have a Defense Contract Audit Agency (or other cognizant audit authority) approved accounting system?</p>
<p>7) Does your organization have agreed upon indirect rate agreement with any government agency?<br />8) Has your organization previously faced organizational conflict of interest issues with NRC? How were they resolved?</p>
<p>9) List any companies or government agencies your company either plans to or has performed work for related to civilian nuclear reactors. Describe the work performed.</p>
<p>10) Provide a tailored capability statement addressing the particulars of this effort, with appropriate documentation supporting claims of organizational and staff capability. Organizations responding to this market survey should keep in mind that only focused and pertinent information is requested. If significant subcontracting or teaming is anticipated in order to deliver technical capability, organizations should address the administrative and management structure of such arrangements. Taking into account the magnitude of the scope of this effort, organizations also should address the capacity of their financial infrastructure to coordinate and deliver contract performance. Although no geographic restriction is anticipated, if responding organizations are located outside the Washington Metropolitan area, indicate how the organization would coordinate with the NRC program office located in Rockville, MD to provide support to the 67 US nuclear plant sites and the four NRC regional offices.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Evaluation<br /></span></strong>The Government will evaluate market information to ascertain market capacity to:<br />1) Potentially provide the services consistent in scope and scale with those described in this notice and otherwise anticipated;<br />2) Potential capacity to secure and apply the full range of corporate financial, human capital, and technical resources required to successfully perform similar requirements; <br />3) Potential capability to implement a successful project management plan that includes: compliance with tight program schedules; cost containment; meeting and tracking performance; hiring and retention of key personnel; and risk mitigation; and <br />4) Potential to provide services under a performance based service acquisition contract.</p>
<p><br /><strong>DISCLAIMER AND NOTES:</strong> This market survey is being conducted through the FedBizOpps to reach the widest possible audience and to gather current market information. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's potential capability and capacity to perform the subject work. The Government may provide access to the information contained in the response to a contractor providing acquisition planning and strategic technical assistance support to the Government. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. After a review of the responses received, a pre-solicitation synopsis and solicitation may be published in Federal Business Opportunities. However, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to a solicitation.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ashtabula Navigation Dredging<br /></span></strong></p>
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY FOR DREDGING, ASHTABULA, OH.&nbsp; OFFER OR PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED FOR THIS NOTICE.&nbsp; THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS&nbsp;AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SOURCES SOUGHT.&nbsp; The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers - Buffalo District&nbsp; seeks information from industry, which will be used for preliminary planning purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;The type of solicitation to be issued will depend upon the responses to this synopsis.&nbsp; No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow up information requests.<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Description of Work<br /></span></strong>The purpose of the Ashtabula Harbor Navigation Dredging project planned for 2012 is to dredge and upland-place approximately 100,000 cubic yards of material from targeted areas of the Ashtabula Harbor, resulting in the delisting of the Ashtabula River Area of Concern. This project will be funded by the Great Lake Restoration Initiative (GLRI).</p>
<p>The project includes the dredging of the three areas within the Federal navigation channel. The total dredging quantity of 100,000 CY is comprised of about 65,000 CY from the outer harbor and lower river area. Approximately 35,000 CY of material will be dredged from the upper river area (the southern reach).<br />As currently anticipated, sediment will most likely be dredged from the harbor using a clamshell bucket. The material will be placed in scows, treated or handled to achieve certain physical properties, then transported to an upland placement site provided by the Government. An offloading and material handling area will be provided to the contractor at Pinney Dock situated just east of the river mouth. The Davis Bacon Act will apply.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dredged Sediment Placement Site<br /></span></strong>The final placement site for the dredged sediments will be located at the Elkem Metals Incorporated site, 2700 Lake Road East, Ashtabula. The main entrance to this facility is approximately 2.0 miles east from Pinney Dock.</p>
<p>The material will be placed in lagoon 5C and will serve as structural fill within the lagoon in preparation for a future lagoon capping project that will be completed by others (independent of USACE involvement). The placed dredged sediments will be required to meet certain physical properties as predicated by both the needs of the closure plan for the final cover design, as well as the movement of construction equipment to place and spread the dredged material in the lagoon. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Dredged Sediment Treatment/Handling<br /></strong></span>Sediment will be required to meet certain minimum physical properties during placement at the Elkem site.<br /><br />1. Unconfined compressive strength equal to 5.2 psi (or undrained shear strength of 2.6 psi )<br />2. Density: Moist or saturated density of 85% of the optimum dry density (reduced proctor)<br /><br />An alternative considered to facilitate these properties in the dredged material, would be to treat the more fine grained dredged material with a commercial mixture of quicklime and cement, such as Calciment&reg; by mixing. This method has been used in a number of similar projects. Pre-design testing has indicated that this may be a feasible alternative for treating the dredged material. The selected contractor may utilize other methods of material treatment to meet project requirements for the placed sediments.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Water Management</span></strong> <br />Retention of solids throughout the project is of paramount importance; as such direct discharge of water entrained during dredging to the harbor would be limited to a total suspended solids concentration of 100 mg/L. This TSS level has been correlated to a turbidity level of 150 NTU for field monitoring purposes. This level would have to be established prior to discharge, and would also apply to direct discharges of runoff associated with the dredged material. Excess water to be discharged back to the harbor may have to be retained for treatment of gross suspended solids prior to discharge. Among other work plans, the contractor would develop a water management plan describing the planned methods for managing water entrained during dredging as well as storm water run-on and runoff at the offloading and disposal site. It would describe the methods to be used in preventing and controlling storm water run-on and runoff, methods for collecting and managing water that accumulates at the disposal site, and address effluent monitoring and reporting. Again, direct discharges back to the harbor/Lake would be subject to the standards set forth by the Corps to ensure the discharge of dredged material meets Section 404 (b)(1) guidelines, including compliance with State water quality standards.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Information<br /></span></strong>The magnitude of construction is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000<br />Each contractor must meet full bonding capacity.<br />NAICS Code: 237990<br />Small Business Size Standard: $33.5M<br />All offerors are advised that they must be registered in CCR (<a href="http://www.CCR.gov">www.CCR.gov</a>) and ORCA (<a href="http://orca.bpn.gov">http://orca.bpn.gov</a>) in order to receive an award.&nbsp; Joint ventures must also be registered as a joint venture.&nbsp; We advise offerors to begin this process when they prepare their proposal in order to ensure registration is in place should they be selected for award.<br /><br />Contractor shall comply with commercial and industry standards, and all applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and procedures.<br /><br />In accordance with FAR 19.501(c) through market research and review of the <br />acquisition a determination will be made if this acquisition will be set aside for a specific small business concern.<br /><br />Interested firms should fill out the attached "USACE BUFFALO DISTRICT Sources Sought Information Request Form" and return their response no later than 3:00pm EST on 9 March 2012.&nbsp; Email your response form to Brooke Hundley, at:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:brooke.m.hundley@usace.army.mil">brooke.m.hundley@usace.army.mil</a></p>

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice VA-701-12-I- 0135
Enterprise-Wide Speech Recognition System

ENTERPRISE-WIDE SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM

I.	Introduction:
This Sources Sought Notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). VA is currently conducting market research to locate qualified, experienced, and interested potential sources. Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be incurred by interested parties in responding to this Sources Sought Notice. 
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking interested sources (contractors) for a near-future solicitation and procurement for an Enterprise-wide Speech Recognition System. At this time, no solicitation exists. Therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.  
A central goal of VA is to ensure the highest level of patient care to our nation's Veterans. A keystone to quality patient care is accurate, timely, and complete medical documentation. The majority of clinical documentation for VHA resides in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), VA's highly regarded electronic health record (EHR). There are a variety of methods for medical documentation entry including manual entry, third-party transcription, and limited usage of speech recognition software. Currently, the primary speech recognition software used by non-radiologists is Nuance's Dragon Medical.   
To ensure continuation of quality patient care, VHA seeks to purchase a medical-specific Enterprise-wide Speech Recognition System for non-radiology applications. VHA holds approximately 7,000 Nuance licenses that encompass a range of versions (i.e., Versions 6.10.x - 10.1.x,). In establishing an enterprise-wide speech recognition system, VHA seeks to standardize speech recognition software as well as maintain the most current version across VHA facilities. Optimizing an enterprise-wide system improves productivity and user satisfaction of clinicians, reduces cost of transcription, improves accuracy and quality of medical documentation, and ultimately enhances patient-centered care. This system will help with sharing best practices, achieving operational efficiencies, and leveraging economies of scale.  
II.	Requirements:  
A high-level description of the processes and outputs for each of the three (3) functional support areas required to support the desired Enterprise-Wide Speech Recognition System include:  
Speech Recognition System:  
VHA requires medical-specific speech recognition software. Specific hardware/peripheral requirements should also be detailed in your response. The software shall be customized by medical specialty. This system shall work in a centralized, virtual environment behind the VA firewall. Additionally, this software shall have the capability to:
a)	Interface with the Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) products deployed within the VHA and CPRS (or the current interface for VHA electronic health records); 
b)	Replicate medical-specific speech recognition functionality of the software on a mobile device; 
c)	Interface with a variety of input devices (e.g., microphones,) to accommodate user needs; and
d)	Accommodate varying accents of spoken English.
Implementation Support and Ongoing Maintenance: 
VHA requires strategies to transition from the current state of speech recognition technology to a centralized and unified state. This includes:
a)	Migration of existing environment;
b)	Implementation plan; 
c)	Site-installation plans;
d)	Customer service support;
e)	Ongoing maintenance (including a Continuity of Operations Plan); and
f)	Software updates.
Training: 
Historically, VA has a subset of users who underutilize speech recognition technology. Accordingly, VHA requires cost-effective and efficient training strategies to optimize user proficiency.

<a href="mailto:ASHANTE.BOOKER@VA.GOV">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>Department of Veterans Affairs, VA West Los Angeles Healthcare System intends to procure a Fluorescent Accelerated Cell Sorter (FACS) for the Research and Development Department from BD Biosciences under the authority for Other Than Full and Open Competition, FAR Part 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source"; as requested by the VA Long Beach Network Contracting Office, VISN 22 (NCO 22); for procurement request 691-12-2-821-0184 in the amount of $178,002.11.

Synopsis:
A one-time firm-fixed priced purchase order is the requested procurement action for the removal and disposal; purchase; and subsequent installation of a FACS-JAZZ manufactured by Becton Dickenson (BD) Biosciences.   This device is crucial to Research and Development laboratory.  Our current FACS has outlived its useful life; is fully depreciated; and is currently decommission and red-tagged because of its dangerous disrepair.  FACS require dismantling and biohazard disposal. This step must be completed before the new FACS can be installed. A salvage/trade-in value must be negotiated in conjunction with this procurement.

Required line items are as followed:

1. BD FACSJAZZ 4B100/2R50					1EA	$220,000.00
2. BATH 115V/60HZ/12AMPS UL/CE RCRCLTG		1EA	$6,233.11
3. CART FACS JAZZ						1EA	$1,869.00
4. Dismantle and Disposal (FACSVantage S/N #SE0024)	1EA	N/C
5. Salvage/Trade-In (FACSVantage S/N #SE0024)		1EA	(-$50,100) 
6. Installation (BD FACSJAZZ 4B100/2R50)			1EA	N/C
7. FOB Destination						1EA	N/C
8. 2 day Training Course (2 employees) 				2EA	N/C
including all course materials and operations manuals.

Equipment Description: BD FACS-JAZZ
FACS rapidly separates cells in a suspension fluid on the basis of size and the color of their fluorescence into a thin stream so that all the cells pass in single file. This stream emerges from a nozzle vibrating at some 40,000 cycles per second which breaks the stream into 40,000 discrete droplets each second.  Some of these droplets may contain a cell, or not. A laser beam is then directed at the stream just before it breaks up into droplets. As each labeled cell passes through the beam, its resulting fluorescence is detected by a photocell. If the signals from the two detectors meet either of the criteria set for fluorescence and size, an electrical charge ( + or - ) is given to the droplet. The droplets retain this charge as they pass between a pair of charged metal plates. Positively-charged drops are attracted to the negatively-charged plate and vice versa. Uncharged droplets (those that contain no cell or a cell that fails to meet the desired criteria of fluorescence and size) pass straight into a third container and are later discarded. This apparatus can sort as many as 300,000 cells per minute.

<p>STATEMENT OF DUTIES</p>
<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR</p>
<p>A. BACKGROUND<br />The US Department of State (DOS) Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs' (INL) mission is to minimize the impact of international crime and illegal drugs on the US and its citizens through global cooperation. INL's Office of Western Hemisphere Programs (INL/WHP) develops narcotics control and anticrime policy initiatives for countries in the Western Hemisphere who produce and transit narcotics. INL/WHP provides overall program and policy direction for INL bilateral narcotics and anticrime assistance programs at overseas posts; develops and revises drug and crime strategies, and coordinates program development with other US agencies.</p>
<p>INL/WHP is responsible for coordinating policy and programs with other United States Government (USG) departments and agencies involved in international narcotics control and crime activities, including the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), the Departments of Defense (DOD), Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Treasury, and the Agency for International Development.</p>
<p>Purpose<br />The purpose of this position is to provide an INL Coordinator to the Narcotics Affairs Office (NAO) at the US Embassy in San Jose. The Coordinator advises on the implementation of bilateral and regional USG and Government of Costa Rica (GOCR) International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) projects. The Coordinator oversees the acquisition/budget, travel/training, and effective prosecution/safe community functions/programs by supervising the Locally Employed Staff (LES) who have responsibilities within these areas.</p>
<p>Relationships <br />The Coordinator will report to the Narcotics Affairs Officer or an assigned delegate. As a recognized authority in financial and organizational management programs and issues, the Coordinator receives only administrative and policy direction concerning overall program priorities and objectives. Specific assignments originate frequently from liaison activities and the Coordinator negotiates the draft scope and project objectives independently with little direction from the supervisor.</p>
<p>Since the position is located physically in San Jose, the Coordinator will exercise independent judgment in developing new and improved approaches to analyze and review NAO/INL programs throughout Costa Rica.</p>
<p>B. STATEMENT OF WORK<br />A. Knowledge Specific<br />1) Provide senior-level advice and assistance in planning, developing, and administering NAO/GOCR citizen safety, law enforcement, and rule of law programs</p>
<p>2) Assist the US Embassy with institutionalizing GOCR law enforcement and justice sector personnel capabilities to become self-sufficient; ensure USG citizen safety, law enforcement, and rule of law interests are well served</p>
<p>3) Coordinate the implementation of policies and strategies related to citizen safety, law enforcement, rule of law, and counternarcotics, this includes strategic planning, setting priorities, and evaluating bilateral programs</p>
<p>4) Initiate studies and advise NAO and GOCR partners on strategic planning, leadership, management, and organizational requirements and reforms</p>
<p>5) Coordinate the development of internal control reviews and initiatives across NAO programs for establishing new management and administrative systems and changes required by the increase / decreasing of citizen safety, law enforcement, and rule of law assistance programs</p>
<p>6) Identify areas for independent, professional evaluations; design the scope of the evaluations and provide expert guidance to US Embassy personnel in contracting for the evaluations</p>
<p>7) Serve as the coordinator for the NAO/GOCR agreed-upon actions to improve GOCR and NAO operation efficiency</p>
<p>8) Work with GOCR and USG agencies to evaluate and identify weaknesses within GOCR citizen safety, law enforcement, and rule of law command relationships; analyze operational problems at police and judicial headquarters and in the field including areas of operational planning as it relates to logistics, tactical movements, physical security, and intelligence</p>
<p>9) Assist US Embassy on issues related to citizen safety, law enforcement, and rule of law, with special focus on seeking out synergies and avoiding duplication within the US interagency</p>
<p>10) Supervise and oversee the training and development of NAO LES members who are responsible for functions involving acquisitions, budget, travel, training, end-use monitoring, and the Effective Prosecution &amp; Safe Communities Program; ensure successful completion of work assigned to the LES team</p>
<p>B. Bilateral Agreements<br />Coordinate USG-GOCR bilateral agreements on INL-funded citizen safety, law enforcement, rule of law, and counternarcotics programs; advise negotiators for the Letters of Agreement (LOAs) in accordance with INL policies, international agreements, and laws, including the formulation of draft LOAs</p>
<p>C. General<br />1) Assist the NAO in developing citizen safety, law enforcement, rule of law, and counternarcotics strategies and programs, as directed</p>
<p>2) Coordinate closely with Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies and, where applicable, US military representatives in Costa Rica</p>
<p>3) Evaluate internal controls to ensure conformance with the myriad laws and regulations under which INL administers the NAO programs</p>
<p>4) Evaluate management controls, develop innovative program concepts, and train NAO staff to ensure the proper utilization of USG provided commodities; this includes oversight and end-use monitoring to ensure that NAO programs are not subject to waste, fraud, or mismanagement</p>
<p>5) Evaluate and advise the US Embassy on the performance of GOCR agencies operating in conjunction with NAO/INL assets and resources to evaluate and recommend the need for training</p>
<p>6) Provide expert analysis and guidance in project procurement, budget preparation, and program planning</p>
<p>7) Ensure implementation of commodity procurement requirements and the preparation of related project/program documentation support; provide advice and coordination in matters pertaining to commodity maintenance and field support</p>
<p>8) Conduct senior-level field surveys, evaluations, and special studies, as directed</p>
<p>9) Brief USG executive and legislative branches and visiting officials on the status of NAO/INL programs</p>
<p>10) Reside in San Jose and travel and work in the field occasionally as circumstances dictate</p>
<p>D. Knowledge <br />The Coordinator shall exercise considerable judgment in interpreting and adapting existing precedents and developing new or improved approaches to analyze controversial and nationally important subjects to persons with conflicting views. INL recognizes the Coordinator as an expert in the development and/or interpretation of guidance on financial and organizational management issues.</p>
<p>Guidelines related to the functions of this position include basic legislation, in particular Chapter 8 of the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) of 1961, other authorities under the FAA, Narcotics Control Acts, Narcotics Control Trade Act, Arms Export Control Act, provisions of DOD authorization acts, provisions of the annual Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Program Appropriations Act (which appropriates funds for the INL programs), other supplemental appropriation laws, and the DOS Basic Authorities Act.</p>
<p>E. Complexity <br />This position involves planning, organizing, and completing financial and organizational analysis of enormous complexity. Due to the high visibility and political sensitivity of the issues in which INL and NAO are involved, there is extreme difficulty in identifying the nature of the issues and planning, organizing, and determining the scope and depth of studies/audits to be undertaken. The Coordinator may encounter difficulty in separating the substantive nature of programs or issues into their components and determining the nature and magnitude of programs or issues, as well as in discerning the intent of legislation and policy statements and determining how to translate the intent into program actions.</p>
<p>F. Scope and effectiveness <br />The Coordinator performs broad and extensive assignments related to a complex administrative/financial program spanning the full range of citizen safety, law enforcement, rule of law, and counternarcotics programs in Costa Rica, which is of significant interest to the public and to the Congress.</p>
<p>G. G. Personal Contacts <br />The Coordinator works closely with the NAO, US Embassy senior management, INL, and with other agency senior managers. The Coordinator may deal with principal and senior management representatives from private sector firms with existing or pending contractual relationships with the DOS, as well as Congressional staffs. The Coordinator shall maintain contact with senior GOCR officers, including within the police and justice sector.</p>
<p>C. MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS<br />1) US Citizen, able to obtain and maintain DOS Secret security and appropriate medical clearances</p>
<p>2) A Bachelor's degree from an accredited institution, preferably in the areas of business management, accounting, finance, international development, international affairs, political science, or public administration</p>
<p>3) Ten (10) years demonstrated experience in planning, organizing, and directing working groups and negotiating effectively with management to accept and implement recommendations where the proposals involve substantial agency resources. This requires the ability to coordinate the work of technical specialists and resolve major conflicts in policy and program objectives as they occur</p>
<p>4) Demonstrated experience drafting highly complex, technical analytical briefing papers, memoranda, letters, and reports for review and/or signature by senior level officials such as the Ambassador or Deputy Chief of Mission</p>
<p>5) Seven (7) years experience with implementing rule of law, counternarcotics, and law enforcement issues within the DOS, INL, Drug Enforcement Administration, or other Federal agencies</p>
<p>6) Demonstrated strong verbal and written skills and an ability to present and defend complex analyses and proposals concisely</p>
<p>7) Proven ability to speak, understand, read, and write Spanish at the FSI level 3/3</p>
<p>8) Working level proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite</p>
<p>9) Ability to complete the FSI Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) course within the first 75 days of assignment successfully</p>
<p>10) Knowledge and experience working with international counternarcotics, anticrime, or similar programs; experience drafting Federal reports/documents, annual budgets, and strategic plan submissions</p>
<p>11) Ten (10) years demonstrated experience working with and/or managing USG programs involving procurements in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations and USG fiscal policies to include proper use and control of various sources of government funding and completing budget submissions and strategic planning inputs</p>
<p>Preferred Qualifications <br />1) Professional training and hands-on experience in the areas of USG procurement, post award contract administration, and USG finance</p>
<p>2) Substantive knowledge and experience with Central America citizen's safety, law enforcement, rule of law, and counternarcotics policies and issues</p>
<p>3) Ability to project and analyze the potential effects of actions on program viability and attainment of program objectives</p>
<p>D. EVALUATION CRITERIA<br />Factor 1 Program Management (30%)<br />Demonstrated experience in program management especially programs involving multiple agencies to include foreign government entities; to include experience involving analytical, planning, advisory, operational, or evaluative duties, where identifying training requirements and initiating training programs was necessary</p>

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(C.4)  The completed FIR, Exceptions Log, currency and checks, notes found in envelopes, foreign currency, non-negotiable forms for payment (i.e. State Camp Coupons, Food Stamps, Postage Stamps, etc.), and opened envelopes will be returned to the park within one business day of receipt by the Contractor.  (C.5)  Fee envelopes will be returned to the serial numbered bags in which they were received by the Contractor.

This will include the NPS count of the number of envelopes, if any, and serial number(s) of security bag(s) to be transferred to the Contractor.  The envelopes will be delivered to the Contractor as agreed between the NPS and Contractor.  Two contractor employees will sign the top portion of the FIR as proof of receipt for the bags received.  The NPS will retain a copy of the FIR, leaving one with the Contractor to document completion of deposit preparation. (C)  Return of Bank-Ready Deposit & Documentation:  When each funds bag is opened by the contractor in a secure facility, the Contractor's employees will open all envelopes, remove and count all cash, coin, and checks, and complete the FIR.  For each camping fee funds bag, Contractor employees will complete the Exceptions Log documenting discrepancies between the fee indicated on each envelope and the fee contained in each envelope.  The Contractor will use the check endorsement stamp furnished by the NPS to endorse checks received for payment of fees.  The completed FIR, Exceptions Log, currency and checks, notes found in envelopes, foreign currency, non-negotiable forms for payment (i.e. State Camp Coupons, Food Stamps, Postage Stamps, etc.), and opened envelopes will be returned to the park within one business day of receipt by the Contractor.  Fee envelopes will be returned to the serial numbered bags in which they were received by the Contractor.  All non-negotiable material will be returned attached to the FIR representing the bag in which the item was found.(D)  Billing for Work Performed:  Contractor will provide an invoice for work performed each month within 10 days of the end of the month.  Invoice will specify time worked by date and by FIR. (E) Errors:  The contractor is expected to have an over-looked (failure to empty) envelope rate of less than 1% per year based on NPS spot-checks and routine review of processed deposit materials.  Contractor is expected to have a FIR funds count error rate of less than 1% per year based on actual confirmed bank deposits.(F):  Unusual Expectations:  If the number of camping fee exceptions found in a deposit seems significant to the Contractor, based on experience with similar deposits, the Contractor will immediately contact the Revenue and Fee Business Manager. (G)  Definition of Terms:  (G.1) Exception Log:  Form used to document discrepancies between the fee indicated on each envelope and the actual fee (monetary amount) contained in each envelope.  This is used only for Camping Fee envelopes.  (G.2) FIR:    Olympic National Park Funds Intake Report.  (G.3) SOP:  Standard Operating Procedure.  
INSPECTION/AUDIT:  (A) The NPS shall have the right to send its employees into the Contractor's processing premises for inspections of facilities and operations as they relate to the contract. Contractor personnel shall, at their discretion, accompany NPS employees during their inspections.  The NPS will provide the Contractor with a list of authorized employees to perform such inspections (with appropriate identification).  Any changes to the list will be provided in writing to the Contractor.  (B) Right to Examine and Audit:  The Contractor shall maintain and authorize NPS personnel the right to examine and audit records, documents, and other accounting procedures and practices, sufficient to reflect properly all compensation claimed.   (C) Audit Procedures:  The NPS will conduct internal audits in compliance with established National Park Service guidelines.

<DESC>This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity
in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design
capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified
source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The
approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical
data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or
knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate
source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's
procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The
qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering
activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.
The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award,
as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not
been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition.
Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have
been solicited.
  The time required for approval of a new source is normally
such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you
are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the
information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS)
Source Approval Information Brochures listed below.

Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx
Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx

These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on
your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if
this is an item you have never made.
If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS
submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request
for source approval.
  Offers received which fail to provide all data required
by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data
required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award
under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval
request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval
requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet
Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based
on Fleet support needs.  The NAVSUP WSS Commercial Item Identification
Brochureis now available at: "https://www.neco.navy.mil/cib.aspx".

<p>BASIS FOR AWARD: The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible quoter(s) whose quotation is responsive to the solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government, using the tradeoff approach. Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each quoter's quotation against the evaluation criteria described below. In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the evaluated price. The Government is more concerned with obtaining a superior Technical Capability quotation than making an award at the lowest evaluated price. However, the Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superiority of one technical and management quotation over another. Thus, to the extent that quoters's technical and past performance quotations are evaluated as close or similar in merit, the evaluated price is more likely to be a determining factor. To be eligible for award under this solicitation, the quoter must propose each facility that is compliant with the requirements of the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-391) (15 U.S.C. 2201 et. seq.) and is listed on the U.S. Fire Administration Hotel and Motel National Master List found at http://www.usfa.dhs.gov/applications/hotel.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: The Evaluation Factors to be applied by the Government in the evaluation process in Descending Order of Importance is described as follows: technical capability, past performance and price. Overall, technical capability and past performance when combined are more important than price in the Tradeoff assessment. Price will be evaluated for reasonableness.

FACTOR 1: Technical Capability: The Government will evaluate Technical Capability based on (1) Contract Requirements: The quoter must provide all of the contract requirements relating to meeting space, food and beverage, AV equipment and support and reporting requirements at each location.

(3) Availability of Dates: Quotations will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide the required services on the dates required for all six events. FACTOR II: Past Performance: The Government will evaluate past performance based on a minimum of three (3) references for similar work or project information which would demonstrate the essential experience and skills necessary to address the requirements of this RFQ.

This factor will indicate the relevant aspects of the quoter's record of performing services similar in size, content and complexity to the requirements of this RFQ.

The Government reserves the right to make contract award without discussions with quoters (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)).

<DESC>The US Geological Survey, Geologic Division, Earthquake Hazards Team, requests a brand name, or equal, product to an ELSYS TraNET EPC-32 high speed digitizer/transient recorder.
Laboratory experiments investigating the generation of high frequency seismic waves during stick-slip of simulated faults have showed that high frequency (100 kHz-5MHz) waves are radiated during rupture nucleation, initiation, and propagation. An accurate recording of the high frequency waves is critical to understanding the physics of rupture nucleation, initiation, and propagation, and how seismic waves are generated by these processes. Therefore, we require a wide-bandwidth, multichannel, analogue-to-digital converter which does not distort recorded signals. This high speed digitizer must be capable of accurately recording high frequency waveforms up to 5 MHz with 14-16 bit dynamic range while also recording low frequency waveforms down to 200 Hz.
We have determined that the Elsys TraNET EPC-32 will fulfill our needs. Requirements of the analogue-to-digital recording system include:- 16 time-synchronized channels, field expandable up to 32 channels- BNC female input connectors- 1 M Ohm input impedance on all channels- variable input range from +/- 50 m V up to +/- 50 V- operating bandwidth: 200 Hz to 5 MHz at all input ranges- at least 14 bit dynamic range- onboard memory capable of recording at least 16 Msamples per channel- at least 70 dB sin ratio at 5 MHz- triggering capabilities: positive/negative edge, window, AND, slew rate, and pulse width- integrated software for viewing and analyzing signals before they are written to hard disk- multi block data capture mode with no dead-time between blocks
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in affect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-55, effective 02 Feb 2012. 
This requirement is subject to the information in the attached "Instructions, Requirements, and Provisions." As well, see solicitation RFQ Standard Form 18 with list of the Contract Line Items.   The Government anticipates award of a commercial, Firm-Fixed Price type contract.  All firms must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at www.ccr.gov, as well as, the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) to be considered for award.  Please contact the Contract Specialist, in writing, by email at zbuss@usgs.gov, with any questions. Questions are due no later than 5:00pm PST on 27 February 2012.
This requirement is unrestricted business size.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334515, Instrument Manufacturing for Measuring and Testing Electricity and Electrical Signals. Size Standard for Small Business is 500 employees.

<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">2. Disposal offsite for useful purposes In the interest of conservation, it is required that the Contractor make a reasonable effort to dispose of the material offsite for some useful purpose. Timber may be cut into convenient lengths and utilized for making saw logs, posts, cordwood, wood chips for paper making or other uses, or other similar use.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The main areas of debris are identified on the attached map.</p>

<p>(End of provision addendum)</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2 - Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999) (Addendum)</p>
<p>EVALUATION CRITEIA</p>
<p>An IDIQ will be awarded to the company determined to represent the best value to the USCG. IAW FAR 15.101-1, the Government will determine the best value using the tradeoff process. The tradeoff process will lead to an award decision that is made between the following price and non-priced evaluation factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1: Technical and Management Approach<br />Factor 2: Relevant Past Performance<br />Factor 3: Socio-Economic Factors (Small Business Subcontracting Plan)<br />Factor 4: Price</p>
<p>Selection and award of the IDIQ award will be based on the previously aforementioned evaluation criteria. The evaluation factors listed above are in descending order of importance. All evaluation factors are more important than price. When combined, the evaluation factors are significantly more important than price. Technical and management approach is more important than past performance and small business subcontracting plan. However, as the technical and management approach, past performance, and small business subcontracting plan converge, the price may become more important. For each factor, offerors are required to provide the information described below:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical and Management Approach: The Government will evaluate each offeror's technical and management approach to determine their capacity to perform all the requirements outlined in the Performance Work Statement (PWS). This will include the evaluation of the following sub-factors:</p>
<p>Sub-Factor 1 <br />The offeror's management approach of the project and its personnel</p>
<p>Sub-Factor 2 <br />The offeror's technical approach to providing the required services</p>
<p>Sub-Factor 3 <br />The offeror's proposed course content including the number of man hours proposed for the instruction and preparation of each course</p>
<p>Sub-Factor 3 <br />The offeror's proposed instruction course facilities including the possession of, or access to, a GV aircraft</p>
<p>Sub-Factor 4 <br />The offeror's existing course schedule<br /><br />Sub-Factor 5 <br />The offeror's proposed instructor's qualifications</p>
<p>Overall rating for Factor One will be at the factor level. All sub-factors are of equal importance and contribute to the overall Factor rating.</p>
<p>Factor 2- Relevant Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the past performance of the offeror for relevancy. The offeror shall provide past performance information for services directly related and relevant to the services to be performed under the PWS. To be considered relevant, the services must have been performed within the past three years. The USCG reserves the right to utilize past performance information other than the information submitted with the proposals received in conducting the evaluation. A Contractor without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance, but will receive a neutral rating. The USCG may consider past performance information regarding predecessor companies or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is considered relevant.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Socio-Economic Factors</p>
<p>Sub-Factor 1 <br />The Government will evaluate the offeror's small business subcontracting plan. As small businesses are not required to submit a small business subcontracting plan, small business offerors will receive the highest rating for this factor. Large businesses that do not plan to submit a small business subcontracting plan must submit a signed statement that states why they will not subcontract any work of the resultant contract. Doing so will receive a neutral rating and will not be rated favorably or unfavorably. Large businesses' submitted subcontracting plans will be evaluated as to the degree to which the subcontracting plan meets fiscal year 2012 USCG small business subcontracting goals, which are stated as follows: <br />- 45% small businesses <br />- 5% small disadvantaged businesses<br />- 5% women owned small businesses<br />- 3% HUBZone businesses<br />- 3% small disadvantaged veteran owned small businesses<br /><br />Sub-Factor 2 <br />Large businesses' offeror's history of compliance with subcontracting reporting requirements in other federal contracts and how well the large businesses have met planned small business subcontracting goals in previous award will be evaluated. If a large business does not submit a small business subcontracting plan they will receive a neutral rating and will not be rated favorably or unfavorably. This will be evaluated using the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System at http://www.esrs.gov</p>
<p>Overall rating for Factor Three will be at the factor level. Both sub-factors are of equal importance and contribute to the overall Factor rating.</p>
<p>Factor 4 - Price: The Government will evaluate the total overall price to determine price reasonableness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-</p>
<p>(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;</p>
<p>(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]</p>

<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-</p>
<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>
<p>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)</p>

<p>HSAR 3052.209-72 - Organization Conflict of Interest (Jun 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Determination. The Government has determined that this effort may result in an actual or potential conflict of interest, or may provide one or more offerors with the potential to attain an unfair competitive advantage. The nature of the conflict of interest and the limitation on future contracting is currently unknown.</p>
<p>(b) If any such conflict of interest is found to exist, the Contracting Officer may:</p>
<p>(1) Disqualify the offeror, or</p>
<p>(2) Determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the United States to contract with the offeror and include the appropriate provisions to avoid, neutralize, mitigate, or waive such conflict in the contract awarded. After discussion with the offeror, the<br />Contracting Officer may determine that the actual conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, mitigated or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the Government, and the offeror may be found ineligible for award.</p>
<p>(c) Disclosure: The offeror hereby represents, to the best of its knowledge that: ___</p>
<p>(1) It is not aware of any facts which create any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest relating to the award of this contract, or ___</p>
<p>(2) It has included information in its proposal, providing all current information bearing on the existence of any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest, and has included a mitigation plan in accordance with paragraph (d) of this provision.</p>

Award of a contract where an actual or potential conflict of interest exists shall not occur before Government approval of the mitigation plan. If a mitigation plan is approved, the restrictions of this provision do not apply to the extent defined in the mitigation plan.</p>
<p>(e) Other Relevant Information: In addition to the mitigation plan, the Contracting Officer may require further relevant information from the offeror. The Contracting Officer will use all information submitted by the offeror, and any other relevant information known to DHS, to determine whether an award to the offeror may take place, and whether the mitigation plan adequately neutralizes or mitigates the conflict.</p>
<p>(f) Corporation Change. The successful offeror shall inform the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of the effective date of any corporate mergers, acquisitions, and/or divestures that may affect this provision.</p>
<p>(g) Flow-down. The contractor shall insert the substance of this clause in each first tier subcontract that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>

<p>SECTION IV<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman<br />Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman<br />Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103.</p>
<p>If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
<p><br /><br />--------------------<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />SECTION V<br />PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR TRAINING SUPPORT SERVICES FOR THE <br />U.S. COAST GUARD OFFICE OF SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH<br />AVIATION DIVISION (CG-1131)<br />INDEFINITE DELIVERY, INDEFINITE QUANTITY (IDIQ)</p>
<p>1.0 GENERAL.</p>
<p>1.1 SCOPE. <br />This effort requires the Contractor to make available quotas in the six (6) listed short term instructional courses (no longer than five weeks each), or courses very similar in content and description, for maintenance of the Coast Guard's Gulfstream V (GV) aircraft:<br />(1) GV Basic Maintenance Training course - up to 6 quotas annually.<br />(2) GV Avionics Training course - up to 4 quotas annually.<br />(3) GV Cabin Communications Training course - up to 2 quotas annually.<br />(4) GV Advanced Troubleshooting Procedures course - up to 4 quotas annually.<br />(5) GV Updated Maintenance Practices course - up to 4 quotas annually.<br />(6) GV Maintenance Management course - up to 1 quota annually.</p>
<p>To fulfill the quotas, it will require the Contractor to provide the classes above to the Coast Guard. All classes will require the Contractor to provide classroom instruction. Requirements regarding course and lab facilities are outlined in PWS 5.0. Additionally, the effort requires the contractor to make available a GV aircraft, course lab with specialized troubleshooting equipment and software, and maintenance training aids.</p>
<p>1.2 BACKGROUND. <br />The U.S. Coast Guard, Chief of Aeronautical Engineering, (CG-41) is responsible for all maintenance action performed by the aircraft mechanics and aircraft technicians at Air Station Washington, D.C (AS DC). The U.S. Coast Guard employs a bi-level maintenance structure. This structure consists of depot level maintenance and organizational maintenance. The U.S. Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center located in Elizabeth City, NC coordinates depot level maintenance for all Coast Guard Aircraft. Each Air Station is responsible for completing organizational maintenance at their unit. The organizational maintenance performed by mechanics and technicians at AS DC provides safe and operable GV aircraft which are used to transport the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, the Commandant of the Coast Guard, and other dignitaries.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the Coast Guard would create and maintain an organic training capability for mechanics and technicians responsible for maintaining GV Aircraft. However, since the Coast Guard operates only a limited quantity of GV aircraft at one time, it is not cost effective for the Coast Guard to maintain an organic training capability. In order to ensure aircrew and passenger safety as well as proper operation of its GV aircraft, the Coast Guard needs to contract maintenance training for AS DC mechanics and technicians.</p>
<p>1.3 CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL.</p>
<p>1.3.1 Qualified Personnel.<br />The Contractor shall provide qualified instructor personnel to perform all requirements under each task order awarded under this IDIQ contract.</p>

Each instructor must have graduated from an equivalent course they are teaching. Experience must be outlined in each instructor's resume. It is desired, but not required, that each instructor, at a minimum, possess a current FAA A&amp;P certification and an FAA IA certification. It is preferred that the instructors have completed their equivalent courses at the Gulfstream-Flight Safety International Total Technical Training program.</p>
<p>1.3.3 Employee Identification. <br />Visiting Contractor employees shall comply with all Government escort rules and requirements. All Contractor employees shall identify themselves as Contractors when their status is not readily apparent and display all identification and visitor badges in plain view above the waist at all times.</p>
<p>1.3.4 Employee Conduct. <br />Contractor employees shall present a professional appearance at all times and their conduct shall not reflect discredit upon the United States, the Department of Homeland Security and the United States Coast Guard.</p>
<p>1.3.5 Removing Employees for Misconduct or Security Reasons. <br />The Government may, at its sole discretion, direct the Contractor to remove any Contractor employee from U.S. Coast Guard facilities for misconduct or security reasons. Removal does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue providing the services required under each task order awarded under this IDIQ. The Contracting Officer will provide the Contractor with a written explanation to support any request to remove an employee.</p>
<p>1.3.6 Conflict of Interest. <br />The Contractor shall not employ any person who is an employee of the United States Government if that employment would, or would appear to cause a conflict of interest.</p>
<p>1.4 PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE. <br />The base period of performance for this effort is five (5) years from the date of award.</p>
<p>1.5 PLACE OF PERFORMANCE. The work to be performed under each task order will be performed at a training site provided by the Contractor. For maintenance training, the Contractor shall posses a GV aircraft.</p>
<p>1.6 HOURS OF OPERATION. <br />Contractor employees shall generally perform all training between the hours of 0800 and 1600, Monday through Friday.</p>
<p>1.7 PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY. <br />Task orders issued under this contract will be performance based and incorporate the Performance Requirements Summary (PWS) outlined in PWS 8.0. In general, the PRS will set forth the expected outcomes (objectives) of the task order, the service(s) required of the contractor to attain the objectives, a performance standard per outcome, and a plan for a reduction in payment in the event the contractor does not meet the performance standard. It is the intent of the Government to maintain consistency in standards and associated reduction schedules for same or similar outcomes from task order to task order. The PRS is not an exclusive remedy and inclusion of the PRS does not preclude the Government from using any other remedy available by law or contract terms, including reductions in payment in accordance with any clause for inspection of services.</p>

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the agency.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372-3695.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director (OFDA/OD). The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs), including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and man-made disaster situations. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to the complex emergency in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), OFDA operates an office headquartered at the USAID Mission in Kinshasa, DRC. The office is responsible for overseeing the portfolio of OFDA-funded activities in DRC. In Fiscal Year 2011, USAID/OFDA provided more than $33.5 million to support agriculture and food security, economic recovery and market systems, humanitarian coordination and information management, health, nutrition, protection, and water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions, as well as the provision of logistics support and relief commodities.</p>
<p>This Senior Program Officer (SPO) will be OFDA's principal humanitarian representative who will direct and coordinate humanitarian programs in Eastern DRC. The SPO will assist with assessment and monitoring of existing or evolving crises, maintenance of partner relationship, and facilitation of award management activities. The SPO will be based in Kinshasa.</p>
<p>The SPO will report to OFDA's Senior Humanitarian Advisor (SHA) for DRC. Under the guidance of the SHA or OFDA Director's designee, he/she will coordinate closely with USAID and Embassy staff and exchange information regularly with colleagues covering DRC portfolios, as well as with the field and headquarters-based OFDA regional team. This includes sharing project ideas, strategies, and soliciting advice and guidance. The Senior Program Officer will also work closely with the Agreement Officer's Representative (AOR) for all assigned awards. He/she may supervise up to two Foreign Service Nationals.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires the services of one Senior Program Officer for DRC to more effectively manage its humanitarian assistance programs in DRC.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The OFDA Senior Program Officer will primarily provide full time in-country coordination and management of the humanitarian emergency and disaster risk reduction efforts throughout the area of responsibility. The Senior Program Officer may assist in humanitarian assistance activities in the region as needed.</p>
<p>This position requires substantial daily coordination with several OFDA staff members, as well as with representatives from other USAID offices, Embassy staff, and the humanitarian community, and therefore requires a highly collaborative work style. The Senior Program Officer must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly adhere to U.S. Embassy security guidelines. The incumbent may be required to serve as a critical component of a U.S. Government disaster assessment team, DART, RMT, or to backfill other staff members in the overseas office.</p>
<p>The Senior Program Officer's responsibilities will include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as one of the principal points-of-contact for OFDA humanitarian issues in DRC. Coordinate closely with both field and headquarters-based components of OFDA's Regional Team and maintain regular contact with development assistance colleagues in the USAID Mission and/or US Embassy.</p>
<p>&bull; Serve a primary role in the development of OFDA's response and disaster risk reduction strategies in the area of responsibility, ensure complementarity between the two strategies, and oversee implementation of each.</p>
<p>&bull; Assess a broad spectrum of emergency conditions to provide recommendations, management oversight, and evaluation of OFDA response programs.</p>
<p>&bull; Maintain regular contact with senior leadership within the humanitarian community and represent USAID and OFDA on humanitarian issues. This will include but is not limited to UN agencies, IOs, and NGOs, U.S. Government personnel, donors, host government authorities, and others on humanitarian issues.</p>
<p>&bull; Travel frequently to assess, evaluate and monitor humanitarian conditions in the area of responsibility, and make strategic recommendations for appropriate interventions.</p>
<p>&bull; Participate in and report on joint donor humanitarian evaluations and UN-led assessments, and participate actively in the international community response structures.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide regular reporting, through official cables and other means, on issues related to the humanitarian situation in the area of responsibility. Provide overviews of patterns and trends in the humanitarian situation and keep the SHA for DRC, Regional Coordinator, and other support staff current on response issues. Provide regular reports on site visits, meetings, general atmospherics and other issues that impact humanitarian relief efforts.</p>
<p>&bull; With guidance from the SHA, coordinate with the donor community on policy issues affecting humanitarian operations, and develop integrated, non-duplicative programs.</p>
<p>&bull; Manage all administrative functions at the field office level and coordinate travel for all humanitarian-related visitors, including VIPs.</p>
<p>&bull; Prepare agendas and briefings for official U.S. Government visitors interested in humanitarian issues.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Senior Program Officer will report to OFDA's Senior Humanitarian Advisor for DRC, located in Kinshasa, DRC, and maintain close coordination with the Disaster Operations Specialist in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The supervisor will provide administrative direction in terms of broadly defined goals and objectives. The incumbent is expected to take initiative and act independently with minimal direction and will exercise independent judgment in responding to humanitarian needs.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11. WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Work is primarily performed in an office setting. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC><p>The mobile unit is not as much an extension of an existing unit as it is using existing shelving to integrate into the unit to complete it. There should be a total of four shelves in each of the 36" deep systems including the base shelf, and a total of six shelves in the 24" deep systems including the base shelf. The shelving shall include complete back and side panels on each system, a digital keypad access system, and motorized movement. The current shelves are grey, and the new shelving should match those. A ceiling and a floor are not necessary and neither are doors.</p>
<p>The digital keypad shall be programmed so each user enters their personal code and the unit will automatically open the fixture that way it can be tracked who the last person to access the equipment stored in each fixture was. It will not interface with any existing security systems. There shall be one key pad per shelving unit and they shall be programmed so each authorized person will have one code assigned per person that will grant them access to all units but no more than one unit can be open at a time. There shall be codes for up to 200 people as well as a safety mechanism so a person cannot be crushed between the units when closing (not a counter).<br />The fixtures not being replaced will be altered to match the new units being installed. This means a steel back, two linoleum sides, and a key pad will be installed on each unit. The wood on the existing shelves will be replaced with ventilated or corrugated shelves (either one). They will need to be on the same track as the other units with motorized movement as well. At this time they are stationary. The first unit will remain stationary but must still be on the track to match height, all others must be mobile. The last two shelving units will face each other so the entire system can be locked up when not in use. To do so, all mobile units shall be closed up towards the stationary unit.<br />All new shelving units' parts must be compatible with the parts of the existing unit manufactured by Lyon.<br /><br />When open, the aisle width shall be 61.5".<br />The shelf arrangement will be as follows:<br />36" Units - base shelf, plus three more shelves approximately 36" apart<br />24" Units - base shelf, plus five more shelves approximately 25" apart<br />The structure shall be designed to support 1,000lbs per shelf, including the top of the unit. It is a possibility that material may be stored up there as well.<br />Tracks will be built into a concrete base so carts may be rolled over the tracks without difficulty</p>
<p>CORRRECTION: The requested mobile storage unit will replace the existing fixed storage unit up to the last two fixtures. These two fixtures are shown in the posted pictures outside of the yellow marked area. These two fixtures will be modified to have backing, as well as the digital keypad that will be on the new fixtures. All fixtures, new and old, will be motorized on an above ground track which will be installed on the existing concrete floor. To secure the unit tracking, small anchors may be installed into the concrete floor. Anchors shall be no larger than &frac14; in. x 2 in.</p>
<p>The old fixtures being replaced are shown within the yellow marked area in the pictures posted. Our own personnel will be removing these fixtures. Therefore, removal shall not be included in this buy.</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF DUTIES</p>
<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR</p>
<p>A. BACKGROUND<br />The US Department of State (DOS) Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs' (INL) mission is to minimize the impact of international crime and illegal drugs on the US and its citizens through global cooperation. INL's Office of Western Hemisphere Programs (INL/WHP) develops narcotics control and anticrime policy initiatives for countries in the Western Hemisphere who produce and transit narcotics. INL/WHP provides overall program and policy direction for INL bilateral narcotics and anticrime assistance programs at overseas posts; develops and revises drug and crime strategies, and coordinates program development with other US agencies.</p>
<p>INL/WHP is responsible for coordinating policy and programs with other United States Government (USG) departments and agencies involved in international narcotics control and crime activities, including the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), the Departments of Defense (DOD), Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Treasury, and the Agency for International Development.</p>
<p>Purpose<br />The purpose of this position is to provide an INL Coordinator to the Narcotics Affairs Office (NAO) at the US Embassy in San Jose. The Coordinator advises on the implementation of bilateral and regional USG and Government of Costa Rica (GOCR) International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) projects. The Coordinator oversees the acquisition/budget, travel/training, and effective prosecution/safe community functions/programs by supervising the Locally Employed Staff (LES) who have responsibilities within these areas.</p>
<p>Relationships <br />The Coordinator will report to the Narcotics Affairs Officer or an assigned delegate. As a recognized authority in financial and organizational management programs and issues, the Coordinator receives only administrative and policy direction concerning overall program priorities and objectives. Specific assignments originate frequently from liaison activities and the Coordinator negotiates the draft scope and project objectives independently with little direction from the supervisor.</p>
<p>Since the position is located physically in San Jose, the Coordinator will exercise independent judgment in developing new and improved approaches to analyze and review NAO/INL programs throughout Costa Rica.</p>
<p>B. STATEMENT OF WORK<br />A. Knowledge Specific<br />1) Provide senior-level advice and assistance in planning, developing, and administering NAO/GOCR citizen safety, law enforcement, and rule of law programs</p>
<p>2) Assist the US Embassy with institutionalizing GOCR law enforcement and justice sector personnel capabilities to become self-sufficient; ensure USG citizen safety, law enforcement, and rule of law interests are well served</p>
<p>3) Coordinate the implementation of policies and strategies related to citizen safety, law enforcement, rule of law, and counternarcotics, this includes strategic planning, setting priorities, and evaluating bilateral programs</p>
<p>4) Initiate studies and advise NAO and GOCR partners on strategic planning, leadership, management, and organizational requirements and reforms</p>
<p>5) Coordinate the development of internal control reviews and initiatives across NAO programs for establishing new management and administrative systems and changes required by the increase / decreasing of citizen safety, law enforcement, and rule of law assistance programs</p>
<p>6) Identify areas for independent, professional evaluations; design the scope of the evaluations and provide expert guidance to US Embassy personnel in contracting for the evaluations</p>
<p>7) Serve as the coordinator for the NAO/GOCR agreed-upon actions to improve GOCR and NAO operation efficiency</p>
<p>8) Work with GOCR and USG agencies to evaluate and identify weaknesses within GOCR citizen safety, law enforcement, and rule of law command relationships; analyze operational problems at police and judicial headquarters and in the field including areas of operational planning as it relates to logistics, tactical movements, physical security, and intelligence</p>
<p>9) Assist US Embassy on issues related to citizen safety, law enforcement, and rule of law, with special focus on seeking out synergies and avoiding duplication within the US interagency</p>
<p>10) Supervise and oversee the training and development of NAO LES members who are responsible for functions involving acquisitions, budget, travel, training, end-use monitoring, and the Effective Prosecution &amp; Safe Communities Program; ensure successful completion of work assigned to the LES team</p>
<p>B. Bilateral Agreements<br />Coordinate USG-GOCR bilateral agreements on INL-funded citizen safety, law enforcement, rule of law, and counternarcotics programs; advise negotiators for the Letters of Agreement (LOAs) in accordance with INL policies, international agreements, and laws, including the formulation of draft LOAs</p>
<p>C. General<br />1) Assist the NAO in developing citizen safety, law enforcement, rule of law, and counternarcotics strategies and programs, as directed</p>
<p>2) Coordinate closely with Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies and, where applicable, US military representatives in Costa Rica</p>
<p>3) Evaluate internal controls to ensure conformance with the myriad laws and regulations under which INL administers the NAO programs</p>
<p>4) Evaluate management controls, develop innovative program concepts, and train NAO staff to ensure the proper utilization of USG provided commodities; this includes oversight and end-use monitoring to ensure that NAO programs are not subject to waste, fraud, or mismanagement</p>
<p>5) Evaluate and advise the US Embassy on the performance of GOCR agencies operating in conjunction with NAO/INL assets and resources to evaluate and recommend the need for training</p>
<p>6) Provide expert analysis and guidance in project procurement, budget preparation, and program planning</p>
<p>7) Ensure implementation of commodity procurement requirements and the preparation of related project/program documentation support; provide advice and coordination in matters pertaining to commodity maintenance and field support</p>
<p>8) Conduct senior-level field surveys, evaluations, and special studies, as directed</p>
<p>9) Brief USG executive and legislative branches and visiting officials on the status of NAO/INL programs</p>
<p>10) Reside in San Jose and travel and work in the field occasionally as circumstances dictate</p>
<p>D. Knowledge <br />The Coordinator shall exercise considerable judgment in interpreting and adapting existing precedents and developing new or improved approaches to analyze controversial and nationally important subjects to persons with conflicting views. INL recognizes the Coordinator as an expert in the development and/or interpretation of guidance on financial and organizational management issues.</p>

<p>E. Complexity <br />This position involves planning, organizing, and completing financial and organizational analysis of enormous complexity. Due to the high visibility and political sensitivity of the issues in which INL and NAO are involved, there is extreme difficulty in identifying the nature of the issues and planning, organizing, and determining the scope and depth of studies/audits to be undertaken. The Coordinator may encounter difficulty in separating the substantive nature of programs or issues into their components and determining the nature and magnitude of programs or issues, as well as in discerning the intent of legislation and policy statements and determining how to translate the intent into program actions.</p>
<p>F. Scope and effectiveness <br />The Coordinator performs broad and extensive assignments related to a complex administrative/financial program spanning the full range of citizen safety, law enforcement, rule of law, and counternarcotics programs in Costa Rica, which is of significant interest to the public and to the Congress.</p>
<p>G. G. Personal Contacts <br />The Coordinator works closely with the NAO, US Embassy senior management, INL, and with other agency senior managers. The Coordinator may deal with principal and senior management representatives from private sector firms with existing or pending contractual relationships with the DOS, as well as Congressional staffs. The Coordinator shall maintain contact with senior GOCR officers, including within the police and justice sector.</p>
<p>C. MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS<br />1) US Citizen, able to obtain and maintain DOS Secret security and appropriate medical clearances</p>
<p>2) A Bachelor's degree from an accredited institution, preferably in the areas of business management, accounting, finance, international development, international affairs, political science, or public administration</p>
<p>3) Ten (10) years demonstrated experience in planning, organizing, and directing working groups and negotiating effectively with management to accept and implement recommendations where the proposals involve substantial agency resources.

<p>4) Demonstrated experience drafting highly complex, technical analytical briefing papers, memoranda, letters, and reports for review and/or signature by senior level officials such as the Ambassador or Deputy Chief of Mission</p>
<p>5) Seven (7) years experience with implementing rule of law, counternarcotics, and law enforcement issues within the DOS, INL, Drug Enforcement Administration, or other Federal agencies</p>
<p>6) Demonstrated strong verbal and written skills and an ability to present and defend complex analyses and proposals concisely</p>
<p>7) Proven ability to speak, understand, read, and write Spanish at the FSI level 3/3</p>
<p>8) Working level proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite</p>
<p>9) Ability to complete the FSI Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) course within the first 75 days of assignment successfully</p>
<p>10) Knowledge and experience working with international counternarcotics, anticrime, or similar programs; experience drafting Federal reports/documents, annual budgets, and strategic plan submissions</p>
<p>11) Ten (10) years demonstrated experience working with and/or managing USG programs involving procurements in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations and USG fiscal policies to include proper use and control of various sources of government funding and completing budget submissions and strategic planning inputs</p>

(1)	The services to be performed under this contract do not require the contractor or his employees to exercise personal judgment and discretion on behalf of the Government, but rather the contractor?s employees will act and exercise personal judgment and discretion on behalf of the contractor.
(2)	Rules, regulations, directions, and requirements which are issued by command authorities under their responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the installation, or who travel on Government transportation.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals? (1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<BR><BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] List end products.<BR><BR>(2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.] [  ] (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. [  ] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. (j) Place of manufacture.

For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly? (1) [ ] In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or<BR><BR>(2) [ ] Outside the United States. (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that? (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. [  ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that? (i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii)); (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies? (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.<BR><BR>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) (1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>The agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by the unique supplies available from only Zodiac Data Systems INC., which possesses unique capabilities demonstrated as follows: The 580th SMXS currently owns and uses HEIM GSSr Data recorders in the 580th SMXS EISE lab environment in building 229E. Currently we have the GSSr recorders installed on the following Operational Flight Program Aircraft Simulators; MC130H, AC130U, AC130H and HH60 Pave Hawk. This action will provide similar recording capabilities for the MC130E platform that will be compatible with the equipment we already have. The only source of these recorders is Zodiac Data Systems, INC.<br />Station drawings would have to be updated and maintained separately, configurations and connections would be different and would be problematic for troubleshooting or hot swapping equipment in case of failures. <br />Additionally, the HEIM d200f in this action is an Airborne Data Recorder that will be used along with currently owned D200f assets. The 580th SMXS currently owns two HEIM D200f Airborne Data Recorders that we use for DT&amp;E software testing. The compatibility with already owned equipment is the focus of the decision to purchase the D200f. The recorder is also modular and the modules are shared between recorders as needed.</p>
<p>DELIVERY - Place of delivery: 580 SMXS/Flight H, Building 229, Robins AFB, GA 31098<br />Purchase Description will be available when RFQ is posted. <br />The approximate RFQ issue date will be&nbsp;28 February&nbsp;2012; proposals are due&nbsp;30 Mar 2012. Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation at www.fedbizopps.gov only. NO TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL BE HONORED and no hard copies will be mailed out.<br />Offerors shall prepare their proposals in accordance with mandatory, explicit, and detailed instructions contained in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate past performance utilizing the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). Proposals will be evaluated and award made in accordance with the evaluation criteria stated in the RFQ. OFFERORS ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO REVIEW RATINGS IN PPIRS FOR ACCURACY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.<br />All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.<br />All questions regarding the RFQ must be submitted in writing to James.Kaari@robins.af.mil.

<DESC>Questions received & responses are provided::


QUESTION ONE:  I note on page 19 that my quote should include state and federal taxes.  Working with the military we never charge tax as they are exempt, is the Burea of Indian Affairs not exempt? 
RESPONSE:    DOD tax exemptions do not apply to civilian agencies.  The contractor is required to contact their respective State Department of Revenue to inquire if they are liable for any taxes when conducting business  w/ the Dept. of Interior.  The percentage does vary from state to state.
The same applies to Federal taxes  -  only the IRS can tell you what Federal taxes, if any, are applicable.


QUESTION TWO:  I also did not note any packaging requirements, is it standard commercial to ASTM 3951?
RESPONSE:   The specification does not require specific packaging,  that is up to the contractor and his supplier.  It is their responsibility to ship the transformers via FOB Destination so they arrive in good condition, undamaged, and can be unloaded by fork lift.

<DESC>**NOTICE TO INDUSTRY ON ERRONEOUS CANCELLATION**<br /><br />On 21 Feb this notice was erroneously cancelled.&nbsp; This notice and subject requirement remains active and is NOT cancelled.&nbsp; We are working to rescind the "Cancellation" Notice within the FedBiz Opps.gov website.<br /><br />Any further clarification on the status should be directed to Lt Col Michael Dombrowski at <a href="mailto:michael.dombrowski@afncr.af.mil">michael.dombrowski@afncr.af.mil</a> .<br /><br /><br />THIS IS AN ANNOUNCMENT FOR AN INDUSTRY DAY TO PERFORM MARKET RESEARCH PURSUANT TO FEDERAL ACQUISTION REGULATIONS (FAR) PART 10. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). This announcement is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for any information solicited or provided as a result of this notice. The result of the market research process may be used, however, to develop the scope for potential future RFPs. This is not a commitment by the Government to issue an RFP nor pay any proposal or proposal preparation costs.
<p>The Government will NOT assume liability for costs incurred by an Industry Day participant for travel expenses, presentations, marketing efforts, data offered for examination, or any other expense associated with attendance.</p>
<p>The Air Force District of Washington (AFDW) Contracting Directorate is hosting an Industry Day on 3 February 2012 at 9:00 (EST) on Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. All information presented during this event will be UNCLASSIFIED. The Industry Day will allow the AFDW to determine the range, scope, capabilities and capacity of potential commercial partners to include small businesses to support future Air Force National Capital Region Information Technology (AFNCR IT) Services. See attachment for further information on the scope of current contracted efforts. The AFDW is seeking industry input with innovative ideas, tools &amp; technology, in support of a full range of unclassified and classified mission essential IT services to the Department of Defense users.</p>
<p>The Air Force anticipates this requirement will be solicited under its "NETCENTS 2" multiple-award contract vehicle but may ultimately be solicited in any manner consistent with the Federal Acquisition Regulation.</p>
<p>Pre-registration for the AFNCR IT Industry Day is required. Attendance at Industry Day is limited to a maximum of 2 individuals per organization. To register for Industry Day, request a One-on-One* meeting with the Government team and submit questions about this requirement email Mr. Sebastian Kaiser-Vu at Sebastian.kaiser-vu@afncr.af.mil with courtesy copies sent to afncr.contract.pmo@pentagon.af.mil and michael.dombrowski@afncr.af.mil. Upon registration, participants will be sent additional details as to specific location and agenda.</p>
<p>Emails shall include:</p>
<p>1) Subject line of email: "AFNCR IT Industry Day RSVP";<br />2) Organization name, address, and CAGE Code;<br />3) List of Organization attendees to include name, email, and phone numbers of each**;<br />4) Organization's request for one-on-one meeting participation, if desired.<br />a. Industry partners from out-of-town locations will receive priority with one-on-one meeting scheduling due to the cost of travel. This does will not exclude any industry partners from scheduling one-on-one meetings with the Government. One-on-one meetings will be scheduled on a first-come-first serve basis.<br />b. The Government is seeking to foster dialogue with industry on new and innovative ideas/approaches to meet its requirements but does not want purely marketing presentations.</p>
<p>Registrations by telephone will not be accepted. Security clearances are not required for this event. The deadline for submitting registrations requests is 31 January 12 to allow sufficient time to process visitor requests for base access.</p>
<p>*All registered participants are asked to submit proposed questions in advance of Industry Day to Mr. Sebastian Kaiser-Vu at Sebastian.kaiser-vu@afncr.af.mil with courtesy copies sent to afncr.contract.pmo@pentagon.af.mil and michael.dombrowski@afncr.af.mil.</p>
<p>** Ensure all attendees bring a valid driver's license for identification purposes at the base main gate. If any of the attendees are not U.S. Citizens, please include this in your registration email, as he/she will need a military escort to receive access onto the base.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>**NOTICE TO INDUSTRY ON ERRONEOUS CANCELLATION**</p>

<p>FROM: 673 CONS/LGCZ 24 Feb 2011</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Request for Small Businesses Comments- Incentives (Suspense COB 3 Mar 11)</p>
<p>1. This is not a request for proposal, but a request for comments from Small Businesses to the attached Installation Support Services (ISS) for Geographically Separated Locations (GSL) Draft Award Term Plan. The contract is targeted for Small Business as a Fixed Price with Incentive Firm (FPIF) and Award Term Options resulting in; a contract witha 6 month Base, four 1 year options and five 1 year Award Term Options. Please review the attached documents and provide comments to the following:</p>
<p>a. Does your company have an adequate accounting system for providing data to support negotiations of an incentive price revision (FAR 16.403-1 (c))?</p>
<p>b. Has your company had a successful Accounting System Survey audit conducted by the DCAA for past awarded contracts?</p>
<p>c. Would this contract incentive preclude your company from proposing? If it would, why?</p>
<p>d. Is a ceiling price (Point of Total Assumption) of 5% appropriate for this type of contract risk? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>e. Do you have any other suggested areas for off contract cost reductions?</p>
<p>f. Are the Evaluation Criteria understandable and well defined? Do you have any additional questions and /or need clarification on any parts of the draft Plan?</p>
<p>2. This incentive approach is in response to the DOD's declining funding, changing business practices and is designed to control and lower cost. The incentive plan for this contract consist of two parts: 1) Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) and 2) Award Terms (AT) for additional five option years. Both require performance standards to be met. The FPIF is designed to provide a positive, calculable profit incentive for the contractor to control costs on an annual basis. The AT targets the reduction of three off contract costs that are within the contractor's control.</p>
<p>3. For additional information about FPIF please refer to FAR 52.216-16 and FAR 16.403-1.</p>
<p>4. Your input is vital to the government's market research of this topic. Please provide responses as soon as possible, but no later than your close of business Thursday, 3 Mar 2011 to both margaret.zerbach@elmendorf.af.mil and stuart.mcelhinney@elemendorf.af.mil.</p>

All interested sources must respond in writing with clear and convincing evidence to support their ability to provide timely and effective services within five (5) days of this publication. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.

<DESC>It is the government's intent to extend task order FA8823-11-F-0001 two weeks to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. This extension is necessary to continue to meet mission critical requirements, mitigate the impact of personnel turnover, and to support transition to competitively award a follow-on task order. The period of performance for this extension is 28 January 2012 through 10 February 2012. This extension is strictly for the continuation of Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) to the Space and Missile Systems Center, Space Logistics Directorate and related space organizations. This extension will support the Air Force's immediate need to bridge a gap in service from the end of the current A&amp;AS task order which expires&nbsp;27 January 2012 and award of the follow-on task order. This notice is for informational purposes only and is not a request for competitive proposals. As stated above, the Air Force intends to award the two-week extension described herein to the incumbent contractor.
