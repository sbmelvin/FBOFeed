The requirement is for the contractor to provide all personnel, supervision, and any items and services necessary to perform full food services at FLETC, Georgia. This sources sought synopsis is issued to determine if there are contractors capable of and interested in providing the required services and to assist FLETC in making a set-aside decision (current contract services are being provided by a Randolph-Sheppard Act contractor).

Parties must also indicate their business size status in relation to the applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 722310 (size standard $20.5 Million).</p>
<p>Sources should identify and address if they are a large, small, 8(a), woman owned, Hub zone, or otherwise classified as a small disadvantaged business in their responses. Small business respondents should provide information on the services they propose. Responses will be reviewed to identify firms capable of fulfilling the Government's requirements. Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary. FLETC does not intend to award a contract on the basis of these sources sought or to otherwise pay for the information solicited. Respondents should not construe this announcement as a commitment by FLETC for any purpose.</p>

Capability Packages (other than the information requested by small business respondents) are NOT requested at this time but will be accepted if submitted.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY - PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., W91278-06-C-0038<br><br>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>Furthermore, the existing contract must be used because:  1) The contractor is already responsible for the complete inspection, maintenance, and repair of this recreation area.  Also, the contractor is already working in the area renovating the entrance to the park and re-aligning a portion of the access road.  2) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared.  The extent of the work and the resources needed cannot be fully determined prior to removing a large culvert that must be replaced and due to the currently ongoing road re-alignment work.  3)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and even during the other ongoing work without a detailed scope of work so as to minimize the time the area is closed thus minimizing the impact on the public.    4)  The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during installation.
