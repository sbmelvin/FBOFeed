<DESC>This is a synopsis which announces the Food and Drug Administration?s intent to issue solicitation FDA-SOL-07-00127 and award a sole-source contract to Mead Walker Consulting1199 Hopewell Road, Downingtown, PA  19335-1206 for the continuous development of Health Level 7 (HL7) Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) Message for federal government public health surveillance activities.  (Numbered Note #22 applies.)  The upcoming contract will be Year 4 of the study/development; further, 33% of the study/development has already been completed.

The services will include further expansion of FDA and CDC?s HL7 Normative Standards for federal government public health surveillance activities.  There will also be data collection and analysis for FDA?s drug and biologic Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS), Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH)?s Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database (MAUDE), FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), and CDC?s National Disease Surveillance System.
 
Additionally, services will require involvement when the DSC AE Workgroup will engage in extensive planning and system development to implement the ICSR message, including a comprehensive FDA implementation guide, which will be used to support the agency?s new consolidated adverse event reporting portal MedWatchPlus

The FDA has worked exclusively with the contractor for past three years to develop the Health Level 7 (HL7) Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) Message.  The contractor has extensive experience with HL7, and is one of two experienced modelers in HL7 that has direct, relevant experience as an HL7 Modeling Facilitator that has successfully developed messages for the HL7 Public Health Reporting Domain.  The contractor has worked extensively over the past four years with FDA and CDC to develop HL7 Normative Standards for federal government public health surveillance activities.  The contractor is uniquely qualified, in that he already has thorough knowledge and experience with both FDA and CDC regulatory and public health surveillance program requirements.  The contractor has developed standards that support data collection and analysis for FDA?s drug and biologic Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS), Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH)?s Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database (MAUDE), FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), and CDC?s National Disease Surveillance System.
 
The contractor understands FDA?s business processes and analysis requirements for adverse event data reported to the agency, and well as other pre-market regulatory submission requirements that support new drug applications and biologics license applications.  Examples include:  Structured Product Labeling, Stability Data and the International Conference on Harmonisation?s (ICH) Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD).  Additionally, the contractor has been facilitating the development of a new HL7 standard, the Regulated Product Submissions (RPS) message, which is designed to support all new FDA regulated product submissions.  The contractor produces excellent work products, as has successfully coordinated HL7 and American National Standards Institute (ANSI) approval of public health standards:  Case Notification (used by CDC for disease surveillance) and ICSR Release 1 (used by FDA CDRH for piloting electronic submission of device adverse events).  Mead?s ability to translate FDA requirements into HL7 modeling language is exceptional, and has contributed to the overall success of our work over the past three years.  The learning curve for a new contractor to understand all FDA adverse event requirements, based upon several FDA data collection systems and forms, international requirements (ICH and Veterinary ICH), and the HL7 modeling, software tools and balloting process is substantial.  
 
The FDA Data Standards Council (DSC) would like to minimize the amount of ballot preparation and review fatigue and resource commitments necessary to orient and train a new contractor.  The DSC AE Workgroup will also be engaged in extensive planning and system development to implement the ICSR message, including a comprehensive FDA implementation guide, which will be used to support the agency?s new consolidated adverse event reporting portal MedWatchPlus.  This concurrent work will greatly reduce the amount of time and assistance that can be devoted to bringing a new contractor up to speed on the standard, and facilitate our goal to consolidate AE reporting formats within the agency.
 
The 2006 contract agreement with the contractor already included data requirements gathering and analysis for the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM),  the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) and the Office of Combination Products (OCP).  These new requirements will be used to develop Release 2 of the ICSR message, which FDA intends to implement for MedWatchPlus.   The contractor?s understanding of how AERS, VAERS, and MAUDE accepts, processes and archives data will contribute greatly to his efforts to migrate CVM, CFSAN and OCP data into the existing model structure (ICSR Release 1), and provide the design basis for release 2.  Given the contractor?s exceptional performance on previous FDA and CDC contracts and experience with HL7, the DSC is confident that the contractor will continue to do an outstanding job, and is better positioned to work more independently to develop the necessary requirements analysis documents, HL7 project descriptions, Refined Message Information Models (RMIMs), data artifacts and ballot materials for successful acceptance and approval of the ICSR Release 2 message.

<DESC>The contractor shall develop an automated CPA system for USTRANSCOM, Command, Control, Communications and Computer Systems Directorate (TCJ6), the CPA program at Scott AFB, IL.  The contractor shall provide business process analysis, software development, documentation, and support.  This contract will allow USTRANSCOM to begin fulfilling its mission to automate for the customs and border clearance process.
The general scope of the contract is to provide functional analysis support, system/software engineering, and software application support required for the development of new functional capabilities and the expansion of existing capabilities currently available on two prototype software applications.  The CPA program goal is to satisfy customs clearance requirements for all DOD shipments around the world with a single Automated Data Processing (ADP) system.  Currently there are two prototype applications operating, one in Germany and one in Korea.  The contractor shall create a single system that has the existing prototypes capabilities, identified requirements, and implementation for each of the 18 countries.  The CPA system shall provide a series of flexible alternatives for creating and transferring customs clearance information for multiple countries.  It shall provide a seamless system for creating, populating and transmitting customs and related shipping documentation, while maintaining continuous visibility of the customs/border clearance process.  Additionally, the CPA system shall provide metrics that will allow USTRANSCOM, regional Combatant Commands, Services and Defense Agencies the means to identify problem areas in documentation, shipment processing and policy guidance.
The end state of the CPA program will provide DOD the capability to provide electronic files in a format agreeable to the individual host nation foreign countries that can be used to identify DOD shipments for customs clearance purposes and will provide the necessary data to allow those shipments duty-free entry as provide for by the specific Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA) for each individual country.  The CPA system shall strive to meet the above goal for the following countries:  Republic of Korea, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, Spain, Bahrain, Kuwait, Canada, Afghanistan, Bosnia/Herzegovina, Diego Garcia, Iceland, Iraq, Netherlands, Turkey, Oman, and Saudi Arabia.  The CPA system shall provided electronic files that will be used to generate customs clearance documentation in an electronic format.  The formats and language shall vary by destination host country to satisfy its requirements.  The system shall push clearance information to US customs clearance officers, foreign customs authorities and commercial and military carriers as required by the operating environment in the host country.  In those cases where shipments arrive in the host country without advance data, the system shall provide the capability to produce customs clearance documentation using data input by the carrier and/or consignee.  For those countries that cannot participate in full automation, the system shall provide the host nation with printed forms as required.  In addition, the system shall provide status, conduct surveillance, and measure performance.

<CONTACT>Sara Oletski Contracting Officer 3032366498     Sara_Oletski@blm.gov;
<DESC>Solicitation Number NAR070046 applies and will be issued as a Request for Proposals for the following services: seeding sagebrush, sagebrush/forb mixes, and sagebrush/forb/grass mixes on approximately 34,890 acres using Government furnished seed. The 10 project locations are located in southern Idaho from southeast of the town of Midvale, Idaho to Glenns Ferry, Idaho. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES: General - The Contractor shall seed an estimated 34,890 acres of designated areas in conformance with these specifications and the Detailed Specifications.  Unless otherwise specified, the Contractor shall furnish at work sites applicator(s) experienced in applying seed in rough, rocky or mountainous terrain, all equipment, labor, supplies, and materials required to complete the job.  The Contractor shall service and repair his/her equipment as necessary to maintain satisfactory progress on work.  Estimated start date is January 27, 2007 and all work will be completed within 17 calendar days. Differentially Corrected Global Positioning System (DGPS) - The Contractor shall be required to utilize a DGPS for electronic Navigation.  System must be capable of utilizing ArcGIS or ARC-INFO shape files created by the government and given to the contractor on a standard HD 1.44 mb, 3.5 inch floppy disk or USB compatible flash memory stick. (1) On the ground flaggers and an auto-flagger system can supplement the DGPS system, but not substitute for it. (2) Differentially Corrected Global Positioning System (DGPS) Navigation - DGPS is required for tracking, and data collection. The Contractor shall provide all guidance equipment, materials, computers, printers, personnel, and services required for the system to be used.  The system shall be sufficiently sensitive to provide immediate deviation indications (real-time).  The DGPS system must be capable of determining a differentially corrected location with an error of no more than one to two meters in the horizontal plane.  The guidance system shall be capable of updating current position at a rate of a minimum of one time per second.  Differential correction must cover the complete operational area.  During operation, differentially corrected signal must be accurately recorded at least 90% of the operational time.  Differential correction may be provided by a portable differential station, FM radio fixed towers, or satellite.  Software provided with DGPS must be designed for parallel offset in increments equal to the assigned swath width of the application equipment. Base of Operations - The Contractor shall provide such landing facilities as may be required for competent performance of contract. The use of any loading area shall be arranged by and at the discretion and risk of the Contractor, and the Government shall not be held responsible for any loss, mishap, or accident due to conditions of any site used.  The Contractor shall provide appropriate warning signs for traffic if roads are used as loading sites. Equipment - The Contractor shall furnish sufficient equipment to satisfactorily seed the designated areas in the time specified as required in the Detailed Specifications.  Equipment shall be capable of traveling at moderate speed and low enough to give proper control and distribution of seed. Communication - The Contractor shall furnish sufficient equipment to have communications with the Government either by using radio frequencies designated by the Project Inspector or by providing a radio to the Project Inspector. Seed Bucket(s) or Hopper(s) - Sagebrush seed presents unique problems due to its bulkiness and its tendency to bridge in the seed bucket.  In addition, it is anticipated that a majority of the sagebrush seed will have a high moisture content which causes seed to compact, clump, and bridge even more severely.  Therefore, seed bucket(s) or hopper(s) shall include a mechanical agitation system to prevent the seed from bridging in the bucket or hopper.  Equipment that cannot perform the specified work shall be modified or replaced by the Contractor.  Equipment shall be equipped for carrying seed with an approved distribution mechanism complete with release, shutoff, and spreading device, which can be calibrated for spreading seed at the prescribed rate in a satisfactory manner and uniform pattern.  Seed bucket(s) or hopper(s) shall include lids, which fasten securely to prevent seed from blowing out. Seeder Calibration - The Contractor shall calibrate seeding equipment prior to application on the project.  The Government will supply seed for calibration.  However, the seed may not be available until approximately two days prior to the approximate start date of the project.  Seed used for calibration shall be recovered for use on the project. Seed - The seed will be furnished by the Government at the location stated in the Detailed Specifications.  Contractor shall load and transport seed from the pickup point to the operational loading sites and shall be responsible for its protection from loss or damage due to weather, rodents, insects, theft, or any other hazard.  Any seed damaged or lost, while in the custody of the Contractor, will be replaced by the Government, and actual cost to the Government for replacement will be deducted from payments due the Contractor.  All unused seed shall be returned to the pickup point by the Contractor or nearer destination, if so directed, upon completion of work or termination of the contract.  All empty seed bags shall be tied in bundles of 25 bags each and returned to the Government by the Contractor. Seeding Operation - Rate of seeding - Seed shall be distributed at the rate stated in the Detailed Specifications, or as directed by the Contracting Officer.  Some seeding rates may be slightly reduced due to availability of seed.  The following is a list of the locations and quantities for the required seeding: Description/Pounds of Seed/Estimated Acres East Ant/800/440 Frenchie/6,320/5,720 Paddy Cake/1,650/805 Cherry High Elevation Mix 1 (strips)/37,500/10,000 Cherry Low Elevation Mix 2/80,340/6,291 Cherry Grass Mix 3/43,150/3,589 Chubby Spain (BLM)/9,980/2,250 Ditto Rest/5,670/2,735 Cold/3,340/1,310 Chubby Spain (TNC)/6,450/1,750 This is a 100% set-aside for small business.

<DESC>TO ALL OFFERORS INTENDING TO PRIME THIS SOLICITATION

On Thu 14 Dec 1400-1700 hrs, the GPS Wing invites you to attend an Industry Day specifically tailored to Organizational Conflict of Interest concerns.  This meeting will be by invitation only, so if you are interested in priming this solicitation, please send the names of up to 4 members only of your team.  We recommend team composition be a legal representative, a contracts representative, a technical representative, and a member from your company's senior leadership.  Reply by sending the names, e-mail, and a cell phone contact that will be reachable that day to joyce.mullenbach@losangeles.af.mil (310-653-1215) by COB Tue 12 Dec.  The meeting will be held on Los Angeles AFB, the specific location will be provided via invitation only.  This is not an open Industry Day and is aimed specifically to those companies intending to prime.

While this meeting will be in open discussion format, we will present the following content to establish the basis for discussions:

- Present new Section I clause on OCI for the SE&I RFP--this new clause should improve our ability to successfully establish effective OCI Mitigation Plans
- Present new SMC OCI Policy Memo from SMC/PK describing new OCI review teams for solicitations to ensure consistency of OCI policy application and help reduce Offeror risk of being barred from future solicitations
- Backup briefing on latest RFP content if time available

In summary of what SMC's OCI policy is for these SE&I solicitations, we provide the below summary statement:

Any contractor, including those who have current GPS systems contracts or who plan to propose on future efforts such as OCX or GPS III, may participate as either a prime contractor or subcontractor in this SE&I procurement.  While the Government believes that participation as a subcontractor creates certain advantages in mitigating organizational conflicts of interest for the systems contractors, it also understands that it is possible for these same contractors to mitigate OCIs with a carefully crafted mitigation plan, but note that firewalls by themselves will not mitigate either a bias or an impaired objectivity type OCI.  Note also that the fact that the Government has approved a mitigation plan does not guarantee that a third party will not challenge either that plan, or its implementation, in a future procurement. The choice to propose as a prime or as a subcontractor is a business decision each contractor must make. All offerors, however, must address the OCI issue. Language substantially similar to the following will be placed in the SE&I solicitation:


1.  The Offeror shall include an OCI Mitigation Plan as applicable in accordance with SMC H-XXX.  The proposed OCI Mitigation Plan shall:

	1.1  Describe in detail any potential OCIs of which the Offeror is aware associated with its or any of its divisions'/affiliates'/subcontractors' performance under any contract it or any of its divisions/affiliates/subcontractors has been or may be awarded by any federal agency whose performance may create an OCI if it is awarded the SE&I contract;
 
     1.2.  Describe in detail the methodology the Offeror used to identify those potential OCI issues;
     
	1.3.  Describe in detail the specific techniques the Offeror intends to use to mitigate each potential OCI identified in its proposed OCI Mitigation Plan;  and

     1.4.  Address all topics listed in the most current version of SMC's OCI Mitigation Plan Checklist (October 2006)(available at http://www.losangeles.af.mil/SMC/PK/PKHOME/PKC/CHKLISTS/ocimitigationplan.doc).  Any mitigation techniques proposed for each potential OCI shall be consistent with FAR Subpart 9.5 and the most recent decisions of the Government Accountability Office and the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.  If no potential OCIs are identified, the Offeror shall so state in which case this Attachment is not required."

DECLARATION: This publication is both, a duplicate of archived Modification 07 to the original synopsis for Solicitation Number FA8807-07-R-0003, and for information only and does not constitute a final Request For Proposal (RFP), government sponsorship of contractor charges against any government contract for proposal efforts, or a government promise to pay for any information received in response to this announcement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<RESPDATE>081106
<CONTACT>Wendy Lopez, Contract Specialist, (973)724-3066
<DESC>The US Army, TACOM-Picatinny Center for Contracting and Commerce, Picatinny, NJ anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the production of  the Setter to Platform Cable Assembly for the Enhanced Portable  Inductive Artillery Fuze Setter (EPIAFS).  The RFP will be for one  production year with options for an additional four production years,  for a total five production years. The EPIAFS Setter to Platform Cable Assembly is part of the EPIAFS system which will be capable of setting  the XM982 Excalibur projectiles and all NATO standard inductive fuzes.  The EPIAFS system consists of three electronic components: A  Platform Integration Kit (PIK), a Handheld Setter,and a Setter to  Platform Cable Assembly.  The Platform Integration Kit (PIK) is a  gun-mounted data processor that sends and manages the data stream  from multiple interfaces. The Handheld Setter is a handheld device  which inductively couples data and power to either the Excalibur  projectile or applicable fuzes.  When the Setter to Platform Cable  Assembly is connected to a Howitzer with an automated Fire Control  System, such as the Light Weight (LW) 155 Towed Howitzer M777A2 or  the M109A6 Paladin Digital Fire Control System, the EPIAFS can receive  and inductively supply a stream of data, power,and timing pulses to  initialize a precision guided GPS projectile such as Excalibur.   Excalibur is a GPS Precision Guided Munition which requires power and Gun, Target, Fuze, and GPS data to be sent over an inductive  interface to initialize the projectile. Funds are available for this acquisition.  These Cable Assemblies will be furnished as Government  Furnished Material to the EPIAFS systems contractor.  The Request for  Proposal which will address a requirement to produce these cable  assemblies will be posted on or about September 6, 2006.  Point of  contact for this requirement is William D. Tenz, AMSTA-AQ-APC,  Bldg. 9, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000. Email:  wtenz@pica.army.mil.  Numbered Note 1 applies to this acquisition.

TO ALL OFFERORS INTENDING TO PRIME THIS SOLICITATION

On Thu 14 Dec 1400-1700 hrs, the GPS Wing invites you to attend an Industry Day specifically tailored to Organizational Conflict of Interest concerns.  This meeting will be by invitation only, so if you are interested in priming this solicitation, please send the names of up to 4 members only of your team.  We recommend team composition be a legal representative, a contracts representative, a technical representative, and a member from your company's senior leadership.  Reply by sending the names, e-mail, and a cell phone contact that will be reachable that day to joyce.mullenbach@losangeles.af.mil (310-653-1215) by COB Tue 12 Dec.  The meeting will be held on Los Angeles AFB, the specific location will be provided via invitation only.  This is not an open Industry Day and is aimed specifically to those companies intending to prime.

While this meeting will be in open discussion format, we will present the following content to establish the basis for discussions:

- Present new Section I clause on OCI for the SE&I RFP--this new clause should improve our ability to successfully establish effective OCI Mitigation Plans
- Present new SMC OCI Policy Memo from SMC/PK describing new OCI review teams for solicitations to ensure consistency of OCI policy application and help reduce Offeror risk of being barred from future solicitations
- Backup briefing on latest RFP content if time available

In summary of what SMC's OCI policy is for these SE&I solicitations, we provide the below summary statement:

Any contractor, including those who have current GPS systems contracts or who plan to propose on future efforts such as OCX or GPS III, may participate as either a prime contractor or subcontractor in this SE&I procurement.  While the Government believes that participation as a subcontractor creates certain advantages in mitigating organizational conflicts of interest for the systems contractors, it also understands that it is possible for these same contractors to mitigate OCIs with a carefully crafted mitigation plan, but note that firewalls by themselves will not mitigate either a bias or an impaired objectivity type OCI.  Note also that the fact that the Government has approved a mitigation plan does not guarantee that a third party will not challenge either that plan, or its implementation, in a future procurement. The choice to propose as a prime or as a subcontractor is a business decision each contractor must make. All offerors, however, must address the OCI issue. Language substantially similar to the following will be placed in the SE&I solicitation:


1.  The Offeror shall include an OCI Mitigation Plan as applicable in accordance with SMC H-XXX.  The proposed OCI Mitigation Plan shall:

	1.1  Describe in detail any potential OCIs of which the Offeror is aware associated with its or any of its divisions'/affiliates'/subcontractors' performance under any contract it or any of its divisions/affiliates/subcontractors has been or may be awarded by any

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541820   The purpose of this amendment to list the questions and answers that have been submitted for this posting: Q1.  Ideally, I feel that the meetings with the members of the Partnership would take place in person.  Is this your expectation?  If so, I am wondering if you  could provide information about where these meetings might take place, so that I may estimate travel costs. A1.  Meetings are likely to take place in Detroit Michigan and Washington DC. Q2.  Regarding Task 2, could you please clarify what the deliverable will entail? -          Are vendors  gathering existing ?Partnership? records/information/etc and creating a list of resources that the Partnership can use?   No, it is for the contractor's information so they can write the partnership history -          Is the purpose of the proposed meetings to produce a synopsis of the  meetings? No, see above -          Is the purpose of the proposed meetings to discover additional sources of information about the Partnership? The purpose is to give the contractor access to partners to ask question, clarify points, and learn more about partners motivations for joining -           Is the purpose of the meetings to conduct research and learn about the Partnership?s history? yes Regarding Task 3 -          Once the required information has been gathered, are vendors expected to design a unique design/format for presenting the findings? Plain MS word document will do.  No  special formatting required. -          Will the findings be distributed to various groups: global automotive trade press, the environmental community, etc? Yes. Regarding Task 4 -          Will vendors developing the copy be required to work within existing design templates? No -          Has the  web site design already been developed? No -          Does content currently exist for the web site? No -          Will the existing content be reused for the new web site? n/a

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. This request is an announcement for information/market research for planning purposes. The synopsis does not constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, invitation for bid nor does its issuance in any way restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.

The 377th Contracting Squadron, Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, is seeking potential sources to provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision and other items and services necessary to perform technical services support for the Space Development and Test Wing at Kirtland AFB, per the attached Performance Work Statement.  Potential offerors should submit, in accordance with section 3 of the attached Performance Work Statement, a Statement of Capability (SOC) that addresses the offeror?s ability to perform these services.  

THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPORSALS (RFP).  Firms responding to this announcement should include company name, cage code, point of contact, address and indicate whether they are a small business, 8(a) concern, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, or women-owned small business.  For the purposes of being considered a small business, the following applies:     NAICS Code 541990, Size Standard $6.5M.     The Government reserves the right to set-aside any subsequent acquisition based upon known sources and/or responses to this synopsis.

SOCs may be submitted by facsimile at 505-846-2150; e-mail: elizabeth.hastings@kirtland.af.mil; or mailed to 377 CONS/LGCA, 2000 Wyoming Blvd., SE, BLDG 20604, Rm B-22, Kirtland AFB, NM 87117-5606, Attention: 2Lt Elizabeth Hastings.  Responses must be received not later than close of business (COB) December 18, 2006.  Identify your response with the corresponding Program Title: Sources Sought: SD Technical Services Support.

***MODIFICATION1: A clarification on the deadline for submitting Statement of Capabilities:  Please disregard the 5 day submittal deadline stated in Section 3.0 of the Performance Work Statement.  The deadline for submitting Statement of Capabilities is COB 18 Dec 2006.

Interested parties have submitted several questions in response to this Sources Sought posting.  These questions are listed and answered below:

1. Will there be Organization Conflict of Interest (OCI) clauses?
This issue shall be addressed before issuance of a formal solicitation per FAR Part 9.504 - (b) Contracting officers should obtain the advice of counsel and the assistance of appropriate technical specialists in evaluating potential conflicts and in developing any necessary solicitation provisions and contract clauses (see 9.506).

2. Is this a set aside only for small business only?
The set aside has not been determined.  The purpose of the sources sought is to establish what businesses are available to fulfill our requirement in its entirety.  Set-aside type shall be determined once all responses to the sources sought notice have been reviewed.

3.   How does this work differ from SRPII / SRP III contracts?
This is not a Sounding Rocket Program contract.  A contractor would not be required to Launch or provide Launch services for this effort.  This is more of a SETA support contract.

4.   Section 2.1 states the contractor shall provide "on base and on test site planning"  does this require the contractor to be located locally and present on Kirtland  AFB or the selected test site during planning operations?  
Yes, contractor would have to be able to provide support for meetings at Kirtland AFB or at Off-site testing locations.  Physical location at Albuquerque, NM is desirable with frequent TDY's to other locations.

5.   Section 2.1.2 Test Support, Would the selected contractor provide the launch vehicle and launch services, or play a supporting role to SD in evaluation and oversight activities for the full spectrum of on-test site support?
No Launch Vehicle or Launch services required.  This will be more of a SETA role with technical advisement to gov't testers. END MODIFICATION1*****

The maintenance listed above is required to support the Department’s mission critical operating environment and its data from harmful attacks and viruses.  The SurfControl software aids in the process of content filtering for unauthorized sites as well as filtering out harmful web content and/or malicious code on the Department of State’s mission critical operating environment.

Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s core firewall infrastructure.<BR><BR>

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH QUESTIONNAIRE FOR REPAIR AND REFURBISHMENT OF C5 TAIL STANDS.  

Dover Air Force Base requires repair and refurbishment of one empennage platform (tail stand) designed to service the tail components of a C-5A aircraft.  The tail stand is a 70-ton (approximate), 70-foot tall, self-propelled lattice structure comprised of square tubing weldments.  The main structural members are four leg columns joined by bolting to structural fixed deck supports.  The structure is arranged to envelop the tail of the aircraft and provide six work levels, all connected by stairs and serviced by a 1000-pound capacity elevator.  The sixth work level provides access to the horizontal stabilizer.  Each work level consists of a fixed deck that houses a set of sliding deck panels that are manually pulled out to close the gap between the edge of the fixed deck and the vertical stabilizer.  The stand is also equipped with a 1000-pound capacity jib crane, a 1000-pound capacity traveling hoist on an I-beam, and four stabilizing jacks. The tail stand is supported by four two-wheel axles: two fixed axles are powered by a hydrostatic drive, and two steered axles are un-powered.  A 107 HP, 2800-RPM gasoline engine provides the power to drive and steer the stand at 2 mph in still air and at a slower speed against 40 mph wind. The nominal working pressure of the hydraulic system is 2000 psi.  When in position around the tail, the elevator, jib crane, and the hoist are powered through an electric cable from the hangar power source.

<DESC>1.0	INTRODUCTION

Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operates interceptor aircraft to detect, deter and mitigate threats to our homeland such as terrorists, acts of terrorism, drug smuggling and other unlawful movement of people, money, and goods across U.S. borders.  CBP wishes to explore the feasibility and practicality of upgrading the avionics and mission systems, initially on its 10 Citation II Lot III jets and potentially the remaining 16 Citation II jets.  The intent of the upgrade is to improve their operational efficiency and effectiveness as well as lower life cycle support costs.  To reduce program costs and enhance equipment availability and support, the avionics and sensor systems should incorporate open architecture and "commercial-off-the-shelf" non-developmental item equipment to the maximum extent possible.  Those systems must be cost effective to operate and fully supportable (parts, technical assistance, etc.) for 20 years beyond the date of acquisition.  They should also be currently in production, operationally viable (demonstrable) and capable of being easily retrofitted with updated configurations. 



2.0	REQUEST

CBP is seeking information on prime contractors who can install and integrate commercially available avionics and sensor systems, including electronic flight instrument displays that are night vision goggle compatible and reduced visual separation minimum (RVSM) compliant.  The sensor suite will include multi-mode radar and electro-optical/ infrared (EO/IR) sensors.  System performance, size, weight, power and cooling requirements and life cycle support will be important considerations for this modernization effort.  The Maximum combined weight for the complete integrated Radar and EO/IR system shall not exceed 370 pounds.  Interested vendors must be capable of demonstrating their avionics and sensor systems as an integrated end product.  



MINIMUM OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS (GENERAL):



2.1	Radar System

AN/APG-66 radar, which are currently installed in the modified noses of CBP Citation Interceptor jets, are integrated with EO/IR sensors and capable of slewing EO/IR tracked targets.  Replacement radar should have comparable system performance, size, weight, power and cooling requirements as that radar.  At a minimum, the radar should provide 120-degree azimuth and elevation coverage with an automatic capability to detect and track air and surface targets.  Radar capabilities should include the following:

	Air-to-air radar detection, tracking and sorting of various size aircraft;
	Air-to-ground radar detection, tracking and sorting of moving vehicles;
	Air-to-sea radar detection, tracking and sorting of various size vessels;
	Air-to-ground high-resolution radar imaging;
       Radar Slave to EO/IR Functionality;
	10 target (minimum) Track While Scan mode; and
	2 target (minimum) Situation Awareness Mode (SAM)

The radar system should include a Built-in-Test (BIT) mode to accomplish failure detection and failure isolation to a Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) without the assistance of radar support equipment at the organization level.  In addition, the BIT mode shall provide the aircrew, via the onboard radar display, and ground maintenance personnel, via a ground accessible display, the capability to determine radar operational readiness.    



2.2	Electro-optical/Infrared Sensor

The EO/IR sensor shall be housed in a 360-degree continuous rotation turret that is capable of performing long-range visual search, surveillance, and tracking from an airborne platform.  It should be capable of performing those functions in the visible light spectrum as well as the mid-wave infrared spectrum.  The EO/IR sensor shall be interfaced with the radar, capable of slaving to tracked radar targets, and providing automatic focus and video tracking in all electro-optical and infrared modes with operator selectable optical focal lengths.  Additional functionality shall include an eye-safe laser range finder for determining the range to a target of interest and a high-power laser pointer for illuminating a target of interest with night vision goggle compatible light.  The EO/IR sensor payload should include:

	A color TV camera;
	A color TV Spotter Scope; 
	An infrared thermal imager with a minimum of three distinct fields of view;
	An infrared laser range finder that is bore sighted with the sensors;
	A laser illuminator (infrared or near infrared desired); and
	EO/IR Slave to Radar Functionality


2.3	Mission Systems Operator Sensor Station

The Mission Systems Operator station should provide mission operators with the ability to control and simultaneously display and record radar and electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensor videos.  System architecture should include displays at the operator station and the cockpit.  Displays shall have the capability to display mapping, navigation and target information.  To allow maximum flexibility, displays should be capable of simultaneous cockpit and sensor station presentations of various airborne and maritime formats. 



2.4	FAA Certification

A Supplemental Type Certificate issued by the FAA is required for all installations, modifications and structural changes affecting the FAA certification of the Citation.  The radar shall radiate in a Federal Government allocated frequency band under the administration of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration

<DESC>The CommunicationsElectronic Life Cycle Management Command (C-E LCMC) Acquisition CenterWashington, on behalf of the Product Manager, Countermine, Project Manager for Close Combat Systems is seeking sources for non-developmental Vehicle Optics Sens or Systems (VOSSs) for Mine Protected Vehicles.  The VOSS is a multi-sensor camera system with powerful zoom, night vision and thermal capabilities that is mounted on a telescoping mast and gyro-stabilized for operations on the move.  The Government is awa re of two sources, FLIR Systems, Inc., Wilsonville, OR and Gyrocam Systems, Inc., Sarasota, FL and is seeking additional sources.  The Government intends to conduct a capability demonstration of systems at a Government test facility located in Aberdeen Pro ving Ground, Maryland during the timeframe of December 2006 through February 2007.  The proposed effort will attempt to demonstrate the effectiveness of VOSS when installed on U.S. Army mine protected vehicle platforms and operated under operational field conditions.  The VOSS shall be capable of demonstrating some or all of the following capabilities in order of importance to the Government: 1) The height varying, continuously azimuthally rotational-capable, cryogenically cooled camera shall be a camera ca pable of continuously rotating about the azimuth axis, while elevating and depressing throughout elevation.  2) This camera shall also be capable of being raised and lowered relative to its transport vehicle by a minimum of 20 feet, and shall be able to do  all of this while its transport vehicle is underway.  3) The camera shall be capable of providing daylight imagery, night vision imagery, and thermal imagery to the user within the transport vehicle via a display panel.  4) All user display and controls o f the camera, display panel, control panel, etc. shall be centrally located in one place within the transport vehicle.  5) The users control panel shall be such that the user can quickly attach it to their leg or have it mounted, either way for normal ope rations, as desired.  6) The camera shall be platform stabilized.  The threshold tilt range shall be a minimum of + 80 degrees to 30 degrees from the horizontal.  The objective tilt range shall be + 270 degrees to 90 degrees from the horizontal (180 degr ees about the upward vertical axis).  7) The camera system shall be capable of achieving a maximum slew rate of 70 degrees per second.  8) The day camera shall be a color camera.  The day camera system in the Wide Field of View (WFOV) will permit the opera tor to recognize personnel targets that are an immediate threat (i.e., with Rocket Propelled Grenade/Rifle) to the host vehicle and its crew that warrant attention/response at a range of 180 meters with a 70% probability under clear, non-turbulent conditio ns, at all illumination levels ranging from 5 lux (twilight) to 50000 lux (clear daylight).  Clear weather is defined as a 7 km visibility day, with a sky-to-ground ratio equaling 3.0.  Non-turbulent conditions are defined as a Cn2 value of 1.0 e-15.  The target is a one or more human adults, with a characteristic dimension of 0.75 meters, clothed in desert daytime Battle Dress Uniform #8 against a sandy gravel road (intrinsic broadband contrast of 16%).  The cycle criteria will be a V50 value of 9.0 cycles .  9) The thermal imager will operate in either of the Medium Wavelength Infrared (MWIR) (3-5 micrometer nominal) or Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) (8-12 micrometer nominal) spectral bands.  The thermal imaging system in the Narrow Field of View (NFOV) will per mit the operator to read a license plate at a range of 75 meters with a 70% probability under clear, non-turbulent conditions. Clear weather is defined as having an atmospheric transmission value of 85% per km, and where transmission as a function of range  is given by Tau(R) = [Tau (1 km)]Range.  Non-turbulent conditions are defined as a Cn2 value of 1.0 e-15.  The target is a single character on a license plate,  with a characteristic dimension of 0.04 meters, and an intrinsic target to background temperature difference (delta temperature) of 3.0 degrees Kelvin.  The cycle criteria is a V50 value of 5.40 cycles.  The required NFOVE, Medium and WFOV will be at leas t 1.05, 2.1 and 20.25 degrees respectively.  All personnel representing the Corporation providing the system for demonstration (hereafter called: Source) at the Government test site will be required to sign a hold harmless waiver form.  Interested Sources are responsible for arranging transportation of their equipment to and from the Governments test facility.

<SUBJECT>65 -- Olympus Duodenoscope
<DESC>It is the intent of this agency to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  Supplies (or services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and/or services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by 1200 hrs. Alaska Standard Time on 28 December 2006 will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Specifications, plans, or drawings relating to the procurement described are incomplete or not available and cannot be furnished by the government. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed.

It has been determined that ordering a duodenoscope other than the one described below would require the purchase of all hardware and accessories associated with the safe and effective operation of the equipment.  Olympus is the manufacturer and sole provider of the Olympus TJF-160 Additionally; this would require extensive training for the GI/MERC personnel.  It is cost effective to order Olympus brand equipment as they are the sole supplier of endoscopic equipment in the GI clinic and all of the components are already compatible.

The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions received after the posting of the solicitation.  The solicitation closing date remains unchanged.  All proposal packages are due no later than 2:00 p.m. est. December 15, 2006.

Question 1:  There are 5 categories (A - E) of architectural/engineering services listed in the solicitation, are you awarding 1 contract per specific service type? 

Answer 1: Yes.  The government anticipates awarding a contract for each of the specific service type

Question 2: Are firms able to proposal on specific service types or do they need to offer all service types listed? 

Answer 2:  An offeror may offer for the categories in which their firms are qualified/interested in.  An offorer does not have to have offer for all categories.

Question 3: Since there are up to 5 contracts being awarded, will the selection committee consider capable small businesses to fill 1 or more of the contracts?

Answer 3:  Yes.  Small business will be considered for any of the 5 categories. However, the procurement is through full and open competition.

Question 4:  I wanted to confirm however if separate contracts are going to be issued for each of the A/E services categories noted.
 
A. Arch. Services, with Engineering Support for Arch. Projects
B. Engineering Services, M/E/P
C. Engineering Services, Struct., Geotech.
D. Landscape Architecture Services, with Civil Engr. Support In-House
E. Engr. Services - Civil, Env., Hazmat
 
Answer 4:  The government anticipates awarding 5 separate contracts.  The government would like for any firm that proposes to do so in the category in which it is best suited.  The government will consider separate proposals from the same firm for more than one category however, awarding five separate contracts is the government?s intent.

Question 5:  What are the limits on the contract for capacity per year and total contract?

Answer 5:  There are none, other than the size of any given task order, $1/2 million

Question 6:  Is it intended that one submittal/contract cover all 5 service areas, or should firms submit on each service area separately?

Answer 6:  Submit on each separately.

Question 7:  What US Forest Service computers/systems do we have to be compatible with?

Answer 7:  This is an evaluation criteria.  Minimum:  MS Windows, Word, Excel, AutoCad 2006;  Prefer in addition:  SpecLink, REVIT, Right N, Right Suite, eQuest 

Question 8:  Are you asking for 24 hour emergency response field capability under the "Environmental" or "HAZMAT" category?

Answer 9:  Yes

Question 10:  Is the QA Plan included in the 100-page limit?

Answer 10:  Yes

Question 11:  Do I understand that a separate Part 1 is to be submitted for each subconsultant or can we blend their quals (projects and resumes,in particular) into our Part 1? If submitted separately, do they count toward the 100 pages?

Answer 11:  Separate Part 1 for each subconsultant, but total of 100 pages per team

Question 12:  Do the "innovative forms and patterns in building design" count in the 100-page limit?

Answer 12:  Yes

Question 13:  What do you mean by "innovative forms"?

Answer 13:   This phrase refers to particularly notable past work done by the offeror, most typically to be illustrated by photographs and/or renderings.  

Question 14:  Do our subcontractors need to register their Reps and Certs online through the CCR also?

Answer 14:  Please refer to the following and see the last statement:

In order to comply with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, all contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be considered for an award of a federal contract.  For information regarding registration, contact the CCR website at www.ccr.gov.

The FAR requires that prospective contractors complete electronic annual representations and certifications in conjunction with their required registration in the CCR database.  These Annual Representations and Certifications are submitted via the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA), a part of the Business Process Network (BPN).  To register in ORCA, you need to have an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record, a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN and your CCR records, and know your DUNS number.  Detailed information regarding ORCA and how to submit records is available on the ORCA website at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help and FAQs.  

Any award that is made, the prime contractor will have to be registered in CCR and ORCA.  It is not required for the subcontractors, however, it is highly recommended

Question 15:   In regard to the Combine Solicitation posted 11/9/06, it is specified thatyou seek landscape architectural services with Civil Engineering Support In-house for this RFQ. We are a small landscape architectural firm without in-house civil engineering support. Can we qualify by teaming up with a
Civil Engineering firm that has registered to receive notification?

Answer 15:  The government will consider proposal for landscape architectural with civil engineering support not in house with a teaming arrangement with a qualified civil engineering firm.  
Question 16:  The statement below implies this solicitation for A/E Services is only open to firms within 60 Miles of Atlanta, Georgia.  Is this truly the case?
 ?f. Location of firm and subcontractors or consultants within the 60 mile radius of Atlanta, Georgia.?

Answer 16:  The statement is an evaluation factor, and does not mean that a firm will be eliminated from consideration if they are outside of the 60 mile radius.

Question 17:  Can a firm propose on only one of the categories of services, or does the response need to address all of the potential services and the categories are only an internal reference?  For example, Engineering Services, Mechanical/Electrical/Plumbing can be done by my firm in-house, can we just propose for this category?
 
Answer 17:   Yes a firm may propose on only one category, on more than one, or on all, depending upon their qualifications as relates to each category.  See answer to question 4 above.

Question 18:    I noticed a firm location is mentioned regarding a 60-mile radius from Atlanta, GA.  Does the prime need to be located within that geographical boundary for consideration?
Answer 18:  Refer to answer 16 above.

Question 19:   The RFQ says that this procurement will be unrestricted and is open to all businesses regardless of size, but then goes on to say that the NAICS code is 541310 (Architectural Services code) with a size standard of $4.5 million in average annual receipts.  Our firm has average annual receipts of around $30 million, so are we eligible for this solicitation based on our average annual receipts?

Answer 19:  The RFQ is unrestricted; it is open to all qualified/interested offeror regardless of size and annual receipts.  Offerors having annual receipts greater than the size standard associated with the NAICS code 541310 may submit their qualifications.

Question 20:  On page 2 of this RFQ, the A-E services being sought under this announcement are listed.  We can fulfill all services except for the geotechnical engineering and hazmat engineering services, which we could provide with sub-consultants, but we would prefer not to have sub-consultants if at all possible so that we are not subject to MBE/WBE/DBE requirements.  Is it possible to submit our qualifications for the services we have available and still be considered for the contract, or do we need to fulfill all of the desired services as listed in the RFQ?

Answer 20:  Yes.  An offeror may submit for only one of the five categories or for all five depending upon qualifications.

Question 21:  If I understand the RFQ correctly, all information that we would like to submit in response to this RFQ must be contained in our SF-330 with a maximum of 100 single sided pages and we are not allowed to submit other materials about our firm.  Please confirm that this is correct.

Question 22:  The solicitation refers to buildings. Is there any more information as to the type or number of buildings that are being considered?  Could a range of the potential building types be provided?  For example, from largest to smallest; a new ranger station to a shelter structure.

<DESC>Amendment 2 to RFQ GSA-TFI-2007-006 clarifies the issued solicitation.  This amendment to the notice is the final intended:

Offers and offer revisions (if any) and due date is now set as 12/14/2006, 4:30 PM by e-mail to Phyllis.Rose@gsa.gov, and with a copy to Jon.Faye@gsa.gov.  See offer submission requirements 52.212-1 below.

NAICS  334119, SIC 7025.

Award of contract under commercial terms and conditions unchanged, intended as FAR a Part 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items buy and as FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items respectively allows.

See Evaluation commercial items 52.212-2 and Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items 52.212-1 attached.  
 
GSA intends acquiring on behalf of its DOD client a quantity of seven (7) of one specific make and model of Excel Meridian Data, Inc. of Carrollton Texas, Meridian SecurStor subsystems, 24SATA-II FC to SATA-II (part number SS24SATA-FCR-512-24-5002) with Dual RAID controller Disk Subsystem.  This system is DCCI validated and is the only know DCCI validated system.  

Offers of systems without DCCI validation will be disqualified.  DCCI validation is the only means the client has to insures the subsystem is useful for its forensic processes as is required by the American Society of Criminal Laboratory Directors (ASCLD) in order for the client to maintain its ASCLD accreditation.  

There were questions from industry and are most generally stated here as:
QUESTION 1)  The products specified are not manufactured by Excel/Meridian Data.  They are manufactured by Infotrend, Inc.  There are many Infotrend resellers.  Can this buy be conducted as an open market competition?
  
ANSWER 1) The overriding Government need is for a DCCI validated implementation.  The Excel/Meridian implementation contains specific software, controller cards, HDDs, and Firmware in their implementation and which are the DCCI validate systems configuration.

QUESTION 2) Why not an American product.  Product not manufactured in the US.  Why doesn t Buy American Act apply to this procurement?

ANSWER 2)  Buy American is important to GSA and we always try to conduct procurements on this basis, however in this instance the overriding DOD requirement for our clients is for a DCCI validated system.  Conversely, if offers are for other DCCI validated systems, of a domestic or foreign products source these all will are evaluated under our stated standardized evaluation criteria.  GSA is conducting this Information Technology (IT) buy on behalf of DOD and there are blanket exceptions for FY 2004 through 2006 by class deviation issued for DOD signed by the Director of Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy under numbers 2004-O0003, 2005-O0004, and 2006-O0010 for DOD to allow IT purchase from foreign sources.  Annual appropriations acts  also address continuation of this exception for DOD and now interim FAR rules established are proposed to adopt this exception on an ongoing basis. 

QUESTION 3)  How much disc capacity is required with each unit delivered?
ANSWER 3)  Offers on this buy must include 8TB of HDD capacity in 2TB increments.

The balance of the technical specification initially provided remains unchanged by this amendment.  Technical and price Evaluation are unchanged except to clarify that the DCCI validation is a part of the Technical Specification Sub-Factor.  

Price Evaluation emphasis: The Government has not changed its position on the Price evaluation sub-factor.  Price remains significantly less important than technical sub -factors.  

The Government intends to issuing one contract under commercial terms and conditions as allowed by FAR part 13.5 and 12, against this combined synopsis and solicitation after evaluating offers found acceptable and to the best value offer.  Contact Phyllis D. Rose as the primary POC.  ONLY contact the alternate POC if the primary is not available on the day of your inquiry.  GSA reserves the right to issue a contract on receipt of final offer s clarifications as a result of this RFQ Amendment without holding meaningful discussions.  

52.212-1  Instructions to Offerors?Commercial Items (Sept 2006) 
(a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard.

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
