<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a contract to Quest Diagnostics Incorporated, 1901 Sulphur Spring Road, Baltimore, Md 21227. A contract shall be issued for a Progesterone Sub-Study. Serum specimens obtained from enrolled women will be assayed for serum progesterone levels. Results will be utilized in a sub-study to evaluate the effects of hormonal phase on the occurrence of local adverse events and immune response. Justification for other than full and open competition is considered due to the fact that Quest operates a national network of clinical testing laboratories. The Quest Baltimore laboratory already performed the progesterone evaluations on serum specimens obtained form women participants in the CDC's Anthrax Vaccination Program (AVP). The AVP study was a pilot observational study with sparse data for some vaccine doses. However, the CDC's human anthrax vaccine clinical trial sub-study will be better suited to evaluate the potential effect of hormonal status on the occurrence of adverse events following anthrax vaccine in women. Using the same clinical laboratory and thus the same laboratory method, will mean the results of serum progesterone levels obtained for both these studies will be readily comparable.<br />Note 22 applies herein.

<DESC><p>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER THE CONTRACTS IDENTIFIED IN THE ATTACHED LIST.
<p>In June 2008, the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) of the U.S. Department of Education awarded contracts to 49 State Education Agencies (SEAs) (all states except NY, LA, and TX plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico). The period of performance was for a base year of 12 months and 4 12-month option periods for the purpose of providing support to ED by National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) State Coordinators. <br /><br />The Department of Education intends to issue a 12-month task order against each of the existing 49 state contracts to assist SEAs in continued long-term improvement of data collection and submission systems and processes. Final regulations published on January 25, 2007 under 72 FR 3698 require SEAs to use the EDFacts system for submission of all data collected by EDFacts beginning with data collected for SY 2008-09.</p>
<p>These task orders aim to facilitate seamless reporting of complete and timely data to ED and the public. This would be accomplished through steps taken to improve data usage and reporting capabilities within the SEA, including but not limited to: expanding guidance available to Local Education Agencies (LEAs) to improve the quality of their data submissions, automating standard EDFacts reporting formats and enhancing linkages between EDFacts reporting tools and the state's longitudinal student data system.</p>

<DESC><p>The Department of Education intends to issue two new contracts to the State Education Agencies (SEAs) for New York and Louisiana to support long term improvement of data collection through EDFacts. Final regulations published on January 25, 2007 under 72 FR 3698 require SEAs to use the EDFacts system for submission of all data collected by EDFacts beginning with data collected for SY 2008-09.
<p>The SEAs possess unique capabilities in the collection of data from the districts and reporting of that data to the U.S. Department of Education as required for EDFacts. This reporting is a responsibility of the SEA. No other source would be able to access the SEAs' EDFacts reporting systems or the data therein, nor have any binding authority over an SEA's internal data coordination processes. Participation in the Partnership System for the data coordination activities will involve a relationship between the SEA EDFacts Coordinator and OPEPD. The EDFacts Coordinator will be responsible for all data coordination activities and data coordination matters concerning the Partnership System.<br /><br />These contracts aim to facilitate seamless reporting of complete and timely data to ED and the public. This would be accomplished through steps taken to improve data usage and reporting capabilities within the SEA, including but not limited to: expanding guidance available to Local Education Agencies (LEAs) to improve the quality of their data submissions, automating standard EDFacts reporting formats and enhancing linkages between EDFacts reporting tools and the state's longitudinal student data system.</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source procurement.  The Government intends to issue a sole source contract for the Gamma Scientific Model 940 Retroreflection Instrument to replace the obsolete existing machine.  The DLA Product Testing Center Philadelphia currently has a Gamma Scientific Model 930B  Retroreflectometer. The replacement instrument must be compatible with the 930B and other pieces that interface with the retroreflection machiine.  This meter has the advanced retro technology that is found in on retroreflectometers consistent with the 940D.  The sole source procedures are being ised because the Gamma Scientific 940D  is second level of required reflectance testing and is the only equipment compatible with the 930D and the other pieces of the interface. Purchasing of anything other the Gamma Scientific equipment would be harmful to the Government in that there would be additional costs to replace other pieces of equipment that interface with the two instruments.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  In accordance with FAR 5.207, all responsible sources may submit information which shall be considered by the agency.  However, this notice is for informational purposes only; this is not a request for competitive proposals.  Issue date is 2 Jul 09.  The point of contact is Deborah Collins, 614-692-1783 or e-mail:  deborah.collins@dla.mil.  The NAICS code is 333314.  The anticipated award date is 20 Jul 09.

L. 111-5, the Government posts this notice of intent to issue a Request for Quote (RFQ).</strong>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, National Ocean Service, Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS), Engineering Division, Chesapeake, VA has a requirement for the purchase of three (3) Digiquartz&reg; Intelligent Transmitters. The equipment is due for delivery on or before August 20, 2009. <strong>This procurement is a TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.</strong> The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334519 with a small business size standard of 500 employees or less. The Federal Supply Class (FSC) is 6660. The government intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order for this requirement utilizing simplified acquisition procedures.</p>
<p>The Request for Quotations is only available on line by downloading from this site. In order to comply with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, ALL CONTRACTORS must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be considered for an award of a Federal contract. For information regarding registration in CCR, contact the CCR website at www.ccr.gov/index.cfm.

Potential offerors may direct all inquiries pertaining to the solicitation in writing to Janie Laferty at Janie.M.Laferty@noaa.gov or faxed to 757-664-3645. Telephone requests will not be honored. This is a Commercial Acquisition and Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 12 apply.</p>
<p><br />Brand Name Justification</p>
<p>&#61656; The Paroscientific Digiquartz&reg; Intelligent Transmitter model 6000-30G is the standard pressure based primary water level measurement sensors used at CO-OPS environmental monitoring stations on the Atlantic coast below the Mason-Dixon Line, the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean, and throughout the Pacific. Implementing different sensors in place of the current sensors will result in additional cost and resources. Also, there will be resulting delay for testing, training, and purchase of support equipment.</p>
<p>&#61656; Under the current CO-OPS operating system any environmental monitoring sensor that has not been previously approved must be subjected to a series of tests to ensure the quality of the data produced by that sensor and the durability of that sensor for the intended use. These tests usually include bench testing using controlled conditions and physical measurement, controlled environmental testing to check a sensor's reliability under different conditions, and long term comparison testing with accepted sensors at multiple real world locations. These tests and the analysis of the resulting data take a large amount of time, money, and resources to conduct.</p>
<p>&#61656; These Paroscientific Digiquartz&reg; Intelligent Transmitter model 6000-30G is tied to a series of data collection software and existing infrastructure and are replacements in kind due to a high consumable rate as a result of where they are positioned on piers, buoys, etc.</p>
<p>&#61656; CO-OPS stations are designed for optimal performance of the Paroscientific Digiquartz&reg; Intelligent Transmitter model 6000-30G. A change of sensor type will result in a need to redesign the existing stations to accommodate the new sensor.</p>
<p>&#61656; CO-OPS cannot risk the possibility of new mounting hardware to be developed and purchased to mount a new sensor.</p>
<p>&#61656; The data collection platforms at CO-OPS stations are programmed to collect data from the Paroscientific Digiquartz&reg; Intelligent Transmitter model 6000-30G. If a new sensor is implemented additional cost for software development will be required.</p>
<p>&#61656; Currently CO-OPS field personal and contractors are trained in the use and maintenance of the Paroscientific Digiquartz&reg; Intelligent Transmitter model 6000-30G. Additional cost will incur from having to train field personal and contractors on the use and maintenance of a new sensor.</p>
<p>&#61656; Using another type of sensor will require the purchase of additional equipment so that the field crews can support multiple sensor types in a given region.</p>
<p>&#61656; CO-OPS also has the ability and necessary equipment to calibrate and repair the Paroscientific Digiquartz&reg; Intelligent Transmitter model 6000-30G. If a new sensor is implemented new equipment for that sensor will need to be purchased and training will be needed for those tasked with this duty. The Paroscientific model 715 LCD Display is being purchased to further support calibration and repair of the existing Paroscientific Digiquartz&reg; Intelligent Transmitters</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The USGS - Coastal & Marine Geology Team's objective of the analysis is to identify acoustic pulses that were detected at the arrays that may have been emitted by the Canadian geophysical vessel Louis S. St. Laurent, working in collaboration with the USGS, and to analyze signals emanating from the Louis S. St. Laurent for received sound pressure and sound exposure levels.
The Government intends to award this requirement noncompetitively IAW FAR 13.106-1(b) (1) to Greeneridge Sciences, Inc., Goleta, California.

<DESC>RECOVERY--The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is soliciting prospective contractors to perform a construction project for Hop Brook Lake Dam Remedial Foundation Grouting, Hop Brook Lake, in the City of Waterbury and the towns of Middlebury and Naugatuck, Connecticut<BR><BR>Hop Brook Lake Dam is located in the City of Waterbury and the towns of Middlebury and Naugatuck, Connecticut. The dam is located on the Hop Brook about 1.4 miles above its confluence with the Naugatuck River. The Corps of Engineers constructed Hop Brook Dam to provide flood protection in the Naugatuck River Watershed in the State of Connecticut. The project is operated as part of a system in conjunction with four other Corps of Engineers flood control reservoirs in the Naugatuck River basin, to reduce flood flows on the Naugatuck and Housatonic Rivers. Construction of the 520 feet long, 97 feet high dam began in December 1965 and was completed in December 1968. <BR><BR>The work of this project involves installing a vertical grout curtain for the dam embankment. The vertical grout curtain will be installed along the same alignment as the foundation cut-off grout curtain that was installed during initial construction. The alignment of the curtain runs from abutment to abutment, and down to the upstream toe in the center, thus forming a V-shape as seen both in plan view and in section view. The curtain consists of three lines; a center line, an upstream line, and a downstream line, with the lines being 5 feet apart. The holes comprising the upstream and downstream lines shall be vertical while the center line shall consist of holes inclined 15% to the south or west along the curtain's alignment. Primary holes shall be 20 feet apart. Holes shall extend from the riprapped upstream dam face down through the riprap and the embankment (0-58 feet thick) and extend an additional 60 feet into the foundation bedrock, a highly fractured and folded schistose gneiss. In order to ease access and perform work on the 2.5:1 riprapped slope, crushed stone shall be placed along the curtain alignment to form an access road. An additional component of this project is the installation of four piezometers, three on the downstream face near the right abutment, and one on the far left abutment.<BR><BR>The government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price contract as a result of this solicitation. This solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis and evaluated using the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) method. The estimated construction cost of this contract is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990 with a size standard of $33,500,000. The Request for Proposal will be issued on or about July 15, 2009. All interested contractors can download the solicitation at the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov). The due date for proposals will be stated in the solicitation. Requests for solicitation documents by telephone, e-mail or fax will not be honored. Instructions for proposal submission and evaluation factors will be provided in the solicitation. All responsible sources may submit a proposal for consideration by the New England District.

<DESC><BR><BR>SCOPE OF WORK<BR>17 May 2009<BR><BR><BR>1.	 LOCATION:  Whittier Narrows Dam, South El Monte, Los Angeles County, California.<BR><BR>2.	 ITEM:  Remote Groundwater Level Monitoring at Whittier Narrows Dam<BR><BR>3.	BACKGROUND AND LOCATION:  <BR><BR>	a.  Whittier Narrows Dam is a flood control embankment located in Southern California approximately 13 miles east of downtown Los Angeles (N34.0213, E118.0703).  As such, the dam is in a highly urbanized area and is readily accessible via major freeways and surface streets.  The earthen embankment dam is founded on deep alluvial deposits and does not have a positive cutoff, therefore seepage under and through the embankment is anticipated in the design.  Water is impounded infrequently in the reservoir only after storm events and is released in a regulated manner to facilitate groundwater recharge within and downstream from the reservoir while minimizing uncontrolled seepage downstream and maintaining a high level of dam safety.  As a part of the design, a series of 50-foot deep, 8-inch diameter relief wells are located at the downstream toe of the dam on a 50 to 100-foot spacing.  Groundwater levels typically vary between 10 and 30-feet below ground surface (bgs) under the central portion of the 3-mile long embankment but may rise as high as 2 feet bgs in the relief wells (the top of a lateral pipe connection to a toe drain from the relief well casing is at a depth of 2-feet).  Because of the relatively coarse, pervious nature of the foundation materials, groundwater under the dam reacts rapidly to reservoir impoundment and in select locations at the downstream toe can be expressed at the ground surface and create surface ponding.  Therefore, groundwater levels are a critical to the operation of the dam when water is being maintained in the reservoir.  At the present time, groundwater levels must be monitored manually by sounding a few of the 141 relief wells during rain events or reservoir impoundment. <BR><BR>	b.  Because of the dams close proximity to a highly urbanized area, the location of the relief wells is easily accessible to both authorized and un-authorized persons.  Therefore, vandalism of structures and equipment is a constant threat.  <BR><BR>	c.  As a part of a currently on-going dam safety assessment for Whittier Narrows Dam, it is anticipated that additional seepage control measures such as gravel drains and berms may be constructed within several years at the downstream toe of at least a portion of the central embankment (between Rosemead Blvd. and the San Gabriel River spillway).  This construction would be in the area of the existing relief wells.<BR>	<BR>	d.  Currently, the Los Angeles District Reservoir Regulation Section maintains web-based data on reservoir levels, inflow and outflow volumes, and precipitation for all dams in the District . (http://www.spl.usace.army.mil/resreg/)  At Whittier Narrows Dam, this data is telemetered via line-of-sight transmission for both the Rio Hondo and San Gabriel River drainages from transmitters at control houses on the top of each end of the embankment.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>4.	PURPOSE OF WORK:  The purpose of remotely monitoring groundwater levels at Whittier Narrows dam is threefold:  <BR><BR>	a.  Prior to construction of any additional seepage control measures, real-time groundwater levels would allow optimum assessment of conditions relating to safe and efficient operation of the dam during storm events.<BR><BR>	b.  Remote sampling of groundwater level data would provide valuable data relating to the response of groundwater levels to reservoir surface elevations.  This data could be useful in optimizing the design of additional seepage control measures.<BR><BR>	c.  After construction of any additional seepage control measures, real-time measurements of groundwater levels at the downstream toe could be used to assess the effectiveness and operation of the system.<BR><BR>5.	SERVICES REQUIRED: <BR>	a.  Install pressure transducers or piezometers to measure groundwater levels at three locations at the downstream toe of the dam.  Existing relief wells may be used for installation or new, cased holes constructed for that purpose.  The locations shall be in the areas as follows:<BR><BR>Area<BR>Designation	Stations within Area	Relief Wells<BR>in Area	Total<BR>Depth<BR>	From	To		<BR>1	56+80		72	t.d. 47.0<BR>		59+00	74	t.d. 49.0<BR>2	65+60		80	t.d. 45.0<BR>			81	t.d. 47.8<BR>			82	t.d. 49.0<BR>		67+65	83	t.d. 48.0<BR>3	81+35		97	t.d. 48.5<BR>			98	t.d. 49.5<BR>			99	t.d. 49.5<BR>		84+45	100	t.d. 48.9<BR><BR>	b.  Install data logger for each pressure transducer capable of data transmission to a remote site (radio, cell phone, GOES, etc.).<BR><BR>	c.  Provide necessary power for each installation (hard wired, solar panel, rechargeable battery, etc.).<BR><BR>	d.  Construct site security for each site (chain link fencing, instrument house, buried equipment enclosure, etc.).<BR><BR>	e.  Provide hardware and software as necessary to access data from remote computers.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>6.	PERIOD OF SERVICE:	The work and services in the time allowed as follows:<BR><BR>Complete installation of hardware:  60 calendar days after written notification of purchase order award.<BR><BR>Successful data transmission and remote download:  90 calendar days after written notification of purchase order award.<BR><BR><BR>7.	ITEMS AND DATA TO BE FURNISHED BY THE GOVERNMENT:  <BR><BR>The Government shall make available to the contractor relevant information from related studies, design memorandums, and other pertinent data available in its files which may contribute to the preparation of the project, including the following:<BR><BR>Relief Well Pumping Test Data Report  Whittier Narrows Dam prepared for USACE Los Angeles by AMEC Geomatrix, Inc., 2009.<BR><BR>A visit to the project site will be arranged, date TBD<BR><BR>8.	OTHER REQUIREMENTS:  The contractor shall prepare a project schedule and coordinate all aspects of the work prior to execution with project manager David Lukesh, USACE Los Angeles District Geotechnical Branch, (213) 452-3595.<BR><BR><BR>9.	PAYMENT FOR WORK AND SERVICES:  The Government will award a Firm Fixed-Price Purchase Order.  The agreed upon awarded price shall constitute full compensation by the Government to the contractor for the work and services performed under this Scope of work.  <BR><BR>

<a href="mailto:michael.goldberg2@us.army.mil">Michael Goldberg</a>
<DESC>The Army Contracting Command, Joint Munitions &Lethality Contracting Center, Joint Armaments Center, on behalf, of the US Army Armament Research Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) is seeking potential sources that are capable of providing an environmentally acceptable technology for removing cast-cured explosive fills from cavity-type munitions such as artillery projectiles, mortar projectiles, bombs, missile warheads, and torpedo warheads during demilitarization operations.  To date, cast-cured explosive fills in munitions items have been based primarily on RDX, ammonium perchlorate (AP), and aluminum (Al) powder in combination with thermosetting plastic binders which are used to permanently polymerize the solid compound material.  Typically, the ingredients for a cast-cured formulation are combined in a vertical mixer, heated to a molten state, cast into a metal munition body, and allowed to harden and cure in a controlled environment for a specific time period.  Once cured, the thermoset explosive is able to absorb considerably more heat and mechanical shock when compared to similar conventional melt-cast or pressed explosives.  Because the thermoset curing process precludes cast-cured explosives from returning to a molten state with the application of heat, conventional munitions demilitarization methods that rely on heat (e.g., autoclave, steamout, hot water washout, etc.) are ineffective explosive filler removal methods. Candidate munitions demilitarization methods with potential for effectiveness in removing cast-cured explosive fillers are apt to be based upon, but not limited to, either physically removing the explosive filler (e.g. augering, high pressure water washout, etc.) or removing the munitions explosive body casing (e.g., acid digestion, waterjet cutting, etc.) to facilitate explosive filler removal.  Cast-cured explosives are one category of explosive filler that is being developed by the military for use in insensitive munitions (IM) with the goal being to minimize the probability of inadvertent munitions initiation and subsequent collateral damage.IM compliant munitions are engineered incorporating design features (e.g., insensitive energetics, warhead venting, thermal protective coatings, etc.) that increase the munitions insensitivity to unplanned shock and heat stimuli without compromising the munitions ability to function as intended.  Threshold IM reactions for passing IM compliance tests as defined by MIL-STD-2105C (Hazard Assessment Tests for Non-Nuclear Munitions) are burning for passing fast cook-off (FCO), slow cook-off (SCO), bullet impact (BI), fragment impact (FI) tests; and explosion for passing sympathetic detonation (SD) and shaped charge jet (SCJ) tests.  Examples of cast-cured explosive fillers that have been loaded into fielded munition items include:  PBXN-103 (Military Specification WS-12800) used in torpedoes Mk46, Mk48, Mk54, Quickstrike underwater mine Mk65; PBXN-105 (Military Specification WS-13122) used in torpedo Mk48; PBXN-106 (Military Specification WS-13522) used in 5/54 caliber projectiles Mk81, Mk82, Mk83, Mk84, Mk86, Mk158, Mk160, Mk179, Phoenix missile AIM-54; PBXN-107 (Military Specification AS-4485) used in HARM missile AGM-88 (B & C), AARGM missile AGM-88E; PBXN-109 (Military Specification MIL-E-82886) used in low-collateral damage bomb 500lb BLU-126/B, general purpose bombs 500lb BLU-111 (/B, A/B, B/B, & C/B), 1000lb BLU-110 (/B, A/B, B/B, & C/B), 1000lb BLU-110 (/B, A/B, B/B, & C/B), 2000lb BLU-117A/B, penetrator bombs 2000lb BLU-109 (A/B & B/B), special purpose bomb 2000lb BLU-116A/B, CrashPAD bomb 2000lb BLU-119/B; PBXN-110 (Military Specification WS-22347) used in MAPAM mortar cartridge 60mm M1061, Standard Missile SM-1 & SM-2; PBXN-111 (Military Specification MIL-E-82902) used in CALCM cruise missile AGM-86C; and AFX-757 (Military Specification MIL-DTL-32103) used in small diameter bomb 250lb GBU-39/B, JASSM missile 2000lb AGM-158, thermobaric penetrator bomb 2000lb BLU-121A/B, and penetrator bomb 5000lb BLU-122/B.

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis   This is not a Notice of Solicitation.     The Walla Walla District is issuing this notice to determine if there are an adequate number of interested business concerns capable of providing the US Army Corps of Engineers with the following purchase requirement.<BR>The US Army Corps of Engineers plans to purchase passive integrated transponder (PIT) (134-136 kHz) tags for the next three years for implantation into juvenile salmonids for research associated with the Northwestern Divisions Anadromous Fish Evaluation Program (AFEP).  A PIT tag is classified as a sonar reading tag under the Standard Industrial Code #3812 and is subject to radio frequency licensing.  The two types of PIT tags needed are a glass-encapsulated tag measuring approximately 12.5 mm long by 2.1 mm in diameter and 8.5 mm long by 2.12 mm in diameter..  The tag can be coded with one of 35 billion unique codes.  This information includes its PIT tag number, tagging location, organization responsible for the tagging, species, run weight, length, wild or hatchery type, marks and general health which are enter into the central database during the tagging event for each fish.  Both outmigrating juvenile salmonids and returning adult salmonids pass through electronic interrogation coils established at numerous detection sites located throughout the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS) and tributaries of the Columbia River Basin.<BR><BR>Each PIT tag must provide the necessary readability, reliability, high performance, and unique code for all FCRPS detection devices in the Columbia River Basin.  Each tag must meet or exceed the FCRPS PIT tag system performance testing and detection efficiency for receiver equipment (134-136 kHz range) and Bonneville Power Administration Corner Collector technology.<BR>Estimated  Quantity Delivery per year:  Note:  These quantities are estimates only.  The intent is set up a Requirements Contract (not under this sources sought) as covered under FAR 16.503.<BR><BR>				8.5mm PIT tag		12.5mm PIT tag<BR><BR>Base Year 			200,000 each			2,600,000 each<BR><BR>Option Year 1 			225,000 each			2,030,000 each.<BR><BR>Option Year 2 			250,000 each			2,020,000.each<BR><BR><BR>The supplier must be able to produce and provide large quantities of PIT tags, sometimes within in a short time period of two to three weeks, in order to meet delivery dates driven by the timing of out-migrating juvenile salmonids and research activities.  PIT tag delivery requirements of up to 500,000 12.5mmPIT tags or 50,000 8.5mmPIT tags within two weeks may be required.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) VA-101-09-RI-0203 ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY FOR PURPOSES OF CONDUCTING MARKET RESEARCH.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUEST FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.BackgroundThe Department of Veterans Affairs Central Office, (VACO), Veterans Healthcare Administration (VHA), in collaborations with the Department of Defense (DoD) and other leading professional organizations, has been developing clinical practice guidelines since the early 1990s.  Guidelines for the Rehabilitation of Stroke Amputation and the Care Guide for Ischemic Heart Disease were among the first distributed throughout VHA in 1996 and 1997.  Since that time, numerous other, including guidelines on Diabetes Mellitus, COPD, Major Depressive Disorder, Psychoses, Tobacco Use Cessation, Hypertension, Post Operative Pain Management, Substance Abuse, and more, have been developed and distributed for implementation throughout the system.  As a result, the purpose is to establish and operate a contracted system to assist the Office of Quality and Performance and Patient Care Services as well as the Chief, Quality Management Division, USAMEDCOM and DoD develop evidence-based clinical practice guidelines.RequirementsVHA currently contract with an external organization which provides analytic and education support for the development and revision of clinical practice guidelines.  In order to prepare a comprehensive Request for Proposal for a new contract beginning January 2010, VHA is issuing this Request for Information.  The goal of this Request for Information process is to solicit Capability Statements that VHA will use to assist in defining its acquisition strategy and identify sources able to provide the development and revision concerning clinical practice guidelines.VHA requires a potential vendor that can provide analytic and education support for the development and revision of clinical practice guidelines (CPG); as well as associated patient and provider tools, and metrics to facilitate guideline implementation.  For each CPG, the vendor will orient/train Champions regarding the evidence-based approach and process, and assist the identified experts in defining the scope, objectives, timeline, and production schedule; ensuring that all appropriate clinical specialties are involved with the initiative.Interested vendors may submit their capabilities and qualifications to provide the identified services via email to Priscilla Lee at Priscilla.Lee@va.gov no later than 2:00 PM EST, July 10, 2009.  Vendors are asked to provide three relevant past performance references for the capabilities identified.  Include the Project title, Description of the project, Contract number, Contract amount, Government Agency/Organization and Point of Contact name, phone number, and email address.  If the interested vendor holds a current GSA contract, please identify Schedule and Contract number.  Telephone inquiries will NOT be accepted.  In addition to the provision of Capabilities Statements, an Industry Day(s) will be held to provide interested vendors a forum to expand on their capabilities in a direct conversation with Government officials.  All vendors interested in participating in Industry Day shall respond before July 14, 2009, and contact Jacqueline Bartley at Jacqueline.Bartley@va.gov to schedule an appointment.  Industry Day will be held on July 22, 2009.  It is anticipated that each appointment will be 45 minutes to an hour in length and will be held at a VA facility in the Washington DC Metropolitan Area.  All correspondence shall be sent via email to both Priscilla Lee and Jacqueline Bartley and shall reference the RFI number and title in the subject line.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Roman L. Hruska U.S. Meat Animal Research Center, Clay Center, NE, intends to enter into a single source contract with Sequenom, San Diego, CA for the purchase of a used MassARRAY COMPACT SYSTEM with server, MassARRAY LT Nanodispenser Samsung along with liquid handling systems necessary for hME chemistry assays. We need this instrumentation to continue our research in livestock genomics and develop genetic marker systems for the livestock industry. The MassARRAY SNP assay system was developed by Sequenom, Inc. and a fully integrated set of instruments necessary to utilize this technology can only be purchased through Sequenom. The MassARRAY technology is particularly well suited for rapid and economical SNP marker development. The initial cost to develop new assays is minimal while allowing efficient multiplexing of assays and easily regrouping assays to customize assay groups for specific animal populations. In addition, this technology is quite robust, yields extremely accurate data and is the preferred technology for data collection on 50-300 SNP markers across 100-2,000 animals. Sequenom is the sole supplier of the MassARRAY genotyping systems and there are no independent vendors that provide viable alternatives.  Other interested parties may submit questions and/or qualifications statements by Close of Business July 14, 2009.

<p>The Bureau of the Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than ten days after publication of this notice. Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the requirement, at terms more advantageous to the Government than direct purchase through Waste Management. A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response. If no affirmative written response is received, that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements, and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to Waste Management. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Responses to this request must be submitted no later than 2:00 p.m. ET on July 14, 2009 and may be submitted electronically to PSB2@bpd.treas.gov to the attention of Angala Zoller.</p>
<p>No other information regarding this Special Notice will be provided at this time. <br />This notice does not restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. All contractors responding to this spsecial notice are advised that the response is not a request that will be considered for contract award. All interest parties will be required to respond to any resultant solicitation separately from their response to this sources sought notice.</p>
<p>Interested offerors may register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive notification when the solicitation and any amendments are issued and available for downloading. Please note that the General Services Administration provides the notification service as a convenience and does not guarantee that notifications will be received by all persons on the mailing list. Therefore, we recommend that you monitor the FedBizOpps site for all information relevant to desired acquisitions.</p>

The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is hosting a workshop to discuss innovative research to enable revolutionary advances for the rapid development and demonstration of lightweight, high-performance multi-material rotors  for current and future US Navy Submarine applications.  The ultimate goal is to develop and demonstrate multi-physics performance prediction tools and multi-material manufacturing processes that can be successfully transitioned to the US Navy to improve performance and reduce weight and development costs of current and next-generation submarine rotors.  A large percentage of the acquisition cost of legacy US Navy submarine rotors is associated with non-recurring design, analysis, test, and evaluation iterations required to demonstrate the rotors performance.  These rotors are designed to simultaneously address multiple demanding maritime operational environment requirements using proprietary, uncoupled special-purpose domain codes (e.g., structural and hydrodynamic codes).  The current uncoupled nature of these legacy tool-sets is considered to be an impediment to shortening the rotor design cycle due to their inability to rapidly and accurately predict rotor off-design  performance (e.g., during standard maneuvers, crash-back, backing, and crash-ahead operations).  

Legacy US Navy submarine rotors are manufactured from Nickel-Aluminum-Bronze (NAB).  Although NAB material properties are well-understood, the dynamic performance and weight of NAB rotors are dictated by the rotor geometry.  Tailored multi-material (both organic and inorganic) systems offer the opportunity to provide improved dynamic performance and weight reduction unachievable with NAB.  However, transformational improvements in rotor design, analysis, and multi-material manufacturing methods are needed to exploit the potential benefits of multi-material rotors.  

The Hybrid Multi-Materials Rotor Workshop will be held at the Liberty Conference Center, 4075 Wilson Blvd, Suite 300, Arlington, VA, 22201. There is no registration fee.  Details on the workshop, including registration and clearance submission information, can be found at the following URL: www.sa-meetings.com/HMMR2009.  The password for login is: Submarines.

Registration is limited by the venue capacity (maximum of 100 people, maximum 2 from each institution).  The registration cutoff date is July 14, 2009, or at attendance capacity, whichever comes first.  If there is additional space available after the registration deadline, institutions will be permitted to add participants on a first-come, first-serve basis. 

Further questions about the workshop should be directed to DARPA-SN-09-47@darpa.mil.  Please refer to the HMMR Workshop in any correspondence.  

This announcement is not a request for proposals; any so sent will be returned. Nor does this announcement guarantee any funding should a Broad Agency Announcement be published related to these workshops.

The mixed mode allows for a scan resolution of 1-5 nm at a speed of 10 ms per pixel, whereas the pipette scanning mode allow for simultaneous scanning and whole-cell electrophysiology recordings.  

IonScope Limited is the only company which provides such a high spatial and time resolution for the scanning ion conductance microscope in the world.  

The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 13 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

4.7.2.6 Procedures for Pre-Screening Applicants and Investigations

Contractors Responsibility - The Contractor must determine whether the conduct of the person being considered for assignment on this contract indicates a potential for behavior which would interfere with, prevent, or otherwise impact adversely on:  1) the position to be filled by applicant; 2) the performance of the duties and responsibilities of others on the BPA or in the Government; or 3) the ability of the employing agency to effectively carry out its mandated responsibilities.  If the Contractor determines that employing an applicant will not promote the efficiency of this BPA, the applicant must be disqualified from assignment on the BPA.   In this regard, the Contractor shall be responsible for performing the following pre-screening and investigative duties for all persons proposed for work under this BPA:

(a) Furnish to each proposed Contractor employee the forms described in Section 5 and ensure that adequate instructions for completing the forms are provided to each applicant. 

(b) Ensure that applicants obtain two (2) complete sets of their fingerprints on the prescribed Form FD-258 from an organization qualified to take fingerprints.

(c) Collect completed forms from each applicant and review all forms for completeness and correctness.  Return any incomplete or incorrect form(s) to applicant(s) to be corrected and re-submitted.

(d) Submit completed forms to the COTR by no later than seven (7) calendar days after receipt of the blank forms.

4.7.2.7 Contractor Status under the National Industrial Security Program (NISP)

Companies participating in the National Security Program (NISP) are required the meet certain federal standards for the investigation of facilities and employees.  If the Contractor is a registered in the NISP, investigation initiated by the Department may not be required.  The COTR should determine if the Contractor is registered in the NISP, then the facility clearance level held by the Contractor, and if individuals selected to work for the Department were previously investigated in accordance with NISP procedures.  If an individual selected to work for the Department was previously investigated within the last 12 months, the COTR will obtain a copy of the Letter of Consent (LOC) issued by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO). 

4.7.2.8 Factors for Suitability Determinations.  The Department of Justice uses several basic factors in making suitability determinations for contract employees.  This information is intended as a guide for the Contractor during their screening process and is not inclusive of all disqualifying situations.

Disqualifying Factors   The following conduct factors, as disclosed on the SF-85P and the SF-85P-S, in a written statement or personal interview with the applicant, or established during a reference check may disqualify an applicant from employment on a DOJ contract.  Contractors should be aware such individuals may not be able to work for the Department under the BPA.

Criminal Behavior (e.g., a conviction resulting from a serious felony -- murder, rape, armed robbery, etc. -- regardless of when the conviction occurred; a felony conviction, notwithstanding the severity of the crime, within the previous seven (7) years; a period of incarceration as a result of a felony conviction within the previous seven (7) years; or pending indictments or criminal charges)

Infamous or disgraceful conduct (e.g., sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted, or bizarre behavior indicating depravity)

Improper or illegal involvement with drugs within the past 7 years.

Current and continuing alcohol abuse

Intentional false statement, deception, fraud in appointment (e.g., altering the condition of discharge on military discharge documents, altering college transcripts, falsely completing the SF-85P or SF-85P-S, etc.)

Financial considerations (e.g., deceptive or illegal financial practices; continuing inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; financial problems linked to such dependencies on alcohol, drugs, gambling, etc.)

Non-U.S. Citizenship (e.g. non-legal residents; recent legal residents, residing in the U.S. less than four years; non-U.S. citizens maintaining citizenship in "hostile" countries)

Questionable Allegiance to the United States (e.g., membership in organizations or association with individuals advocating violence or overthrow of the U.S. government or involvement in any act of sabotage, espionage, treason, terrorism, or sedition)

Emotional, mental, and personality disorders (when a credentialed mental health professional acceptable to the government has determined that the individual has a condition or treatment that may indicate a defect in judgment, reliability or stability or could physically harm him/herself or others)

Previous security violations (e.g., unauthorized disclosure of classified information or deliberate or multiple violations)

Misuse of information technology systems (e.g. illegal or unauthorized entry into or illegal, unauthorized, or improper use of an information technology system) 

Foreign Influence (e.g. when an individuals immediate family, including co-habitants and other who the individual is bound by close ties or affection, is not a U.S. citizen and may be subject to coercion and/or duress)

Foreign Preference (e.g. and individuals behavior indicates a preference for a foreign country over the United States)

4.7.2.9 Mitigating Factors When questionable conduct is disclosed, the following factors should be considered as to whether or not disqualification of an individual for work in the Department is warranted.  The decision is made on a case-by-case basis, and is subject to review by the assigned Security Officer, in consultation with the COTR.

(a) The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct.

	(b) The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation.

	(c) The frequency and recency of the conduct.

	(d) The individuals age and maturity at the time of the conduct.

	(e) The voluntaries of participation.

(f) The presence or absence of rehabilitation, resolution, and other pertinent behavioral 
     changes.

	(g) The motivation for the conduct.

	(h) The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress.

	(i) The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.

4.7.2.10 Given the above guidelines for determining suitability, the Contractor should be able to determine, without DOJ involvement, which applicants are unsuitable for employment under this contract.  However, additional questions and requests for information may result from review of the security packages by DOJ personnel.  In the event the Department or the contractor has reasonable cause to believe that an employee under the BPA falls under any of the eleven mandatory disqualification factors listed above, the employee must be removed from this BPA.  In addition, all contract employees are expected to adhere to the Department's Standards of Conduct.

4.7.2.11 The COTR will notify the Contractor of the results of background investigations as they are completed and adjudicated.  The COTR will also notify the Contractor of any applicants who are found ineligible for employment under this contract so that the Contractor can immediately recruit and initiate paperwork to clear replacement applicants.  If a contract employee is already working on the BPA and is determined to be ineligible, he or she will be removed from the call order.

4.7.212 The COTR will notify the Contracting Officer when a sufficient number of Contractor employees have received employment security approvals or pre-appointment waivers approvals.  Upon receipt of this information and any other information, which may be required elsewhere in the BPA, the Contracting Officer will issue the Contractor a Notice to Proceed, which permits the commencement of work under the call(s).

4.7.2.13 The Contractor shall ensure no contract or subcontract employee commences performance hereunder prior to receipt of a written authorization from the Contracting Officer.

4.7.2.14 The Contractor shall make every effort to preclude incurrence of costs by the Government for security investigations for replacement of employees, and in so doing shall ensure otherwise satisfactory and physically able employees assigned hereunder remain in contract performance for at least one year.  The Contractor shall take all necessary steps to assure contract or subcontract personnel selected for assignment to this contract are professionally qualified and personally reliable, of reputable background and sound character, and meet all other requirements stipulated herein.  The fact the Government performs security investigations shall not in any manner relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to ensure that all personnel furnished are reliable and of reputable background and sound character.  Should a security investigation conducted by the Government render ineligible a Contractor-furnished employee, the Contracting Officer will investigate the cause and determine whether the Contractor has abdicated his responsibility to make every effort to select reliable employees of reputable background and sound character.  Should there be a need to replace a contract or subcontract employee due to non-performance, the Contracting Officer will determine whether the Contractor has abdicated his responsibilities to make every effort to select trained and experienced employees.

4.7.2.15  Should the Contracting Officer determine the Contractor has failed to comply with the terms of paragraph above, the Contractor may be held monetarily responsible, at a minimum, for all reasonable and necessary costs incurred by the Government to (a) provide coverage (performance) through assignment of individuals employed by the Government or third parties in those cases where absence of contract personnel would cause either a security threat or DOJ program disruption, and (b) conduct security investigations in excess of those which would otherwise be required.  

4.7.2.16 Nothing in this clause shall require the Contractor to bear costs involved in the conduct of security investigations for replacement of an employee who becomes deceased or severely ill for a long period of time.

4.7.2.17 Under no circumstances shall the Contractor fail to comply with the terms and conditions set forth herein without assuming liability for such failure as may be established pursuant to this clause.  The rights and remedies conferred upon the Government by this clause are in addition to all and other rights and remedies specified elsewhere in this contract or established by law.

4.7.3	Protection of Grand Jury Information

4.7.3.1 Grand jury testimony is sensitive Limited Official Use information, which must be protected against disclosure to unauthorized personnel.  Pursuant to Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedures, disclosures of matters occurring before the grand jury other than its deliberations and the vote of any juror may be made available to the attorneys for the Government to use in the performance of their duties.  Otherwise a juror, attorney, interpreter, stenographer, or operator of a recorded testimony may disclose matters occurring before the grand jury only when so directed by the court.

4.7.3.2 It shall be the duty of the Official Reporter to safeguard all materials relating to grand jury hearings, which are in his/her possession and/or under his/her custody.

4.7.4	Contractor Physical Security Requirements

4.7.4.1 Contractor employees assigned to work areas where Grand Jury information is processed, stored, or transcribed must challenge the presence of any unknown or unauthorized person.  The need-to-know principle shall be adhered to at all times within the closed area.  When the materials are not stored in security containers or vaults, and when in actual use by authorized personnel, they shall be protected as follows:
o	Kept under constant surveillance by an authorized person who is in a physical position to exercise direct security controls over the material. 
o	Covered, turned face down, placed in storage containers, or otherwise protected when unauthorized persons are present. 
o	The room containing the materials must be locked when vacated for short periods of time. 
o	Returned to storage containers as soon as practicable after use. Grand jury material shall not be removed from the premises of the court reporter for transcription except for delivery to the USAOs. Approved storage containers include: the GSA Class 6 security container; a lock-bar file cabinet (with a GSA approved lock); or 3-position dial safe. 

4.7.4.2 An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) must be installed connected to a central station at the Contractors facility or the facility of a subcontractor who monitor the IDS and guard or law enforcement response to the Grand Jury processing area must occur within 15 minutes of alarm activation.

(Such system shall not use shunt switches to shut off control panels and all alarm sensors and control boxes should be equipped with tamper-proof switches).  A direct-connect or remote station alarm system (i.e., a system connected by direct wire to alarm receiving equipment located in a local police department headquarters, which is activated and deactivated by the using Contractor and responded to by personnel of the local police department) may be utilized.  If the contracting firm is housed in a building with a 24 hour guard service, the IDS requirement may be waived. The representative of the Contractor shall be required to report immediately to the facility to ascertain the nature of the alarm and to take appropriate measures to ensure the security of area concerned. 

4.7.4.3   End-of-day security checks shall be performed within the contract facility to ensure that precautions are taken to protect grand jury material.

4.7.4.4   The Contracting Officer or his/her authorized representative, of the USAO, shall have the right to inspect at reasonable intervals, but at least annually, the procedures, equipment, and facilities used by the Contractor to comply with these requirements.

4.7.4.5   If the contractor is unable to provide the required physical security in his/her workplace, a work area and storage space for Grand Jury transcript processing will be provided at the USAO.

4.7.5   Information Technology

4.7.5.1 Information Technology Equipment refers to computers, steno machines, transcription devices, printers, scanners, and all other technological devices used to electronically process grand jury information for the USAO.

4.7.5.2   When grand jury court reporters process grand jury information outside the USAO while utilizing Information Technology equipment that is not the property of the USAO, the equipment will be used in a dedicated, stand-alone, single user mode (no network capability). The information must be unclassified. All processing must be done on removable storage media (floppy disks, CDs, removable hard drives, cartridges). Removable storage media must be marked "Grand Jury Information." When marking the media, no acronyms should be used. 

4.7.5.3 In addition, any Information Technology equipment used to process USAO information may be subject to certification/accreditation and/or disk-based sanitization to protect grand jury information. As a general rule, grand jury court reporters may not use personally-owned PCs and equipment to process grand jury information. Personally-owned PCs and equipment are those devices the grand jury court reporter uses to conduct personal projects related to obligations, affairs, assets, or life of the operator.

4.7.5.4 When grand jury court reporter owned PCs are used, and/or have fixed hard drives, and the PC is also used for transcription work outside of the USAO, the equipment must have the ability to download to USAO equipment or storage media.

4.7.5.7 All printed output material must be protected. USAO personnel must ensure this requirement is adhered to and documented in the Grand Jury Inspection Reports. 

4.7.5.8 Only appropriately-cleared maintenance personnel escorted and monitored by USAO personnel or court reporter service personnel are allowed to perform on-site maintenance for the equipment. The USAO must grant approval before maintenance of the PC is allowed. The storage media must be removed from the PC prior to removal of the PC from the area for maintenance. 

4.7.5.9 Grand jury information should be backed up on a weekly basis. Grand jury information may not be processed by individuals outside of those contracted and granted security approval.

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Governments reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 
(2) 
(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business days written notification of its intention to:
(A) Change the name in the CCR database; 
(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;

(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. 
The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractors CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

1.2 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

The Department of Justice may award multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) resulting from this Request for Quotation.  A Contractor may be eliminated based on its prices, in comparison to other Contractors prices.  The Government may also eliminate a Contractor based on Contractors past performance history and failure to provide documentation necessary to verify the acceptability of their court reporters.  A Contractor shall provide the additional information listed below:  

1.2.1	Qualifications of Proposed Staff  The Government reserves the right to request at any time the professional qualifications of Contractor personnel.  This information will be used to ascertain the depth of relevant requisite training, skills and professional certification of personnel.  

1.2.2	Past Performance  Provide (3) references for commensurate projects that are in progress or were completed within the last three (3) years.  If a Contractor will be using a subcontractor, three (3) references must be provided for the subcontractor as well.  References may be from commercial and federal/state Government contracts; however, similar support services performed for Federal Government customers generally will be considered more relevant than those done for commercial or state government customers.  The following information is required for each reference:

o	Customer name and address.
o	Point of contact (name, title, telephone number, and fax number) for contractual/administrative matters (e.g., Contracting Officer) and technical performance (e.g., Contracting Officers Technical Representative).
o	Contract/Task Order number.

E.2 Evaluation Criteria

DOJ may award up to two (2) awards as a result of this solicitation.  

E.2.1 Evaluation criteria:
The Government will evaluate prospective contractors past performance and price in making an award decision.

3.1.1	Past Performance -- Past Performance is a measure of the degree to which a Contractor, as an organization, has satisfied its customers.  The EOUSA will           check each contractors client references to inquire about (1) the quality and timeliness of the vendors work; (2) reasonableness of its business behavior; and, (3) technical and management capabilities.  The EOUSA will attempt to check the references provided by the contractor, particularly commensurate tasks, and may expand the evaluation to include references not contained in the vendors submission.  The actual number of references checked is entirely at the EOUSAs discretion.

3.1.2   Price - The Government intends to make BPA/contract award(s) to the offerors whose proposal represents the best value to the Government. The evaluation of price will be based on the Government estimate of quantities and the offerors total price.  If the Government determines that there are significant differences in technical merit among competing proposals, then a more expensive proposal may be selected for award where the Government determines that the value of the selected proposal is worth the price differential.

Each vendors price proposal will be evaluated to assess the reasonableness of proposed prices. This evaluation will be based on the information and supporting data provided in the proposal and its compatibility with the evaluation factors identified above. 

In making this determination, the Government is more concern with obtaining performance capability superiority rather than overall price.

ATTACHMENTS 

D.1 CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEE RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT

This requirement can be waived for short-term (i.e., those employees performing duties for a cumulative total of 14 days or less) if there is a critical need for their specialized or unique skills (for example, interpreters for rare foreign languages).  These individuals must be United States citizens or Permanent Resident Aliens.  A waiver request from the head of the Component outlining the extenuating circumstances along with the requisite Contractor clearance package shall be submitted through the Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) to the Department Security Officer (DSO) for approval.

D. 3 Continuing Contract Performance During a Pandemic Influenza or other National 
         Emergency 


Continuing Contract Performance During a Pandemic Influenza
or other National Emergency

During a Pandemic or other emergency we understand that our contractor workforce will experience the same high levels of absenteeism as our federal employees. Although the Excusable Delays and Termination for Default clauses used in government contracts list epidemics and quarantine restrictions among the reasons to excuse delays in contract performance, we expect our contractors to make a reasonable effort to keep performance at an acceptable level during emergency periods. 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has provided guidance to federal managers and employees on the kinds of actions to be taken to ensure the continuity of operations during emergency periods. This guidance is also applicable to our contract workforce. Contractors are expected to have reasonable policies in place for continuing work performance, particularly those performing mission critical services, during a pandemic influenza or other emergency situation. 

The types of actions a federal contractor should reasonably take to help ensure performance are: 

	Encourage employees to get inoculations or follow other preventive measures as advised by the public health service. 

	Contractors should cross-train workers as backup for all positions performing critical services. This is particularly important for work such as guard services where telework is not an option. 

	Implement telework to the greatest extent possible in the workgroup so systems are in place to support successful remote work in an emergency. 

	Communicate expectations to all employees regarding their roles and responsibilities in relation to remote work in the event of a pandemic health crisis or other emergency. 

	Establish communication processes to notify employees of activation of this plan. 

	Integrate pandemic health crisis response expectations into telework agreements. 

	With the employee, assess requirements for working at home (supplies and equipment needed for an extended telework period). Contract Security requirements must be considered in making equipment choices; agencies or contractors may wish to avoid use of employees' personal computers and provide them with PCs or laptops as appropriate. 

	Determine how all employees who may telework will communicate with one another and with management to accomplish work. 

	Practice telework regularly to ensure effectiveness.


	Make it clear that in emergency situations, employees must perform all duties assigned by management, even if they are outside usual or customary duties. 

	Identify how time and attendance will be maintained. 

It is the contractor's responsibility to advise the government contracting officer or COTR if they anticipate not being able to perform and to work with the Department to fill gaps as necessary. This means direct communication with the contracting officer, COTR or in his/her absence, another responsible person in the contracting office via telephone or email messages acknowledging the contractors notification. The incumbent contractor is responsible for assisting the Department in estimating the adverse impacts of nonperformance and to work diligently with the Department to develop a strategy for maintaining the continuity of operations. 

The Department does reserve the right in such emergency situations to use federal employees, employees of other agencies, contract support from other existing contractors, or to enter into new contracts for critical support services. Any new contracting efforts would be acquired following the guidance in the Office of federal Procurement Policy issuance "Emergency Acquisitions", May, 2007 and Subpart 18.2 Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. <br />The solicitation number is 1146794 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ.) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-33. <br />The National Institute on Drug Abuse on behalf of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) has a requirement for identification of scientific/peer reviewers and the preparation of summary statements. These applications were received in response to OD-09-004 and OD_09-005, to implement the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The period of performance will be on or about July 10, 2009 - September 30, 2010. The contractor will read the RFA, identify the areas of expertise needed for the review, identify the reviewers (typically up to 6 per meeting), recruit the reviewers (letters, emails, telephone followup), finalize the summary statements from the reviewers and discuss any issues or concerns with the summary statements in order to finalize them. The anticipated level of effort is 340 hours. The Government anticipates 14-17 meetings and up to 250 summary statements. Deliverables include a report to be sent to the Government Project Officer every 2 weeks. The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition.
<p>Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items states the specific evaluation criteria (technical most important) 1) demonstrated ability to recruit reviewers for scientific topics; 2) ability to prepare, edit and finalize summary statements, 3) experience with government grants and the review process and 4) past performance (up to 3 projects of similar scope and size.) Offeror's prices will be evaluated on a best value basis.</p>
<p>Offerors are advised to include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, with its offer.</p>
<p>The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>Funding for this requirement may be appropriated funds or American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The below Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Clause may become applicable.</p>
<p>FAR 52.204-11 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act-Reporting Requirements. <br />As prescribed in 4.1502, insert the following clause: <br />AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT-REPORTING REQUIREMENTS (MAR 2009) <br />(a) Definitions. As used in this clause- <br />"Contract", as defined in FAR 2.101, means a mutually binding legal relationship obligating the seller to furnish the supplies or services (including construction) and the buyer to pay for them. It includes all types of commitments that obligate the Government to an expenditure of appropriated funds and that, except as otherwise authorized, are in writing. In addition to bilateral instruments, contracts include (but are not limited to) awards and notices of awards; job orders or task letters issued under basic ordering agreements; letter contracts; orders, such as purchase orders, under which the contract becomes effective by written acceptance or performance; and bilateral contract modifications. Contracts do not include grants and cooperative agreements covered by 31 U.S.C. 6301, et seq. For discussion of various types of contracts, see FAR Part 16. <br />"First-tier subcontract" means a subcontract awarded directly by a Federal Government prime contractor whose contract is funded by the Recovery Act. <br />"Jobs created" means an estimate of those new positions created and filled, or previously existing unfilled positions that are filled, as a result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as "full-time equivalent" (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor. For instance, two full-time employees and one part-time employee working half days would be reported as 2.5 FTE in each calendar quarter. <br />"Jobs retained" means an estimate of those previously existing filled positions that are retained as a result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as "full-time equivalent" (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor. For instance, two full-time employees and one part-time employee working half days would be reported as 2.5 FTE in each calendar quarter. <br />"Total compensation" means the cash and noncash dollar value earned by the executive during the contractor's past fiscal year of the following (for more information see 17 CFR 229.402(c)(2)): <br />(1) Salary and bonus. <br />(2) Awards of stock, stock options, and stock appreciation rights. Use the dollar amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes with respect to the fiscal year in accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004) (FAS 123R), Shared Based Payments. <br />(3) Earnings for services under non-equity incentive plans. Does not include group life, health, hospitalization or medical reimbursement plans that do not discriminate in favor of executives, and are available generally to all salaried employees. <br />(4) Change in pension value. This is the change in present value of defined benefit and actuarial pension plans. <br />(5) Above-market earnings on deferred compensation which is not tax-qualified. <br />(6) Other compensation. For example, severance, termination payments, value of life insurance paid on behalf of the employee, perquisites or property if the value for the executive exceeds $10,000. <br />(b) This contract requires the contractor to provide products and/or services that are funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). Section 1512(c) of the Recovery Act requires each contractor to report on its use of Recovery Act funds under this contract. These reports will be made available to the public. <br />(c) Reports from contractors for all work funded, in whole or in part, by the Recovery Act, and for which an invoice is submitted prior to June 30, 2009, are due no later than July 10, 2009. Thereafter, reports shall be submitted no later than the 10th day after the end of each calendar quarter. <br />(d) The Contractor shall report the following information, using the online reporting tool available at www.FederalReporting.gov. <br />(1) The Government contract and order number, as applicable. <br />(2) The amount of Recovery Act funds invoiced by the contractor for the reporting period. A cumulative amount from all the reports submitted for this action will be maintained by the government's on-line reporting tool. <br />(3) A list of all significant services performed or supplies delivered, including construction, for which the contractor invoiced in this calendar quarter. <br />(4) Program or project title, if any. <br />(5) A description of the overall purpose and expected outcomes or results of the contract, including significant deliverables and, if appropriate, associated units of measure. <br />(6) An assessment of the contractor's progress towards the completion of the overall purpose and expected outcomes or results of the contract (i.e., not started, less than 50 percent completed, completed 50 percent or more, or fully completed). This covers the contract (or portion thereof) funded by the Recovery Act. <br />(7) A narrative description of the employment impact of work funded by the Recovery Act. This narrative should be cumulative for each calendar quarter and only address the impact on the contractor's workforce. At a minimum, the contractor shall provide- <br />(i) A brief description of the types of jobs created and jobs retained in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). This description may rely on job titles, broader labor categories, or the contractor's existing practice for describing jobs as long as the terms used are widely understood and describe the general nature of the work; and <br />(ii) An estimate of the number of jobs created and jobs retained by the prime contractor, in the United States and outlying areas. A job cannot be reported as both created and retained. <br />(8) Names and total compensation of each of the five most highly compensated officers of the Contractor for the calendar year in which the contract is awarded if- <br />(i) In the Contractor's preceding fiscal year, the Contractor received- <br />(A) 80 percent or more of its annual gross revenues from Federal contracts (and subcontracts), loans, grants (and subgrants) and cooperative agreements; and <br />(B) $25,000,000 or more in annual gross revenues from Federal contracts (and subcontracts), loans, grants (and subgrants) and cooperative agreements; and <br />(ii) The public does not have access to information about the compensation of the senior executives through periodic reports filed under section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m(a), 78o(d)) or section 6104 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. <br />(9) For subcontracts valued at less than $25,000 or any subcontracts awarded to an individual, or subcontracts awarded to a subcontractor that in the previous tax year had gross income under $300,000, the Contractor shall only report the aggregate number of such first tier subcontracts awarded in the quarter and their aggregate total dollar amount. <br />(10) For any first-tier subcontract funded in whole or in part under the Recovery Act, that is over $25,000 and not subject to reporting under paragraph 9, the contractor shall require the subcontractor to provide the information described in (i), (ix), (x), and (xi) below to the contractor for the purposes of the quarterly report. The contractor shall advise the subcontractor that the information will be made available to the public as required by section 1512 of the Recovery Act. The contractor shall provide detailed information on these first-tier subcontracts as follows: <br />(i) Unique identifier (DUNS Number) for the subcontractor receiving the award and for the subcontractor's parent company, if the subcontractor has a parent company. <br />(ii) Name of the subcontractor. <br />(iii) Amount of the subcontract award. <br />(iv) Date of the subcontract award. <br />(v) The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. <br />(vi) Funding agency. <br />(vii) A description of the products or services (including construction) being provided under the subcontract, including the overall purpose and expected outcomes or results of the subcontract. <br />(viii) Subcontract number (the contract number assigned by the prime contractor). <br />(ix) Subcontractor's physical address including street address, city, state, and country.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This is a solicitation of Purchase Request 172-099F-2887 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-32.The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541990 with a small business size standard of $6.5 Million. This acquisition is a 100% set aside for small businesses. FOB shall be Destination.

All responsible Contractors shall provide a quote for the following  Statement of Work:

1.     INTRODUCTION

The Salt Lake Technical Center (SLTC) supports the OSHA mandate to protect workers from exposure to hazardous chemicals and unsafe work environments.  Field Compliance Officers sample for dust, inert dusts, nuisance dusts, and particle not otherwise regulated (PNOR); this includes all inert or nuisance dusts, whether mineral or inorganic. Samples are taken using a cyclone, where a known volume of air is drawn through a pre-weighed polyvinyl chloride (PVC) filter.  The results are forwarded to the Compliance Officer, allowing them to take the appropriate actions to protect the workers.
When dust samples are received by the SLTC, the filters are placed on an automated weighing system for sample analysis according to OSHA method PV2121.  The automated weighing system places the samples in a 40 oC oven initially for 35 hours.  The samples are then removed by the system where they are allowed to equilibrate in a climate controlled room for 6 hours.  The samples are then weighed by the automated weighting system and the weights recorded.  This process is completed until two consecutive weightings are within 10 micrograms.

An automated weight system is required for the analysis of nuisance dusts because it eliminates human error in weighing and recording compliance samples.  It also greatly reduces the analysis time because it is able to weigh samples during off hours such as nights and weekends when chemists are not allowed in the laboratory.  An automated weighing system increase productivity and accuracy of compliance samples.


2.	SCOPE OF WORK

Vendor will supply a custom robotic weighing system and all necessary components as listed in deliverables and on attachments.  Vendor will install and insure system is fully operational upon completion of installation.  Vendor will provide training as outlined in specifications of work. 

3.	STATEMENT OF WORK
	
Vendor will provide at least two days of on-site training and application development for employees of Salt Lake Technical Center.  Training will be provided by a qualified trainer with a knowledge of the instrumentation.  

The robotic system must be able to handle MSA part number 10012901, which is a 37 mm PVC filter assembly.  The assembly is comprised of a stainless steel backing disk, a PVC filter, and a conical aluminum shield.  The robotic system must be able to move the filter assemblies from a manually loaded rack (at least 100 samples per rack), to a station where the system makes a determination that a filter has been picked up, then to a bar code reading station, then place the filter into a vacuum drying oven, where the filters will dehydrate for 36 hours.  The system will then be required to move the filters back to the starting rack, where they will be allowed to equilibrate for 6 hours, after which the system will move each filter back to the determination station, then to the bar code reader, then to a microbalance.  The system must be capable of controlling the movement of the door.   The system will take 2 weights, average those weights together, and record the average in a text file.  The system will then move the filters back to the vacuum oven, and wait for 12 hours before repeating the process.  The second set of averaged weights need to be added to the original text file, but not over-writing the previous values.  The system will then compare the two sets of values for each filter, and repeat the process of any filters which have a variance of more than 10 micrograms.  When completed, the system will leave the weighed filters in the initial rack.
	   4.  DELIVERABLES

Vendor must provide a no-cost Telephone Technical Support group for user questions and troubleshooting.  Telephone Technical Support must be available. Service must be from a trained customer support engineer of the robot supplier and not an outside contractor.  The engineer must have the ability to rapidly troubleshoot and solve service related problems.  The supplier shall have sufficient engineers available to provide prompt response. 

 Acceptance Test Procedure

As a part of the installation and acceptance process, the Service Engineer will run an
Acceptance Test. The Acceptance Test Procedure defines the tests for demonstrating
the correct function and performance of the instrument. 

In addition to the normal and customary vendor acceptance tests, the instrument will be setup and optimized to run a complete, full analytical run, with no dropped or damaged filters, and produce a complete data file, which will be ready for export.

The following features are highly desirable:


	The system should be capable of automatically weighing both a 200 and a 500 microgram weight at the beginning of each analytical set, and record the results.
	The system should monitor the temperature and humidity in the room during the equilibration time and record a range for both that is tied to each weighing.  The measuring device must be NIST traceable.
	The system should be capable of sending an email to a list of persons if the temperature and or humidity exceed preset limits.

	The oven temperatures and vacuum levels should be software programmable, real time monitored, and stored.

	It would be desirable to have the availability to use small pans to hold nontraditional media.  These pans should provide the same level of automation as traditional filters.

	It would be desirable to have running more than one analytical program (differing parameters) at the same time.

	A delimited file format is desirable.

The OEM is MESSIER-DOWTY SA. All responsible contractors may submit an offer.  The contractor shall furnish a Certificate of Conformance in accordance with FAR Clause 52.246-15 and in the format specified in the clause.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [JUN 2006] [Full Text Follows]

(a) Prohibitions. 

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;

(g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 

(End of provision)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. 
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. 
     It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
     Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
    Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

This information is updated regularly and is accurate information.  The business process is separate from the technical process.  The Agency will not dictate the technology that is used, however, the technology platform selected must meet the Agencys technological architecture and security requirements. While the basic system for providing information would be similar, the Agency is currently looking to expand the role of its information system by centralizing all enforcement related information and making this information more accessible to enforcement staff.  This endeavor would potentially include the following: 1) adding more Agency rulemaking-related documents (i.e, exemption requests, petitions, etc.) and 2) creating a public version of MCREGIS (without documents designated as sensitive by FMCSA), that would be available to the public free of charge. 

Question: Indicate the planned overall lifetime of the new system. 

ANSWER: There is no end point.  We are building a system for the foreseeable future, and this is not an interim solution.     

Question: Which database(s) are in use? 

ANSWER:  Basic sources utilized to create the database will include Federal and State statutory and regulatory information include the U.S. Government Printing Office, U.S. Federal Register as well as individual State statutory and regulatory data.  Additionally, various transportation-related information sources maybe utilized such as the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) Out-of-Service Criteria, etc.  FMCSA will designate the information and documents to be included. 

Access to internally generated FMCSA documents such as enforcement interpretations, guidance and policy will be provided by FMCSA, either via hard copy or access to appropriate FMCSA electronic files.    

Question: On which platform existing application is running? 

ANSWER: The current software runs on the Windows 2000/XP/Vista operating system and the .NET Framework is Version 3.5 [required and included].   MCREGIS source content is XML and is a text-based system.   

Question: Is there any technological requirement to develop module? 

ANSWER: The technological requirements are spelled out in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The software must be compliant with U.S. DOT and FMCSA policies and procedures regarding Enterprise Architecture, Security and Accessibility Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794d).  The vendor must develop, support, maintain, upgrade and enhance an electronic database software system that (1) is fully compatible with Microsoft Windows operating systems, (2) meets all USDOT and FMCSA technical and security standards for software, (3) complies with generally-accepted software industry professional standards, (4) is designed and tested for maximum ease of use, (5) contains enhanced search capabilities, and (6) provides access to multiple sections of the data simultaneously.   
In addition, the below technology requirements apply for the development of FMCSA IT Systems. 
1.	Presentation of the applications content require the use of HTML 
2.	Identification and access of users requires the use of Sun Identity Manager
3.	Communication among clients, servers, services and systems requires the use of the HTTP Protocol
4.	FMCSA users require access to their applications via the FMCSA Portal that is supported by IBM WebSphere Portal 
5.	The database to be used for all data manipulation is Oracle 10g (Central Server Side)
6.	Mobile, Field or Distributed application require the use of the Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 or higher, including a SQL Server 2005/2008 database
7.	Interoperation among components of the application requires the use of Web services
8.	The use of XML is required for the encoding of data and messages
Question: What level of normalization is implemented on the existing databases? 

ANSWER: The current transactional database is relatively large.  Therefore, it is difficult, in the absence of data requirements, to objectively assess the level of normalization of the existing database.  However, a cursory look at the database coupled with assumptions regarding key business rules leads us to believe the database is primarily designed to third normal form (3NF).  There may have been some de-normalization for performance reasons.       

Question: Briefly describe contractual relationships with and between all entities that will contribute to the project &#8722;    Relationships between different organizations &#8722; Relationships between different components of the same organizations

Question: Define lifetime of each deliverable.

ANSWER: Until the deliverable has been deemed obsolete by Agency officials or is superseded in format or content.          


Question: Please clarify. Is this the regulations or something more? The application is content, not process-driven.

ANSWER: It includes all of the specified content.         


Question: Please clarify HTML management program. MCREGIS III used HTML; the current MCREGIS software is based on XML and stored in a compact SQL database. Style sheet renders it as HTML on-screen because the current MCREGIS software is using the browser.

ANSWER:  The current software management program is acceptable, as well as any other deemed acceptable by FMCSA during the planning and development phase. 


Question: Is FMCSA asking for the tutorial to be placed on their website for viewing? Or, within the user application?

Question: Please confirm that Symbols, Hazardous Materials Descriptions and Proper Shipping Names, Hazard Class or Division, Identification Numbers, and PG should be the headings listed in the horizontal tabular format and the hypertext link will link to a vertical listing of relevant regulatory text and illustrations.

ANSWER: The assumption is correct.           

Question: What should happen to notes, bookmarks, and highlights for an update when documents are replaced, edited, or deleted?

ANSWER: Notes, bookmarks, and highlights may be deleted when documents are replaced, edited or deleted.           
Question: Is this simply printing a displayed document which could be a form or something more?

ANSWER: It is simply viewing or printing included documents.           

Question: What is the scope of graphics to be provided?

ANSWER: Black and white illustrations as demonstrated in the CFR, tables, some logo applications, etc. Graphics will be minimal.            

Question: What content does FMCSA have in mind that will contain video, animation, and/or audio? Where will such content come from? How much of such content will be included? How often will new or updated content be added?

ANSWER:  At this time, FMCSA does not have any specific video, animation, or audio content in mind, but the application should support future use of such. The overall program must comply with requirements of the Section 508 Rehabilitation Act of USC 794d and the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 P.L. 105-220 (paragraph 23 of the PWS).  


Question: Certain content, such as PDFs and images arent normally available in HTML format. Is this acceptable to FMCSA?

ANSWER:  The only exporting will be via Windows-standard clipboarding of standard text, tables, and graphics.             

Question: What are the FMCSA specific requirements for a network version?

ANSWER: There is no network application.  The system is a combination of both a stand-alone desktop application and a web-based download system.           

Question: What other content or information must be monitored and updated?

ANSWER: This will have to be determined during the planning and design phase; the information will be minimal.           

Question: Are these new laws or regulations (titles, parts and etc.) DOT related? Or, do they encompass other areas such as OSHA, EPA, etc.?

ANSWER:  These will be laws and regulations related to commercial vehicle operations and safety. This is all inclusive as new laws, regulations are enacted or promulgated.  The capability must exist irrespective of where the new law or regulation emanates.           

Question: Would FMCSA entertain a contract modification to allow for the addition of new laws or regulations?

ANSWER: No.           


Question: Is the site a secure site that is not accessible to the public?

ANSWER: There will be two sites for downloads: (1) a secure site, FMCSA version; and (2) and a site accessible to the public (for the public version of MCREGIS).   The vendor will use a web-service for transmission of new files to secure USDOT servers.           


Question: Define enhanced search capabilities.

ANSWER: Industry-standard advanced dynamic search capabilities using Boolean operations, etc.            

Question:  Explain provides access to multiple sections of the data simultaneously.

ANSWER: From a dynamic search, present a list of possibilities, with access available to each possibility and then return to the search results without losing the search results.         


Question: How will the annual update be deployed to new users? Approximately how many new users will there be annually?

Question: Would previously installed users also receive a complete installation annually?

ANSWER: No.           

Question: Is this a full build of the software made available for download on the FMCSA website?

ANSWER: Yes.          

Question: How far in advance will training be scheduled?

ANSWER: This will be determined at the kickoff meeting with the vendor. The vendor will be provided adequate preparation time.           

Page 19

Question: Please provide a copy of DOT Order 1630.2B, Personnel Security Management.

ANSWER:  A copy may be obtained by sending an e-mail request to Richard.clemente@dot.gov.      

Question: Please explain this requirement. Universal graphic formats such as .jpg or .png are more typical.

ANSWER:  The requirement is as stated in the PWS. 


Question: What are the FMCSA headquarters electronic system compatibility requirements?
ANSWER:  Will be discussed further with vendor during planning and design phase.  These requirements are incorporated in the technology requirements and standards. Please see the answers to these questions on this document.

Question: Files that are larger than 5 megabytes shall be transmitted via compact disc, secure FTP, or other method to be determined in consultation with the COTR.

Is this requirement in reference to "project related" information or content within the "product?"

ANSWER: Both.          


Question: Please define development, generation, configuration and management?

ANSWER: Vendor shall propose prices in accordance with the requirements of this RFP and define work to be done under each CLIN to meet requirements of the PWS and in accordance with the industry.       

Question: What are the key shortcomings with the existing MCREGIS system that have motivated the request for a new solution? What data is not currently addressed by MCREGIS that the new system needs to address?  

ANSWER:  This solicitation is a result of the contract expiration for use of existing software.  No key shortcomings were identified. 
Question: What organizational roles (e.g., safety enforcement personnel at the federal and state levels, commercial carriers, emergency responders) are the primary users for the new system?

ANSWER:  This could be any  especially since a public version will be provided.           

Question: Will the FMCSA Web Style Guide be provided before the RFP response deadline?
	
ANSWER:   The FMCSA Web style guide can be provided upon request; however, the vendor will not be developing FMCSA web pages or content.  

Question: Does the user interface need to be fully functional on mobile devices (e.g., smart phones such as the Blackberry)?

ANSWER: No.           

Question: Does single user installation mean offline access to the web site?

ANSWER:  We do not understand the question.          

Question: Which computers will be hosting the software solution and who is responsible for the system administration efforts?

ANSWER: There is a stand-alone component as described in the PWS.  The operation of the website for downloads will be the responsibility of the FMCSA.  A web service will be utilized to transmit new files from the vendor to FMCSA secure servers.           

Question:  Does the DOT receive all information for this site from internal DOT sources? How often do site changes occur?  How are information changes on external and/or other non-MCREGIS application-based synchronized to change MCREGIS as well? 

ANSWER: The website is only used for downloading updates.  This is not a web-based application.  There is no synchronization of MCREGIS with external sources.           

Question: Based on the statement The system must be designed so that users may install the software application and subsequent updates directly from CD-ROM/DVD and/or online. Is the assumption correct that the application must exist as a smart client which can be used in a disconnected mode (i.e. offline)? 

ANSWER: Yes.           

Question: How many required training sessions can be assumed?  Is there a specific method in which training is to be delivered (in person, virtual?) 

ANSWER: No more than four per calendar year, as stated in the PWS.  The method will be determined in coordination with the vendor.           

Question: Under Meet minimum system requirements, what is meant by Utilize an HTML management program? 

ANSWER: The content is to be managed via HTML, but documents (pdf, Word, etc.) do not have to be converted.  FMCSA-provided documents may need modification by the vendor for Section 508 compliance.             

Question: Does FMCSA want a redesigned web site as part of the solution or is FMCSA just seeking to redesign the database system behind the current web interface?

ANSWER: This is a stand-alone client application.  The website is only used to download updates.           

Question: What is the user interface page count for the current MCREGIS system which includes sensitive data?

ANSWER:  This information is not considered relevant to the proposal.  The website will be housed and managed by FMCSA.           

Question: Who implemented the current MCREGIS system?

ANSWER: J.J. Keller and Associates, Inc.            

Question: Can we propose an extension to the original response solicitation date?

ANSWER: Solicitation has been extended to July 21, 2009.

4.7 Security Requirements


4.7.1 Personnel Security

4.7.1.1 The USAO will process background security investigations for grand jury court reporter Contractor personnel required for performance of this contract.  Employees of the Contractor shall not be assigned to grand jury transcription work under this contract unless and until the Contractor has been notified, in writing, by authorized Department of Justice personnel stating the employee has been granted necessary security approval.  If the Contractor is notified during the life of this contract by an official of the USAO that an employee's access to grand jury information has been revoked or suspended, the Contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer.  The Contractor's total loss of access approval for grand jury court reporters shall be cause for termination of this contract.

4.7.1.2 The Contractor shall submit to the USAO a list of the names of all principals, staff members, and regular employees requiring access to the work performed under the contract.  This includes personnel of the principal Contractor and any subcontractor and consultants.  No employee may be used on grand jury testimony until the Contractor has, for each individual, received in writing the approval of the USAOs. 

4.7.1.3 Should grand jury proceedings require access to classified National Security Information by personnel of the Contractor additional safeguards will be required to protect that information in accordance with the provisions of Title 28 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 17.  In such instances, national security clearances for the Contractor's personnel will be required in accordance with Department of Justice policies. 

4.7.1.4  In the event the USAOs is unable to obtain security approval to grand jury information for the Contractor by the beginning date of a proceeding, the Government reserves the right to obtain the required services from another source, which has employment security approval for grand jury court reporters. 

4.7.1.5 The Contractor agrees to ensure any subcontractor proposed for the furnishing of supplies and services which will involve access to grand jury information in the Contractor's custody has the appropriate employment security approval in effect prior to being afforded access to grand jury information.

4.7.2	Required Security Investigation

4.7.2.1 The Contractor shall assure that all persons to be utilized in the performance of this contract submit to the Government the following Government security investigation forms prior to assignment hereunder.  The intent and purpose of the investigation are to preclude the assignment of any individual who poses a threat to the Government or successful contract completion due to past unlawful or inappropriate behavior.  The contract employee must furnish all required data in the form and format determined by the United States Attorney (USA) or his/her duly authorized representative.  The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor in writing, with a concurrent copy to the Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR), of the results of the investigation.

4.7.2.2 Risk Level

In general, services performed by Contractor personnel may fall within three (3) risk categories as described below:

High Risk   Are those sensitive positions that have the potential for exceptionally serious impact involving duties especially critical to the DOJ or a program mission with broad scope of policy or program authority, such as:
 

	Policy development or implementation

	Higher-level management assignment

	Independent spokespersons or non-management positions with authority for independent action,

	Significant fiduciary and procurement authority and responsibilities, and 

	IT-computer positions responsible for the planning, and implementation of a computer security program; the direction, planning and design of a computer system, including the hardware and software; or, accessing a system during the operation or maintenance in such a way, with relatively High Risk to cause grave damage or realizing significant personal gain. (Refer to Appendix III, OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, for those computer positions that are High Risk at www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a130/a130appendix_iii.html).

Moderate Risk - Are those sensitive positions that have the potential for moderate to serious impact involving duties very important to the DOJ or program mission with significant program responsibilities and delivery of client services to the public, such as:

	Assistance to policy development and implementation,

	Mid-level management assignments,

	Non-management positions with authority for independent or semi-independent action,

	Delivery of service positions that demand public confidence or trust,

	IT-computer positions of a lesser degree of risk that required for High Risk positions (Refer to Appendix III, OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, for those computer positions that are other than High Risk.).

Low Risk (Non-sensitive) - Are those non-sensitive positions that do not fall into any of the above categories and include those positions with potential for impact involving duties of limited relation to the DOJ mission.

4.7.2.3	Types and Numbers of Background Investigations

Work performed under this BPA will fall within one or more of the risk categories defined paragraph 4.7.2.2.  As a result, the Contractor's personnel must undergo a background investigation commensurate with the assessed risk category.  In addition, before the issuance of any calls for additional personnel, the COTR, the exact number and types of background investigations required for all Contractor positions hired under this BPA.
 
The Contractor will not be permitted to commence performance under the BPA until a sufficient number of its personnel, as determined by the COTR received requisite background investigations or approved pre-appointment background investigation waivers.

During the life of the BPA, the Contractor shall ensure that no Contractor or Subcontractor employee commences performance hereunder prior to receipt of written authorization from the Contracting Officer or the COTR.

4.7.2.4 Pre-Appointment Background Investigations and Waivers

Background investigations must be conducted and favorably adjudicated for each contract employee prior to commencing work on this task order.  However, where programmatic needs do not permit the Government to wait for completion of the entire background investigation, the SPM, in consultation with the COTR, can grant a pre-appointment background investigation waiver.  The extent of the background investigation and/or the information needed to waive the background investigation will vary depending upon the Risk Category associated with each position.  A waiver will be revoked if the resulting investigation uncovers derogatory information that cannot be resolved in the contract employees favor.  When derogatory information has been discovered that cannot be resolved in the contract employees favor, the employee should be removed from the contract.  Minimum pre-appointment investigative requirements are listed below. 

High Risk Positions. The background investigation shall be an LBI (Limited Background Investigation) consisting of a personal subject interview, NAC, credit history check, written inquiries and record searches covering 5 years, and personal interviews covering specific areas during the most recent 3 years.  Pre-appointment waivers may be granted following a successful National Crime Information Center (NCIC) check, vouchering of previous 2 employers and a favorable review of forms submitted.

Moderate Risk Positions. The background investigation shall be a NACI (National Agency Check and Inquiries) consisting of a NAC, written inquiries, and record searches covering specific areas of a subjects background during the past 5 years.  Pre-appointment waivers may be granted following a favorable NCIC check and a favorable review of forms submitted.

	Low Risk Positions.  The background investigation shall be a Federal Bureau of 	Investigation Name and Fingerprint check.  Pre-appointment waivers may be granted 	following a favorable NCIC check.

4.7.2.5 The following forms and submission dates shall be adhered to by the Contractor for each type of investigation listed below.  The forms shall be submitted to the designated COTR or point of contact within seven days after receipt of the forms.

	Title and Number of Form

Public Trust Positions

4.7.2.6 Procedures for Pre-Screening Applicants and Investigations

Contractors Responsibility - The Contractor must determine whether the conduct of the person being considered for assignment on this contract indicates a potential for behavior which would interfere with, prevent, or otherwise impact adversely on:  1) the position to be filled by applicant; 2) the performance of the duties and responsibilities of others on the BPA or in the Government; or 3) the ability of the employing agency to effectively carry out its mandated responsibilities.  If the Contractor determines that employing an applicant will not promote the efficiency of this BPA, the applicant must be disqualified from assignment on the BPA.   In this regard, the Contractor shall be responsible for performing the following pre-screening and investigative duties for all persons proposed for work under this BPA:

(a) Furnish to each proposed Contractor employee the forms described in Section 5 and ensure that adequate instructions for completing the forms are provided to each applicant. 

(b) Ensure that applicants obtain two (2) complete sets of their fingerprints on the prescribed Form FD-258 from an organization qualified to take fingerprints.

(c) Collect completed forms from each applicant and review all forms for completeness and correctness.  Return any incomplete or incorrect form(s) to applicant(s) to be corrected and re-submitted.

(d) Submit completed forms to the COTR by no later than seven (7) calendar days after receipt of the blank forms.

4.7.2.7 Contractor Status under the National Industrial Security Program (NISP)

Companies participating in the National Security Program (NISP) are required the meet certain federal standards for the investigation of facilities and employees.  If the Contractor is a registered in the NISP, investigation initiated by the Department may not be required.  The COTR should determine if the Contractor is registered in the NISP, then the facility clearance level held by the Contractor, and if individuals selected to work for the Department were previously investigated in accordance with NISP procedures.  If an individual selected to work for the Department was previously investigated within the last 12 months, the COTR will obtain a copy of the Letter of Consent (LOC) issued by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO). 

4.7.2.8 Factors for Suitability Determinations.  The Department of Justice uses several basic factors in making suitability determinations for contract employees.  This information is intended as a guide for the Contractor during their screening process and is not inclusive of all disqualifying situations.

Disqualifying Factors   The following conduct factors, as disclosed on the SF-85P and the SF-85P-S, in a written statement or personal interview with the applicant, or established during a reference check may disqualify an applicant from employment on a DOJ contract.  Contractors should be aware such individuals may not be able to work for the Department under the BPA.

Criminal Behavior (e.g., a conviction resulting from a serious felony -- murder, rape, armed robbery, etc. -- regardless of when the conviction occurred; a felony conviction, notwithstanding the severity of the crime, within the previous seven (7) years; a period of incarceration as a result of a felony conviction within the previous seven (7) years; or pending indictments or criminal charges)

Infamous or disgraceful conduct (e.g., sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted, or bizarre behavior indicating depravity)

Improper or illegal involvement with drugs within the past 7 years.

Current and continuing alcohol abuse

Intentional false statement, deception, fraud in appointment (e.g., altering the condition of discharge on military discharge documents, altering college transcripts, falsely completing the SF-85P or SF-85P-S, etc.)

Financial considerations (e.g., deceptive or illegal financial practices; continuing inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; financial problems linked to such dependencies on alcohol, drugs, gambling, etc.)

Non-U.S. Citizenship (e.g. non-legal residents; recent legal residents, residing in the U.S. less than four years; non-U.S. citizens maintaining citizenship in "hostile" countries)

Questionable Allegiance to the United States (e.g., membership in organizations or association with individuals advocating violence or overthrow of the U.S. government or involvement in any act of sabotage, espionage, treason, terrorism, or sedition)

Emotional, mental, and personality disorders (when a credentialed mental health professional acceptable to the government has determined that the individual has a condition or treatment that may indicate a defect in judgment, reliability or stability or could physically harm him/herself or others)

Previous security violations (e.g., unauthorized disclosure of classified information or deliberate or multiple violations)

Misuse of information technology systems (e.g. illegal or unauthorized entry into or illegal, unauthorized, or improper use of an information technology system) 

Foreign Influence (e.g. when an individuals immediate family, including co-habitants and other who the individual is bound by close ties or affection, is not a U.S. citizen and may be subject to coercion and/or duress)

Foreign Preference (e.g. and individuals behavior indicates a preference for a foreign country over the United States)

4.7.2.9 Mitigating Factors When questionable conduct is disclosed, the following factors should be considered as to whether or not disqualification of an individual for work in the Department is warranted.  The decision is made on a case-by-case basis, and is subject to review by the assigned Security Officer, in consultation with the COTR.

(a) The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct.

	(b) The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation.

	(c) The frequency and recency of the conduct.

	(d) The individuals age and maturity at the time of the conduct.

	(e) The voluntaries of participation.

(f) The presence or absence of rehabilitation, resolution, and other pertinent behavioral 
     changes.

	(g) The motivation for the conduct.

	(h) The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress.

	(i) The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.

4.7.2.10 Given the above guidelines for determining suitability, the Contractor should be able to determine, without DOJ involvement, which applicants are unsuitable for employment under this contract.  However, additional questions and requests for information may result from review of the security packages by DOJ personnel.  In the event the Department or the contractor has reasonable cause to believe that an employee under the BPA falls under any of the eleven mandatory disqualification factors listed above, the employee must be removed from this BPA.  In addition, all contract employees are expected to adhere to the Department's Standards of Conduct.

4.7.2.11 The COTR will notify the Contractor of the results of background investigations as they are completed and adjudicated.  The COTR will also notify the Contractor of any applicants who are found ineligible for employment under this contract so that the Contractor can immediately recruit and initiate paperwork to clear replacement applicants.  If a contract employee is already working on the BPA and is determined to be ineligible, he or she will be removed from the call order.

4.7.212 The COTR will notify the Contracting Officer when a sufficient number of Contractor employees have received employment security approvals or pre-appointment waivers approvals.  Upon receipt of this information and any other information, which may be required elsewhere in the BPA, the Contracting Officer will issue the Contractor a Notice to Proceed, which permits the commencement of work under the call(s).

4.7.2.13 The Contractor shall ensure no contract or subcontract employee commences performance hereunder prior to receipt of a written authorization from the Contracting Officer.

4.7.2.14 The Contractor shall make every effort to preclude incurrence of costs by the Government for security investigations for replacement of employees, and in so doing shall ensure otherwise satisfactory and physically able employees assigned hereunder remain in contract performance for at least one year.  The Contractor shall take all necessary steps to assure contract or subcontract personnel selected for assignment to this contract are professionally qualified and personally reliable, of reputable background and sound character, and meet all other requirements stipulated herein.  The fact the Government performs security investigations shall not in any manner relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to ensure that all personnel furnished are reliable and of reputable background and sound character.  Should a security investigation conducted by the Government render ineligible a Contractor-furnished employee, the Contracting Officer will investigate the cause and determine whether the Contractor has abdicated his responsibility to make every effort to select reliable employees of reputable background and sound character.  Should there be a need to replace a contract or subcontract employee due to non-performance, the Contracting Officer will determine whether the Contractor has abdicated his responsibilities to make every effort to select trained and experienced employees.

4.7.2.15  Should the Contracting Officer determine the Contractor has failed to comply with the terms of paragraph above, the Contractor may be held monetarily responsible, at a minimum, for all reasonable and necessary costs incurred by the Government to (a) provide coverage (performance) through assignment of individuals employed by the Government or third parties in those cases where absence of contract personnel would cause either a security threat or DOJ program disruption, and (b) conduct security investigations in excess of those which would otherwise be required.  

4.7.2.16 Nothing in this clause shall require the Contractor to bear costs involved in the conduct of security investigations for replacement of an employee who becomes deceased or severely ill for a long period of time.

4.7.2.17 Under no circumstances shall the Contractor fail to comply with the terms and conditions set forth herein without assuming liability for such failure as may be established pursuant to this clause.  The rights and remedies conferred upon the Government by this clause are in addition to all and other rights and remedies specified elsewhere in this contract or established by law.

4.7.3	Protection of Grand Jury Information

4.7.3.1 Grand jury testimony is sensitive Limited Official Use information, which must be protected against disclosure to unauthorized personnel.  Pursuant to Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedures, disclosures of matters occurring before the grand jury other than its deliberations and the vote of any juror may be made available to the attorneys for the Government to use in the performance of their duties.  Otherwise a juror, attorney, interpreter, stenographer, or operator of a recorded testimony may disclose matters occurring before the grand jury only when so directed by the court.

4.7.3.2 It shall be the duty of the Official Reporter to safeguard all materials relating to grand jury hearings, which are in his/her possession and/or under his/her custody.  The USA may at his/her discretion retain custody of the material, including notes, tapes, drafts, etc., and require all transcribing and typing of the grand jury information be done within the USAO.

4.7.3.3 The Contractor shall hold inviolate and in the strictest confidence any and all information of an official character which he/she may gain in the performance of his/her duties under this agreement.  The Contractor shall not divulge, sell, or distribute any information gained at a grand jury proceeding, except as authorized by the presiding official. 

 
	
4.7.4	Contractor Physical Security Requirements

4.7.4.1 Contractor employees assigned to work areas where Grand Jury information is processed, stored, or transcribed must challenge the presence of any unknown or unauthorized person.  The need-to-know principle shall be adhered to at all times within the closed area.  When the materials are not stored in security containers or vaults, and when in actual use by authorized personnel, they shall be protected as follows:
o	Kept under constant surveillance by an authorized person who is in a physical position to exercise direct security controls over the material. 
o	Covered, turned face down, placed in storage containers, or otherwise protected when unauthorized persons are present. 
o	The room containing the materials must be locked when vacated for short periods of time. 
o	Returned to storage containers as soon as practicable after use. Grand jury material shall not be removed from the premises of the court reporter for transcription except for delivery to the USAOs. Approved storage containers include: the GSA Class 6 security container; a lock-bar file cabinet (with a GSA approved lock); or 3-position dial safe. 

4.7.4.2 SPS will fund the security system required for this action.

4.7.4.3   End-of-day security checks shall be performed within the contract facility to ensure that precautions are taken to protect grand jury material. The court reporter firm shall designate an individual or individuals, to make daily checks to ensure all grand jury material has been properly stored. This can be the Grand Jury Court Reporter personnel, or another individual who has been granted security approval by the EOUSA SPS.

4.7.4.4   The Contracting Officer or his/her authorized representative, of the USAO, shall have the right to inspect at reasonable intervals, but at least annually, the procedures, equipment, and facilities used by the Contractor to comply with these requirements.

4.7.4.5   If the contractor is unable to provide the required physical security in his/her workplace, a work area and storage space for Grand Jury transcript processing will be provided at the USAO.

4.7.5   Information Technology

4.7.5.1 Information Technology Equipment refers to computers, steno machines, transcription devices, printers, scanners, and all other technological devices used to electronically process grand jury information for the USAO.

4.7.5.2   When grand jury court reporters process grand jury information outside the USAO while utilizing Information Technology equipment that is not the property of the USAO, the equipment will be used in a dedicated, stand-alone, single user mode (no network capability). The information must be unclassified. All processing must be done on removable storage media (floppy disks, CDs, removable hard drives, cartridges). Removable storage media must be marked "Grand Jury Information." When marking the media, no acronyms should be used. 

4.7.5.3 In addition, any Information Technology equipment used to process USAO information may be subject to certification/accreditation and/or disk-based sanitization to protect grand jury information. As a general rule, grand jury court reporters may not use personally-owned PCs and equipment to process grand jury information. Personally-owned PCs and equipment are those devices the grand jury court reporter uses to conduct personal projects related to obligations, affairs, assets, or life of the operator.

4.7.5.4 When grand jury court reporter owned PCs are used, and/or have fixed hard drives, and the PC is also used for transcription work outside of the USAO, the equipment must have the ability to download to USAO equipment or storage media. In addition, temporary files must be deleted from the grand jury court reporters equipment using the currently approved USAO sanitization method. 

4.7.5.5 Access to information technology equipment must be controlled and restricted to personnel authorized to handle grand jury information and having appropriate access approval. Unauthorized personnel must not be permitted to view any grand jury information. The equipment must be turned off, or otherwise disabled, when not in use.

4.7.5.6 The removable media must be stored in an approved security container or lockable file cabinet (in accordance with 6.C.1) after normal working hours or when the equipment is not in use.

1.2 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

The Department of Justice may award multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) resulting from this Request for Quotation.  A Contractor may be eliminated based on its prices, in comparison to other Contractors prices.  The Government may also eliminate a Contractor based on Contractors past performance history and failure to provide documentation necessary to verify the acceptability of their court reporters.  A Contractor shall provide the additional information listed below:  

1.2.1	Qualifications of Proposed Staff  The Government reserves the right to request at any time the professional qualifications of Contractor personnel.  This information will be used to ascertain the depth of relevant requisite training, skills and professional certification of personnel.  

1.2.2	Past Performance  Provide (3) references for commensurate projects that are in progress or were completed within the last three (3) years.  If a Contractor will be using a subcontractor, three (3) references must be provided for the subcontractor as well.  References may be from commercial and federal/state Government contracts; however, similar support services performed for Federal Government customers generally will be considered more relevant than those done for commercial or state government customers.  The following information is required for each reference:

o	Customer name and address.
o	Point of contact (name, title, telephone number, and fax number) for contractual/administrative matters (e.g., Contracting Officer) and technical performance (e.g., Contracting Officers Technical Representative).

E.2 Evaluation Criteria

DOJ may award up to two (2) awards as a result of this solicitation.  

E.2.1 Evaluation criteria:
The Government will evaluate prospective contractors past performance and price in making an award decision.

3.1.1	Past Performance -- Past Performance is a measure of the degree to which a Contractor, as an organization, has satisfied its customers.  The EOUSA will           check each contractors client references to inquire about (1) the quality and timeliness of the vendors work; (2) reasonableness of its business behavior; and, (3) technical and management capabilities.  The EOUSA will attempt to check the references provided by the contractor, particularly commensurate tasks, and may expand the evaluation to include references not contained in the vendors submission.  The actual number of references checked is entirely at the EOUSAs discretion.

3.1.2   Price - The Government intends to make BPA/contract award(s) to the offerors whose proposal represents the best value to the Government. The evaluation of price will be based on the Government estimate of quantities and the offerors total price.  If the Government determines that there are significant differences in technical merit among competing proposals, then a more expensive proposal may be selected for award where the Government determines that the value of the selected proposal is worth the price differential.

Each vendors price proposal will be evaluated to assess the reasonableness of proposed prices. This evaluation will be based on the information and supporting data provided in the proposal and its compatibility with the evaluation factors identified above. 

In making this determination, the Government is more concern with obtaining performance capability superiority rather than overall price.

ATTACHMENTS 

D.1 CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEE RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT

All Contractor employees assigned to this contract and working within the United States shall meet the DOJ Residency Requirement.  The Residency Requirement states that, for three of the five years immediately prior to applying for a position, the individual must have: 1) resided in the United States; 2) worked for the United States overseas in a Federal or military capacity; or 3) be a dependent of a Federal or military employee serving overseas.

This requirement can be waived for short-term (i.e., those employees performing duties for a cumulative total of 14 days or less) if there is a critical need for their specialized or unique skills (for example, interpreters for rare foreign languages).  These individuals must be United States citizens or Permanent Resident Aliens.  A waiver request from the head of the Component outlining the extenuating circumstances along with the requisite Contractor clearance package shall be submitted through the Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) to the Department Security Officer (DSO) for approval.  Each waiver request will be reviewed by the DSO and a determination made on a case-by-case basis.

Additionally, a Contractor employee who is not a U.S. citizen must be from a country allied with the United States.  Since the countries on the Allied Countries List are subject to change, the head of the Component shall review the following website for current information: http://www.opm.gov/employ/html/Citizen.htm.


D. 3 Continuing Contract Performance During a Pandemic Influenza or other National 
         Emergency 


Continuing Contract Performance During a Pandemic Influenza
or other National Emergency

During a Pandemic or other emergency we understand that our contractor workforce will experience the same high levels of absenteeism as our federal employees. Although the Excusable Delays and Termination for Default clauses used in government contracts list epidemics and quarantine restrictions among the reasons to excuse delays in contract performance, we expect our contractors to make a reasonable effort to keep performance at an acceptable level during emergency periods. 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has provided guidance to federal managers and employees on the kinds of actions to be taken to ensure the continuity of operations during emergency periods. This guidance is also applicable to our contract workforce. Contractors are expected to have reasonable policies in place for continuing work performance, particularly those performing mission critical services, during a pandemic influenza or other emergency situation. 

The types of actions a federal contractor should reasonably take to help ensure performance are: 

	Encourage employees to get inoculations or follow other preventive measures as advised by the public health service. 

	Contractors should cross-train workers as backup for all positions performing critical services. This is particularly important for work such as guard services where telework is not an option. 

	Implement telework to the greatest extent possible in the workgroup so systems are in place to support successful remote work in an emergency. 

	Communicate expectations to all employees regarding their roles and responsibilities in relation to remote work in the event of a pandemic health crisis or other emergency. 

	Establish communication processes to notify employees of activation of this plan. 

	Integrate pandemic health crisis response expectations into telework agreements. 

	With the employee, assess requirements for working at home (supplies and equipment needed for an extended telework period). Contract Security requirements must be considered in making equipment choices; agencies or contractors may wish to avoid use of employees' personal computers and provide them with PCs or laptops as appropriate. 

	Determine how all employees who may telework will communicate with one another and with management to accomplish work. 

	Practice telework regularly to ensure effectiveness.


	Make it clear that in emergency situations, employees must perform all duties assigned by management, even if they are outside usual or customary duties. 

	Identify how time and attendance will be maintained. 

It is the contractor's responsibility to advise the government contracting officer or COTR if they anticipate not being able to perform and to work with the Department to fill gaps as necessary. This means direct communication with the contracting officer, COTR or in his/her absence, another responsible person in the contracting office via telephone or email messages acknowledging the contractors notification. The incumbent contractor is responsible for assisting the Department in estimating the adverse impacts of nonperformance and to work diligently with the Department to develop a strategy for maintaining the continuity of operations. 

The Department does reserve the right in such emergency situations to use federal employees, employees of other agencies, contract support from other existing contractors, or to enter into new contracts for critical support services. Any new contracting efforts would be acquired following the guidance in the Office of federal Procurement Policy issuance "Emergency Acquisitions", May, 2007 and Subpart 18.2 Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.

4.7.2.2 Risk Level

In general, services performed by Contractor personnel may fall within three (3) risk categories as described below:

High Risk   Are those sensitive positions that have the potential for exceptionally serious impact involving duties especially critical to the DOJ or a program mission with broad scope of policy or program authority, such as:
 

	Policy development or implementation

	Higher-level management assignment

	Independent spokespersons or non-management positions with authority for independent action,

	Significant fiduciary and procurement authority and responsibilities, and 

	IT-computer positions responsible for the planning, and implementation of a computer security program; the direction, planning and design of a computer system, including the hardware and software; or, accessing a system during the operation or maintenance in such a way, with relatively High Risk to cause grave damage or realizing significant personal gain. (Refer to Appendix III, OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, for those computer positions that are High Risk at www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a130/a130appendix_iii.html).

Moderate Risk - Are those sensitive positions that have the potential for moderate to serious impact involving duties very important to the DOJ or program mission with significant program responsibilities and delivery of client services to the public, such as:

	Assistance to policy development and implementation,

	Mid-level management assignments,

	Non-management positions with authority for independent or semi-independent action,

	Delivery of service positions that demand public confidence or trust,

	IT-computer positions of a lesser degree of risk that required for High Risk positions (Refer to Appendix III, OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, for those computer positions that are other than High Risk.).

Low Risk (Non-sensitive) - Are those non-sensitive positions that do not fall into any of the above categories and include those positions with potential for impact involving duties of limited relation to the DOJ mission.

4.7.2.3	Types and Numbers of Background Investigations

Work performed under this BPA will fall within one or more of the risk categories defined paragraph 4.7.2.2.

In addition, before the issuance of any calls for additional personnel, the COTR, the exact number and types of background investigations required for all Contractor positions hired under this BPA.
 
The Contractor will not be permitted to commence performance under the BPA until a sufficient number of its personnel, as determined by the COTR received requisite background investigations or approved pre-appointment background investigation waivers.

During the life of the BPA, the Contractor shall ensure that no Contractor or Subcontractor employee commences performance hereunder prior to receipt of written authorization from the Contracting Officer or the COTR.

4.7.2.4 Pre-Appointment Background Investigations and Waivers

Background investigations must be conducted and favorably adjudicated for each contract employee prior to commencing work on this task order.  However, where programmatic needs do not permit the Government to wait for completion of the entire background investigation, the SPM, in consultation with the COTR, can grant a pre-appointment background investigation waiver.  The extent of the background investigation and/or the information needed to waive the background investigation will vary depending upon the Risk Category associated with each position.  A waiver will be revoked if the resulting investigation uncovers derogatory information that cannot be resolved in the contract employees favor.  When derogatory information has been discovered that cannot be resolved in the contract employees favor, the employee should be removed from the contract.  Minimum pre-appointment investigative requirements are listed below. 

High Risk Positions. The background investigation shall be an LBI (Limited Background Investigation) consisting of a personal subject interview, NAC, credit history check, written inquiries and record searches covering 5 years, and personal interviews covering specific areas during the most recent 3 years.  Pre-appointment waivers may be granted following a successful National Crime Information Center (NCIC) check, vouchering of previous 2 employers and a favorable review of forms submitted.

4.7.2.6 Procedures for Pre-Screening Applicants and Investigations

Contractors Responsibility - The Contractor must determine whether the conduct of the person being considered for assignment on this contract indicates a potential for behavior which would interfere with, prevent, or otherwise impact adversely on:  1) the position to be filled by applicant; 2) the performance of the duties and responsibilities of others on the BPA or in the Government; or 3) the ability of the employing agency to effectively carry out its mandated responsibilities.  If the Contractor determines that employing an applicant will not promote the efficiency of this BPA, the applicant must be disqualified from assignment on the BPA.   In this regard, the Contractor shall be responsible for performing the following pre-screening and investigative duties for all persons proposed for work under this BPA:

(a) Furnish to each proposed Contractor employee the forms described in Section 5 and ensure that adequate instructions for completing the forms are provided to each applicant. 

(b) Ensure that applicants obtain two (2) complete sets of their fingerprints on the prescribed Form FD-258 from an organization qualified to take fingerprints.

(c) Collect completed forms from each applicant and review all forms for completeness and correctness.  Return any incomplete or incorrect form(s) to applicant(s) to be corrected and re-submitted.

(d) Submit completed forms to the COTR by no later than seven (7) calendar days after receipt of the blank forms.

4.7.2.7 Contractor Status under the National Industrial Security Program (NISP)

Companies participating in the National Security Program (NISP) are required the meet certain federal standards for the investigation of facilities and employees.  If the Contractor is a registered in the NISP, investigation initiated by the Department may not be required.  The COTR should determine if the Contractor is registered in the NISP, then the facility clearance level held by the Contractor, and if individuals selected to work for the Department were previously investigated in accordance with NISP procedures.  If an individual selected to work for the Department was previously investigated within the last 12 months, the COTR will obtain a copy of the Letter of Consent (LOC) issued by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO). 

4.7.2.8 Factors for Suitability Determinations.  The Department of Justice uses several basic factors in making suitability determinations for contract employees.  This information is intended as a guide for the Contractor during their screening process and is not inclusive of all disqualifying situations.

Disqualifying Factors   The following conduct factors, as disclosed on the SF-85P and the SF-85P-S, in a written statement or personal interview with the applicant, or established during a reference check may disqualify an applicant from employment on a DOJ contract.  Contractors should be aware such individuals may not be able to work for the Department under the BPA.

Criminal Behavior (e.g., a conviction resulting from a serious felony -- murder, rape, armed robbery, etc. -- regardless of when the conviction occurred; a felony conviction, notwithstanding the severity of the crime, within the previous seven (7) years; a period of incarceration as a result of a felony conviction within the previous seven (7) years; or pending indictments or criminal charges)

Infamous or disgraceful conduct (e.g., sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted, or bizarre behavior indicating depravity)

Improper or illegal involvement with drugs within the past 7 years.

Current and continuing alcohol abuse

Intentional false statement, deception, fraud in appointment (e.g., altering the condition of discharge on military discharge documents, altering college transcripts, falsely completing the SF-85P or SF-85P-S, etc.)

Financial considerations (e.g., deceptive or illegal financial practices; continuing inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; financial problems linked to such dependencies on alcohol, drugs, gambling, etc.)

Non-U.S. Citizenship (e.g. non-legal residents; recent legal residents, residing in the U.S. less than four years; non-U.S. citizens maintaining citizenship in "hostile" countries)

Questionable Allegiance to the United States (e.g., membership in organizations or association with individuals advocating violence or overthrow of the U.S. government or involvement in any act of sabotage, espionage, treason, terrorism, or sedition)

Emotional, mental, and personality disorders (when a credentialed mental health professional acceptable to the government has determined that the individual has a condition or treatment that may indicate a defect in judgment, reliability or stability or could physically harm him/herself or others)

Previous security violations (e.g., unauthorized disclosure of classified information or deliberate or multiple violations)

Misuse of information technology systems (e.g. illegal or unauthorized entry into or illegal, unauthorized, or improper use of an information technology system) 

Foreign Influence (e.g. when an individuals immediate family, including co-habitants and other who the individual is bound by close ties or affection, is not a U.S. citizen and may be subject to coercion and/or duress)

Foreign Preference (e.g. and individuals behavior indicates a preference for a foreign country over the United States)

4.7.2.9 Mitigating Factors When questionable conduct is disclosed, the following factors should be considered as to whether or not disqualification of an individual for work in the Department is warranted.  The decision is made on a case-by-case basis, and is subject to review by the assigned Security Officer, in consultation with the COTR.

(a) The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct.

	(b) The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation.

	(c) The frequency and recency of the conduct.

	(d) The individuals age and maturity at the time of the conduct.

	(e) The voluntaries of participation.

(f) The presence or absence of rehabilitation, resolution, and other pertinent behavioral 
     changes.

	(g) The motivation for the conduct.

	(h) The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress.

	(i) The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.

4.7.2.10 Given the above guidelines for determining suitability, the Contractor should be able to determine, without DOJ involvement, which applicants are unsuitable for employment under this contract.  However, additional questions and requests for information may result from review of the security packages by DOJ personnel.  In the event the Department or the contractor has reasonable cause to believe that an employee under the BPA falls under any of the eleven mandatory disqualification factors listed above, the employee must be removed from this BPA.  In addition, all contract employees are expected to adhere to the Department's Standards of Conduct.

4.7.2.11 The COTR will notify the Contractor of the results of background investigations as they are completed and adjudicated.  The COTR will also notify the Contractor of any applicants who are found ineligible for employment under this contract so that the Contractor can immediately recruit and initiate paperwork to clear replacement applicants.  If a contract employee is already working on the BPA and is determined to be ineligible, he or she will be removed from the call order.

4.7.212 The COTR will notify the Contracting Officer when a sufficient number of Contractor employees have received employment security approvals or pre-appointment waivers approvals.  Upon receipt of this information and any other information, which may be required elsewhere in the BPA, the Contracting Officer will issue the Contractor a Notice to Proceed, which permits the commencement of work under the call(s).

4.7.2.13 The Contractor shall ensure no contract or subcontract employee commences performance hereunder prior to receipt of a written authorization from the Contracting Officer.

4.7.2.14 The Contractor shall make every effort to preclude incurrence of costs by the Government for security investigations for replacement of employees, and in so doing shall ensure otherwise satisfactory and physically able employees assigned hereunder remain in contract performance for at least one year.  The Contractor shall take all necessary steps to assure contract or subcontract personnel selected for assignment to this contract are professionally qualified and personally reliable, of reputable background and sound character, and meet all other requirements stipulated herein.  The fact the Government performs security investigations shall not in any manner relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to ensure that all personnel furnished are reliable and of reputable background and sound character.  Should a security investigation conducted by the Government render ineligible a Contractor-furnished employee, the Contracting Officer will investigate the cause and determine whether the Contractor has abdicated his responsibility to make every effort to select reliable employees of reputable background and sound character.  Should there be a need to replace a contract or subcontract employee due to non-performance, the Contracting Officer will determine whether the Contractor has abdicated his responsibilities to make every effort to select trained and experienced employees.

4.7.2.15  Should the Contracting Officer determine the Contractor has failed to comply with the terms of paragraph above, the Contractor may be held monetarily responsible, at a minimum, for all reasonable and necessary costs incurred by the Government to (a) provide coverage (performance) through assignment of individuals employed by the Government or third parties in those cases where absence of contract personnel would cause either a security threat or DOJ program disruption, and (b) conduct security investigations in excess of those which would otherwise be required.  

4.7.2.16 Nothing in this clause shall require the Contractor to bear costs involved in the conduct of security investigations for replacement of an employee who becomes deceased or severely ill for a long period of time.

4.7.2.17 Under no circumstances shall the Contractor fail to comply with the terms and conditions set forth herein without assuming liability for such failure as may be established pursuant to this clause.  The rights and remedies conferred upon the Government by this clause are in addition to all and other rights and remedies specified elsewhere in this contract or established by law.

4.7.3	Protection of Grand Jury Information

4.7.3.1 Grand jury testimony is sensitive Limited Official Use information, which must be protected against disclosure to unauthorized personnel.  Pursuant to Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedures, disclosures of matters occurring before the grand jury other than its deliberations and the vote of any juror may be made available to the attorneys for the Government to use in the performance of their duties.  Otherwise a juror, attorney, interpreter, stenographer, or operator of a recorded testimony may disclose matters occurring before the grand jury only when so directed by the court.

4.7.3.2 It shall be the duty of the Official Reporter to safeguard all materials relating to grand jury hearings, which are in his/her possession and/or under his/her custody.  The USA may at his/her discretion retain custody of the material, including notes, tapes, drafts, etc., and require all transcribing and typing of the grand jury information be done within the USAO.

4.7.3.3 The Contractor shall hold inviolate and in the strictest confidence any and all information of an official character which he/she may gain in the performance of his/her duties under this agreement.  The Contractor shall not divulge, sell, or distribute any information gained at a grand jury proceeding, except as authorized by the presiding official. 

 
	
4.7.4	Contractor Physical Security Requirements

4.7.4.1 Contractor employees assigned to work areas where Grand Jury information is processed, stored, or transcribed must challenge the presence of any unknown or unauthorized person.  The need-to-know principle shall be adhered to at all times within the closed area.  When the materials are not stored in security containers or vaults, and when in actual use by authorized personnel, they shall be protected as follows:
o	Kept under constant surveillance by an authorized person who is in a physical position to exercise direct security controls over the material. 
o	Covered, turned face down, placed in storage containers, or otherwise protected when unauthorized persons are present. 
o	The room containing the materials must be locked when vacated for short periods of time. 
o	Returned to storage containers as soon as practicable after use. Grand jury material shall not be removed from the premises of the court reporter for transcription except for delivery to the USAOs. Approved storage containers include: the GSA Class 6 security container; a lock-bar file cabinet (with a GSA approved lock); or 3-position dial safe. 

4.7.4.2 SPS will fund the security system required for this action.

4.7.4.3   End-of-day security checks shall be performed within the contract facility to ensure that precautions are taken to protect grand jury material. The court reporter firm shall designate an individual or individuals, to make daily checks to ensure all grand jury material has been properly stored. This can be the Grand Jury Court Reporter personnel, or another individual who has been granted security approval by the EOUSA SPS.

4.7.4.4   The Contracting Officer or his/her authorized representative, of the USAO, shall have the right to inspect at reasonable intervals, but at least annually, the procedures, equipment, and facilities used by the Contractor to comply with these requirements.

The information must be unclassified. All processing must be done on removable storage media (floppy disks, CDs, removable hard drives, cartridges). Removable storage media must be marked "Grand Jury Information." When marking the media, no acronyms should be used. 

4.7.5.3 In addition, any Information Technology equipment used to process USAO information may be subject to certification/accreditation and/or disk-based sanitization to protect grand jury information. As a general rule, grand jury court reporters may not use personally-owned PCs and equipment to process grand jury information. Personally-owned PCs and equipment are those devices the grand jury court reporter uses to conduct personal projects related to obligations, affairs, assets, or life of the operator.

4.7.5.4 When grand jury court reporter owned PCs are used, and/or have fixed hard drives, and the PC is also used for transcription work outside of the USAO, the equipment must have the ability to download to USAO equipment or storage media. In addition, temporary files must be deleted from the grand jury court reporters equipment using the currently approved USAO sanitization method. 

4.7.5.5 Access to information technology equipment must be controlled and restricted to personnel authorized to handle grand jury information and having appropriate access approval. Unauthorized personnel must not be permitted to view any grand jury information. The equipment must be turned off, or otherwise disabled, when not in use.

4.7.5.6 The removable media must be stored in an approved security container or lockable file cabinet (in accordance with 6.C.1) after normal working hours or when the equipment is not in use. 

4.7.5.7 All printed output material must be protected. USAO personnel must ensure this requirement is adhered to and documented in the Grand Jury Inspection Reports. 

4.7.5.8 Only appropriately-cleared maintenance personnel escorted and monitored by USAO personnel or court reporter service personnel are allowed to perform on-site maintenance for the equipment. The USAO must grant approval before maintenance of the PC is allowed. The storage media must be removed from the PC prior to removal of the PC from the area for maintenance. 

4.7.5.9 Grand jury information should be backed up on a weekly basis. Grand jury information may not be processed by individuals outside of those contracted and granted security approval.

1.2 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

The Department of Justice may award multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) resulting from this Request for Quotation.  A Contractor may be eliminated based on its prices, in comparison to other Contractors prices.  The Government may also eliminate a Contractor based on Contractors past performance history and failure to provide documentation necessary to verify the acceptability of their court reporters.  A Contractor shall provide the additional information listed below:  

1.2.1	Qualifications of Proposed Staff  The Government reserves the right to request at any time the professional qualifications of Contractor personnel.  This information will be used to ascertain the depth of relevant requisite training, skills and professional certification of personnel.  

1.2.2	Past Performance  Provide (3) references for commensurate projects that are in progress or were completed within the last three (3) years.  If a Contractor will be using a subcontractor, three (3) references must be provided for the subcontractor as well.  References may be from commercial and federal/state Government contracts; however, similar support services performed for Federal Government customers generally will be considered more relevant than those done for commercial or state government customers.  The following information is required for each reference:

o	Customer name and address.
o	Point of contact (name, title, telephone number, and fax number) for contractual/administrative matters (e.g., Contracting Officer) and technical performance (e.g., Contracting Officers Technical Representative).
o	Contract/Task Order number.

E.2 Evaluation Criteria

DOJ may award up to two (2) awards as a result of this solicitation.  

E.2.1 Evaluation criteria:
The Government will evaluate prospective contractors past performance and price in making an award decision.

3.1.1	Past Performance -- Past Performance is a measure of the degree to which a Contractor, as an organization, has satisfied its customers.  The EOUSA will           check each contractors client references to inquire about (1) the quality and timeliness of the vendors work; (2) reasonableness of its business behavior; and, (3) technical and management capabilities.  The EOUSA will attempt to check the references provided by the contractor, particularly commensurate tasks, and may expand the evaluation to include references not contained in the vendors submission.  The actual number of references checked is entirely at the EOUSAs discretion.

3.1.2   Price - The Government intends to make BPA/contract award(s) to the offerors whose proposal represents the best value to the Government. The evaluation of price will be based on the Government estimate of quantities and the offerors total price.  If the Government determines that there are significant differences in technical merit among competing proposals, then a more expensive proposal may be selected for award where the Government determines that the value of the selected proposal is worth the price differential.

Each vendors price proposal will be evaluated to assess the reasonableness of proposed prices. This evaluation will be based on the information and supporting data provided in the proposal and its compatibility with the evaluation factors identified above. 

In making this determination, the Government is more concern with obtaining performance capability superiority rather than overall price.

D. 3 Continuing Contract Performance During a Pandemic Influenza or other National 
         Emergency 


Continuing Contract Performance During a Pandemic Influenza
or other National Emergency

During a Pandemic or other emergency we understand that our contractor workforce will experience the same high levels of absenteeism as our federal employees. Although the Excusable Delays and Termination for Default clauses used in government contracts list epidemics and quarantine restrictions among the reasons to excuse delays in contract performance, we expect our contractors to make a reasonable effort to keep performance at an acceptable level during emergency periods. 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has provided guidance to federal managers and employees on the kinds of actions to be taken to ensure the continuity of operations during emergency periods. This guidance is also applicable to our contract workforce. Contractors are expected to have reasonable policies in place for continuing work performance, particularly those performing mission critical services, during a pandemic influenza or other emergency situation. 

The types of actions a federal contractor should reasonably take to help ensure performance are: 

	Encourage employees to get inoculations or follow other preventive measures as advised by the public health service. 

	Contractors should cross-train workers as backup for all positions performing critical services. This is particularly important for work such as guard services where telework is not an option. 

	Implement telework to the greatest extent possible in the workgroup so systems are in place to support successful remote work in an emergency. 

	Communicate expectations to all employees regarding their roles and responsibilities in relation to remote work in the event of a pandemic health crisis or other emergency. 

	Establish communication processes to notify employees of activation of this plan. 

	Integrate pandemic health crisis response expectations into telework agreements. 

	With the employee, assess requirements for working at home (supplies and equipment needed for an extended telework period). Contract Security requirements must be considered in making equipment choices; agencies or contractors may wish to avoid use of employees' personal computers and provide them with PCs or laptops as appropriate. 

	Determine how all employees who may telework will communicate with one another and with management to accomplish work. 

	Practice telework regularly to ensure effectiveness.


	Make it clear that in emergency situations, employees must perform all duties assigned by management, even if they are outside usual or customary duties. 

	Identify how time and attendance will be maintained. 

It is the contractor's responsibility to advise the government contracting officer or COTR if they anticipate not being able to perform and to work with the Department to fill gaps as necessary. This means direct communication with the contracting officer, COTR or in his/her absence, another responsible person in the contracting office via telephone or email messages acknowledging the contractors notification. The incumbent contractor is responsible for assisting the Department in estimating the adverse impacts of nonperformance and to work diligently with the Department to develop a strategy for maintaining the continuity of operations. 

The Department does reserve the right in such emergency situations to use federal employees, employees of other agencies, contract support from other existing contractors, or to enter into new contracts for critical support services. Any new contracting efforts would be acquired following the guidance in the Office of federal Procurement Policy issuance "Emergency Acquisitions", May, 2007 and Subpart 18.2 Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.

<DESC>RECOVERY--RECOVERY--Under this topic, the Government invites proposals for projects to explore the further development of efficient, high temperature SiC power electronics to be used in military vehicles that encompass hybrid electric mobility and power generation systems. The government desires SiC power electronics that can operate with coolant inlet temperatures at 100C or higher. Increased coolant temperatures increase cooling efficiency and allow for reduced cooling system size. The power electronics developed must use the SiC power semiconductors to maximize efficiency, power density (kW/liter) and specific power (kW/kg), while maintaining or improving power converter reliability. The corresponding reductions in size and weight for the cooling system and the electrical power converter, along with increased cooling efficiency and power conversion efficiency will make vehicle electric and hybrid electric power systems smaller, lighter and more fuel-efficient.<BR><BR>Estimated Maximum Government funding available for Topic #20 is $12.15M. The Government reserves the right to award part or all of an offerors proposal resulting in one or multiple contracts (for various amounts, but the sum of multiple contract awards shall not exceed $12.15M) that may address one or more or all of the Power Converter Types listed in the attachment at subparagraph 2.b of the Description section.<BR><BR>The topic was amended on 08 Jun 2009 to include footnotes to the Power Converter Types to provide additional details.

This Request for Quotation (HSCG38-09-Q-200144) incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-33. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), the U.S. Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) plans to solicit and negotiate a firm fixed price contract on a sole source basis with Hawker Pacific, or a responsible contractor who can provide a Certificate of Conformance with traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the overhaul of the items listed below. The OEM is MESSIER-DOWTY SA. However, all responsible contractors may submit an offer.  The contractor shall furnish a Certificate of Conformance in accordance with FAR Clause 52.246-15 and in the format specified in the clause. Traceability means that the awardee must be able to provide a clear, documented, auditable paper trail for ownership and transfer of each part from the OEM to the final vendor.

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;

(g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 

(End of provision)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. 

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC><p>30 Jun 09: Correction of RFI SS_A8MC_FA4890-06-29-09</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reference in the RFI regarding the requirement to use "one of two Solution Data Input Workbook Templates provided as Attachments" is changed to reflect the use of only one template (Attach 1 only).</p>
<p>In addition, "Attachment 2" is now held in reserve and shall not be utilized.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason for this amendment is that no Government Agencies are expected to respond to this RFI, so only Industry should provide responses and should respond using Attach 1.</p>
<p>All other instructions and the time/date for responses remain the same.</p>

<p>Justification for other than full and open competition is considered due to the fact that GE's Wave BioReactor is the only system that can perform our requirements for the insect cell culture at a large volume and is designed to be used on bench top, which allows the system to be used in an open environment and doesn't occupy a large space which is ideal for limited amounts of lab space. Note 22 applies herein. The statutory authority permitting other-than-full-and-open competition is 41 U.S.C., 253(c)(1): FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract will be based on responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for informational purposes. This procurement is not set-aside for small business.

<DESC>Amendment A001 issued to add a description of boxes to be procurred under subsequent contract.

This requirement is 100% set-aside for competition among small businesses.
A technical, as well as cost, evaluation will be conducted to determine "Best Value" to the FAA.  A description of the technical submittal and subsequent evaluation can be found in Sections L and M of the Screening Information Request/Request for Offer (SIR/RFO).
It is anticipated that an Indefinite-Delivery/Requirements type contract with Time-and-Material pricing arrangements will be awarded as a result of this SIR/RFO.  The contract will consist of one 1-year base period, plus four 1-year option periods.    
ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SIR/RFO AND SOW MUST BE RECEIVED PRIOR TO JULY 13, 2009 FOR ANSWERS TO BE PROVIDED BEFORE THE PROPOSALS ARE DUE.
Contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration, www.ccr.gov on the date established for receipt of offers, July 23, 2009.

In addition, all contractors shall complete and return the attached Business Declaration Form with their proposals. The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each offeror's program eligibility.
Technical and cost proposals must be received by the FAA, no later than 2:00 p.m. CST, Wednesday, July 23, 2009.  Any responses received after that date and time will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined ineligible.
Hand-delivered responses will need to allow sufficient time to process through security procedures in place at the Aeronautical Center.  Overnight delivery of responses to this SIR/RFO could also be impacted if not sent in sufficient time to allow for special mail handling procedures in place at the Aeronautical Center.
Potential offerors should note that the FAA reserves the right to communicate with one or more offerors at any time during the solicitation process.

____________________________6/11/09Amendment 1:  Answers to Questions
1)I have a quick question regarding notice # N40085-09-R-0206, and I was hoping that you could help me.  By any chance is this requirement a follow-on to contract # N40085-05-R-1005?  This requirement is not a follow-on contract.
2) Is there a page limit for the SF 330 submittal?  No.
3)  Can you please confirm that the due date for submittals is July 10, 2009?  Within the text of the solicitation (bottom of page 3) it states that all responses are due by May 30, 2008.  The synopsis has been revised to read the correct date, submittals are due July 10, 2009 at 2:00 p.m.
____________________________6/22/2009Amendment 2:  Answers to Questions
4)In the evaluation Factor #4, it requires an explanation on the company's ability to perform 5 taskings simultaneously. Could you please clarify the work load each tasking would entail.  In other words, what is the assigned value of each task order. For the purposes of this evaluation factor, use a task order range of $15,000 to $150,000 to estimate the workload.
5)I am writing to inquire about the IDIQ for A/E Services for Projects at Military Installations in the NAVFAC Midlant Public Works Department Little Creek and Oceana Areas?  Is cost estimating considered a part of the team?  Yes.
____________________________6/24/2009Amendment 3:  Answers to Questions
6)The Solicitation indicates the NAICS Code 541310 - Architectural Services.  Our Firm carries Code 541330 - Engineering Services.  Does this difference in the NAICS Code hinder us from submitting our SF 330?  No it does not.  You are still eligible to submit your SF 330 for this procurement.


____________________________6/30/2009Amendment 4:  Answers to Questions
7)Does the prime need to contract for 50% of the contract dollars? Pursuant to FAR Part 19, at least 50 percent of the contract cost must be performed by the prime contractor's own employees. 
8)If we need to, but can't reach 50% as prime, can other small businesses on the contract like structural and civil count toward getting there?  Refer to previous question.
9)If other small businesses can't count, can we create a joint-venture?  You may create a joint venture.
10)Can the joint-venture be finalized after award, or does it need to be existing?  The joint venture must be in place prior to submission of your proposal for evaluation purposes.
11)When doing a joint-venture, does the small business cap look at each firm's revenue independently, or does it total them?	Refer to FAR Part 19.101 for determining the size standard.
12)Can the Organizational Chart be submitted on a single 11 x 17 fold-out?  It is difficult to get the org chart to fit on 8.5 x 11 and stay readable.  Yes.

<DESC>Recovery Action:  This action is assigning a Work Authorization KB/NS50/9/ARRA-1, funded with Recovery Act dollars under the referenced M&O contract (Contractor DUNS Number 785627931).  The work authorization scope of work covers:  Revitalize the US Nuclear Data Center, Specifically LLNS will develop new code framework and modern XENDL data format to replace legacy tools.  The contractor will be working on code for a database program at Lawrence Livermore.  

The work authorization is priced as an Other than Fixed Price action.  In accordance with FAR 5.705(b), the rationale for pricing this action Other than Fixed Price is due to the fact that LLNS operates under a cost re-imbursement  M&O contract and all costs are fully recovered.   The other basis for Other than Fixed Price is because this is a Research and Development type work authorization and is therefore cost-reimbursable.

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>MODIFICATION TO EXISTING CONTRACT TASK ORDER - The Kansas City District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has awarded a task order modification using American Recovery and ReinvestmentAct (ARRA) funds on contract W912DQ-08-D-0018. This project was originally competed under solicitation number W912DQ-08-R-0048 and awarded to CDM Federal Programs Corporation (CAGE: 0T3N7). This task order modification award is in the amount of $4,399,961.00.<BR><BR>Procurement of a Cost Plus Fixed-Fee Task Order was selected as the best method due to the significant flexibility required to respond to the conditions of this work.  The nature of the work being performed in the field involves a large amount of uncertainty in areas such as drilling depth and sample analysis.  There are also unknowns that the contractor will need to address, such as the volume and composition of IDW.  <BR><BR>The field team will be required to coordinate closely with USACE to make decisions for how to proceed on an almost daily basis.  Additionally, the USACE project team is capable and prepared to provide monitoring of contractor performance to mitigate risks and to ensure that all alternatives have been considered.  The project team is also able and has experience to monitor the task order to ensure that performance, cost and schedule goals are being met, including but not limited to:  implementing quality assurance procedures established for the contract, and completing timely contractor performance evaluations that accurately reflect the contractors actual performance.  <BR>

<DESC><p>COMPETITION IN CONTRACTING ACT (CICA)<br />JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. IDENTIFICATION OF AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:<br />The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is delegated the authority by GSA for this acquisition under FMR Guide 2008-B1. A real property lease contract for a port support space and ship berthing space for a 240 foot long research vessel in Rhode Island. The Office of Marine and Aviation Operations require facilities to support an oceanic research mission conducted jointly by the Office of Atmospheric Research and the University of Rhode Island at Narragansett. This action is being contracted by the Real Property Management Division under a March 28, 2008 delegation of authority from General Services Administration.</p>
<p>2. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED:<br />National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is interested in leasing approximately 8280 ANSI/BOMA rentable square feet of Class A office space, workshop and warehouse. The term is to be 10 year firm with options for up to a 15 year term with negotiable termination rights by the Government and all appropriate contact clauses. The Government has a requirement for a port support space to meet the mission needs of operating a large research vessel, performing pre and post cruse logistical support and to store, maintain, and perform equipment repairs as needed to operate manned and unmanned submersible craft used to collect data and samples of undersea environmental media.</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET AGENCY'S NEEDS, INCLUDING ESTIMATED VALUE:<br />NOAA requires the delivery of an integrated port facility consisting of: Office space 1200 rsf; Warehouse 2400 rsf; Special space (technical shop space) 4200 rsf; Hazmat Storage 480 rsf; Outside parking 30 spaces; Wareyard 0.25 acres (minimum of 2000 sf paved); Large Boat Pier with at least 250 linear feet of berthing area.<br />4. IDENTIFICATION OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:<br />41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) &#8208; only one responsible source responded to the solicitation.</p>
<p>5. DEMONSTRATION THAT PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS REQUIRES USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED:<br />Although four sites were identified as potential sites during a homeporting study for the RV Bigelow, a ship of the same class, and two brokers expressed interest verbally or by e-mail interest in responding to the initial request for interest, and only QDC responded in writing on January 30, 2008. A market survey, April 25, 2008, noted that two pier sites, controlled by the QDC can meet the ship berthing requirement and there is sufficient space in existing buildings to meet the facility requirements.</p>
<p>6. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS WERE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS PRACTICABLE:<br />The RV Bigelow homeporting study identified four as potential sites in the North Kingstown, RI area and seven in Providence, RI two years prior to this acquisition (list is attached). An RFI FBO Advertisement was made on January 10, 2008. Explanation of project was provided to two brokers John Capomaccio (independent Broker), and Nancy Vander Lugt of JDL Castle Corporation. They were also provided information for responding to the RFI and forms needed for response to solicitation. FBO Solicitation provided to all preliminarily interested parties</p>
<p>7. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE:<br />The QDC is a not for profit entity that was created by the State of Rhode Island to reuse and revitalize the Quonset Point Naval Air Station that was closed prior to the enactment of the Base Closure and Revitalization program in the Department of Defense. As such it is required to pass through only its costs and overhead. I have reviewed the proposal and subsequent analysis and have concluded that the proposed rental costs are fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>8. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET SURVEY CONDUCTED AND RESULTS:<br />The QDC was visited on April 25, 2008. It possessed two 1500 foot piers with access to either side giving over 6000 LF of berthing area. This is a commercial port with existing fully implemented port security. The port is used by several foreign car manufacturers as a disembarkation point for motor vehicles for distribution in Eastern North America. The pier meets current fire protection standards. A bulkhead perpendicular to the southern pier has been replaces and affords additional berthing points. The port has several existing warehouse facilities that are adjacent (1250 ft) to the piers. These facilities have 20,000 gsf bays with attached office/restroom areas that can be renovated to meet NOAA's requirements as well as energy star ratings. <br />To the south of the QDC port is another large pier. It has been leased by QDC to a marine construction company and is not available.<br />To the south of QDC is the URI pier was visited. Although long enough, it does not have sufficient water depth nor capacity of utilities and supports smaller research vessels. It also lacks building space. <br />Commercial Fishing pier to the north of QDC lacks pier space and building space.</p>
<p>9. OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:<br />There are three significant facts that limit competition. The availability of existing Piers with sufficient space, strength requirements, minimum deck to pier height differentials and minimum depth at low tide limit the total number of sites possible within the ship's homeporting area is limited by geography and bathymetry. The high initial cost and developmental hurdles that require to be crossed prior to delivery. And the need to be in proximity to the University of Rhode Island, a Joint Institute research partner and primary researchers for the mission of ships that will dock at the pier. QDC is also proposing a flat rent with no escalation of operating cost. It is controlling the variability in operating costs by netting them from the lease.</p>
<p>10. LISTING OF SOURCES THAT EXPRESSED A WRITTEN INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION:<br />Quonset Development Corporation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />11. CONTRACTING OFFICER CERTIFICATION:<br />To the best of my knowledge and belief, I certify that this justification is accurate and complete.</p>
<p>Approved by:</p>
<p>Andrew C. Duran<br />Real Property Contracting Officer</p>
<p>September 10, 2008<br />Date<br />&emsp;</p>
