OPM seeks assistance in: a) developing a written program design that reflects specific provisions and procedures for flexible spending accounts, including definition of services to be provide by the Third Party Administrator (TPA); b) identifying and collecting general information/data needed for a Request for Proposal (RFP); c) assisting in developing a bidder list; d) drafting the RFP for the TPA; e) providing technical program guidance during the procurement process for the selection of the TPA; f) analyzing proposals received; g) conducting finalist interviews; h) conducting finalist on-site visits and preparing a review report; i) reviewing final offers and advising OPM on contract selection; j) assisting with implementation of the program.

No other providers have been identified that meet the standards as developed by OPM. Segal has gained a unique working knowledge, from two prior OPM contracts, of the complex issues of the Federal System pertaining to the flexible spending accounts and the development of the structure of the TPA RFP document.  It would take another vendor (if one could be found) a significant amount of time to gain the knowledge that this contractor has amassed in order to meet the basic requirements.  Companies that can met the above described requirements should submit complete technical information and representative pricing that demonstrates their ability to provide the types of services described above to Ms. Christine L. Sihag, OPM Contracting Officer at FAX: (202) 606-0910, or email: csihag@opm.gov.  Proposals are due no later than close of business (3:00 p.m. EST) on June 17, 2002.  No solicitation will be issued as a result of this notice.  This notice is for the purpose of determining if sources other than the Segal Company can meet our requirements.  The government will not pay for the information provided.  A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of OPM.

This procurement will be conducted on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.

The Navy expects to issue the job order under the above numbered bas ic ordering agreement with Raytheon Company, Fort Wayne.  Delivery is required to begin within 270 days from the effective date of award.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The Office of Minority Health (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with The Office of Minority Health, Arkansas Department of
Health, Little Rock, Arkansas. 
Purpose: 
The state of Arkansas is largely rural composed of a majority of people from Europe 80 percent, African American decent 16 percent, and a small population of people of Hispanic origin 4 percent.  Arkansas, in general, consistently remains one of the unhealthiest states in the country.  Tobacco use and diseases related to tobacco use are a primary cause of health disparities in the state.
As in the Nation, health issues related to the impact of tobacco have not received adequate attention in Arkansas.  There are many programs that concentrate on categorical health needs, but did not evaluate the overall health status or disproportionate impact from lung cancer, the fourth highest rate for death directly attributed to smoking.  Adults in Arkansas use tobacco at a rate of 26 percent and has some of the highest rates for African American, women, and youth compared to national statistics.
The Office of Minority Health, in conjunction with the Center for Health Training and community partners are sponsoring a "Minority Summit on Tobacco" August 29-30, 2002.  The planning committee consists of Arkansas Department of Health colleagues from the six health areas targeted by Healthy People 2010, and the organizations represented in the tobacco initiative: League for Latin American Citizens, University of Arkansas- Pine Bluff and Arkansas Medical Dental Pharmaceutical.  The purpose of this summit is to provide the Department of Health colleagues and community partners a comprehensive overview of tobacco's impact on minority populations and strategies to address this national health issue.
The Minority Summit on tobacco will be a two-day event scheduled for August 29-30 on the University of Arkansas Pine Bluff's campus.  An anticipated 450 Arkansas Department of Health colleagues, and community partners will attend this Summit.  The activity offers a unique opportunity to reach providers and caregivers.
Speakers identified for the Summit will be supported by the contractor.  They will offer a broad comprehensive perspective on smoking and its impact on minority populations.  The Summit will have plenary and breakout sessions.
It is the goal of the planning committee to include community participation throughout the State.  Arkansas is a very rural State, and transportation is limited.  The contract will support the participation of community/regional colleagues; a media campaign; and development of proceedings of the Summit.
THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND		
NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 6.302. 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO
RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 7 DAYS
AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY
THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED
ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN
THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL
NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING
WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>This procurement is for a 3080L electrostatic classifier, and associated control software (Aerosol Instrument Manager Software AIM 3936).  The classifier and, Item 2: software will form an integral part of a system for measuring the size of ultra-fine particles, and will be interfaced with an existing modular classifier and mobility analyzer system.  The system will allow reference measurements to be made of aerosol surface area, and will form the basis of developing a portable ultra-fine particle size distribution measurement instrument.  Compatibility with existing equipment is essential for the use to which the classifier will be put.  This necessitates purchasing the classifier from the manufacturer of the existing equipment.  This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $50,000.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The Technology:
This technology provides the capability to do high resolution imaging of biological materials for protein content and position within a two-dimensional nanoscale sized sample, as well as increase the through-put of nanoscale sample matrices. The system allows for sub-micron laser desorption/ionization in vacuo to the rear of the MALDI-MS sample stage. This in turn allows for multiple, independent sampling from various areas of single micron- or submicron-size samples.  In addition, the small ?pixel? size provided by this approach allows one to generate nanometer-scaled two-dimensional high resolution MALDI-MS ?protein images? of a biological sample, such as cell structures (e.g., membranes; organelles). The system can also create correlated optical images of the ionized submicron sample region.  The system has demonstrated the ability to detect peptide concentrations in small samples at levels well above the minimum detectable concentration range reported previously.
Note:   THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.   Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company?s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

<DESC>The Office of Minority Health (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with The Office of  Multicultural Health, Oregon Health Division,
Portland, Oregon.
Purpose:The Nursing Shortage Demonstration Project was conceived and developed by the Oregon Office of Multicultural Health in response to a continuing and growing disparity in the number of minority nurses available to provide culturally appropriate health care to an increasing diverse general population.  The disparity has been documented in a number of recent studies by nursing professionals, administrators, and educators in the health care arena.  Specific reports from the Governor's Task Force on Racial and Ethnic Health and Oregon Nursing Leadership Council indicate the need for more bilingual and bicultural health care professionals.  Currently, the percent of minority registered nurses (RN) in Oregon is 5.9 compared to a racial/ethnic minority population of 16 percent.
The objective of this project is to increase the number of bilingual/ bicultural workers in the nursing profession to more closely mirror the population that the health care system serves.  The concept provides for health care employers to identify current high performing "incumbent" bilingual/ bicultural workers from their paraprofessional staff who would have the ability, motivation, and support to participate in a specialized nurse training program uniquely designed to meet their needs.  In effect, the concept would allow workers to retain their full time employment status while participating in the training program.
THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND		
NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 6.302. 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO
RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 7 DAYS
AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY
THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED
ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN
THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL
NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING
WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

<CONTACT>DENIS S. THARP, Contract Specialist, Phone: (513) 487-2092, E-Mail: Tharp.Scott@epa.gov
<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13 and FAR Part 12, the EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (Ann Arbor, Michigan) is in need of a portable on-vehicle emissions measurement system within six (6) months of award, that independently quantifies total oxides of nitrogen (NOx); carbon monoxide (CO); carbon dioxide (CO2); total hydrocarbons (THC); non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC); fuel-air ratio (l); exhaust flow rate; fuel economy; ambient and exhaust temperatures, pressures; relative humidity; CAN/ECM signals; GPS signals and the ability to simultaneously measure emission concentrations from two different locations of the exhaust (i.e. upstream and downstream of exhaust after-treatment systems). EPA's performance goal is that each of these parameters be quantified at 1 Hz by exhaust mass rate, g/kg of fuel consumed, g/mile, and g/hp-hr.  EPA's accuracy goal is ?10% with 95% confidence on brake-specific (g/hp-hr) and distance-specific (g/mi) bases as compared to simultaneous certified laboratory results over the full range of steady state and transient engine operation. EPA will consider a single unit applicable to diesel and gasoline engine applications.  However, EPA recognizes that diesel and gasoline engines emit very different concentrations of emissions and that lean (diesel) and stoichiometric (gasoline) exhausts might require different emissions measurement technologies.  EPA will consider responses that propose alternatives to a single unit solution.  Such solutions might include a single unit  with modular components that can be added or removed depending upon a diesel or gasoline application.  Another possible solution would be two complete, but separate systems: one for gasoline and one for diesel.  The portable on-vehicle emissions measurement system will be subject to EPA evaluation prior to acceptance.  The evaluation will determine the effort required to prepare and maintain the system for testing exhaust emission from vehicles and engines, to collect simultaneous emissions and activity data during laboratory testing using CFR analytical procedures for purposes of correlation analysis, to simulate in the field laboratory driving schedules, to correlate road and lab data and field test the system over a sufficient period of time and range of operation to judge its durability and data quality.  The system will also be compared to EPA's ROVER system during real-world in-use driving conditions.  Only after passing the EPA Evaluation will the system be acceptable to EPA. The successful offeror must be able to provide nationwide on-site support, service and training in order to maximize the system's utility.  EPA requires that at a minimum the company provide expert telephone support during normal business hours and provide complete repair or replacement of any failed components within five (5) business days of reporting a problem. This award will require the delivery of two (2) systems with each system capable of gasoline and diesel operation, plus any accessories that might be required to field-calibrate, operate, and maintain the systems. The portable on-vehicle emissions measurement system must be compact, and the attachment, connections, and packaging must ensure that the system will be non-intrusive and quickly installable and removable.  EPA requires that the system be sufficiently compact and self-contained such that installation may be completed by one person.  The total weight of the system must not exceed 100 pounds, excluding any externally detachable cables or sample lines.  The  system can consist of no more than two separate components, with each component not exceeding 50 pounds.  The component weights are exclusive of any externally detachable cables or sample lines.   The attachment of the system to the vehicle must be straightforward and it must require a minimal amount of tools or other hardware.  Connections to exhaust and engine components must be non-intrusive and low profile so that the system will not interfere with the operation of the vehicle.  Electrical connections must be able to withstand outdoor environments.  The attachment, connections, and packaging must be able to withstand vehicle shock and vibration and temperature changes on-vehicle.  The system also must be able to tolerate typical handling during installation and removal. Interested parties should submit a written request to receive the Statement of Work and RFQ (SF-1449) by close of business June 10, 2002, to Scott Tharp at the above address by Fax (513) 487-2107 or by e-mail Tharp.Scott@epa.gov.  Telephone requests will not be honored.  The RFQ and Statement of Work will be made available through the EPA website on June 11, 2002 at http:www./epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) intends to establish multiple, 5-year Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts for the development, revision, updating, and presentation nationwide of training courses. The Office of Freight Management and Operations anticipates the need to develop a number of courses dealing with freight transportation.  Special expertise specific to freight transportation is needed to develop and present these training courses.  Successful performance will require in depth knowledge regarding freight transportation issues in 6 of the following areas:  1) transportation planning and environment, 2) national security, 3) forecasting and trends, 4) economic benefits and cost benefit analysis, 5) performance measures, 6) financing projects, 7) operations strategies (including ITS Strategies, e-commerce, web based information etc.), 8) private and public sector partnering, 9) public outreach (public, public officials etc.), 10) intermodal freight transportation issues, 11) institutional issues, and 12) Logistics, and other related topics in freight.  Successful candidates may consist of one or more firms (a team) to meet the requirements of technical, research, practical, and academic knowledge and expertise. Contractors are strongly encouraged to show the ability to meet all subject matter areas, however, those who can meet at least 6 areas may be eligible for award.

  New course development and the updating of existing courses require the ability to incorporate sound technical content into acceptable adult learning instructional design.

It is anticipated that a combination of classroom courses (including computer based materials) and a number of distance learning (most notably, web-based training) products could be developed. Course presentations require highly qualified instructors. They must be experts in the subject matter, and employ adult learning techniques in the classroom. Successful candidates will compete for award of subsequent task orders. Such task orders may include other related functions such as needs assessment, marketing, electronic formatting and conference management.

"Registered in the CCR database" means that all mandatory information,
including the DUNS number or the Duns +4 number, if applicable, and the
corresponding Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, is in the CCR
database; the DUNS number and the CAGE code have been validated;  and all

<DESC>NOTE: This procurement is open ONLY to LAW FIRMS or SOLO practitioners of LAW licensed to practice law in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.

The contractors will be required to pursue debt collection activities which parallel existing industry procedures that have proven to be effective and efficient; to interact with government representatives at defined stages of the collection process (i.e., settlement, compromise, etc.); to input relevant case data in a computer base maintained by the government and/or provide reports required by the government.  Payment will be made by a combination of contingency fees and firm, fixed prices.  Law firms or solo practitioners who respond to this solicitation MUST be regularly engaged in the private practice of LAW within the federal District of Columbia.  "Regularly engaged in the private practice of law" is construed to mean that at least 20% of the debt collection cases handled by the offeror arise in the District of Columbia.  NOTE: The Act provides that the Department may contract ONLY with law firms or solo practitioners of law since contractors must represent the United States in court.  The government anticipates awarding up to three contracts (or more or less at the discretion of the government).  The period of performance for each contract will be one base year plus up to six optional years. 

The solicitation document will be available about July 5, 2002 and will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Electronic Posting System -- FedBizOpps.

<DESC>The US Army TACOM-ARDEC is developing a MEMS based S& A for use in the Objective Individual Combat Weapon (OICW) System, 20mm High Explosive Air Bursting (HEAB) munition.  This device will sense the dynamic conditions associated with gun launch and arm the projectile at the appropriate distance from the OICW gunner.  The device will also keep the fuze safe until arming is acceptable.  The US Army TACOM-ARDEC is planning to award a Sole Source contract to Alliant TechSystems located at Plymouth, Minnesota, the developers of the OICW system, to perform the test, evaluation and  integration of the MEMS S&A device in the OICW projectile.  This will  require the redesign and packaging of the OICW fuze, interfacing the MEMS device into the fuze and explosive training and conducting laboratory,  ballistic and fuze safety testing of the OICW projectile with MEMS S&A. It is anticipated that at least 4 iterations of MEMS S&A devices will be  tested in the OICW projectile.  An intimate knowledge of the OICW weapon, fire control, fuzing, explosive training and ballistic environment is  required to complete this work.  The projected time frame for completing  this work is 24 month after award of contract.  Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>NASA/JSC plans to issue a Request for Quote (RFQ) for ISS EXPRESS (Expedite the Proccessing of Experiments to Space Station) Racks that are compatible with Flight Quick Disconnects (QDs) and Documentation.  This fluid disconnects the JSC subrack payload equipment use with the ISS internal thermal control system via the EXPRESS Rack.  The EXPRESS Racks require that all QDs, which interface with EXPRESS satisfy specific geometric, performance and material requirements.    This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Parker Stratoflex. This recommendation is pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 (a)(ii), for the acquisition of supplies deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof.  Competition is impractical because Parker Stratoflex provides all fluid QDs on ISS to NASA specifications, therefore, fabrication of QDs by an alternate vendor would be cost prohibitive due to design requirements and would likely require patent licenses from Parker Symetrics.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 11, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) intends to modify, on a sole source basis, Contract HQ0006-01-C-0001 with The Boeing Company, to develop a Sea-Based Test X-band Radar (XBR) capability in support of the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) Program. This action will provide for the Sea-Based Test XBR capability design, development, acquisition of a sea-based platform, and modification of the platform and existing XBR to meet design requirements, integration and operational check-out, and radar test operations.  Currently, Boeing is providing development of initial components of the GMD system (interceptor, XBR, and upgrades to the Early Warning Radars) under this contract.  A sea-based platform for the Test XBR is required to support the expanded test operations of the GMD component of the Ballistic Missile Defense System Test Bed.  The effort necessary to satisfy this Sea-Based Test XBR capability is highly specialized and tightly interwoven with the on-going GMD development efforts being provided by Boeing.  No other source can meet this requirement without the intimate knowledge of, and the ability to provide the currently planned XBR element for installation on the sea-based platform and integration into the GMD system under this contract.  See numbered note 22.

<DESC>C--ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
(1) Anticipated Period of Performance: The program is anticipated to require a total of 42 months.  The offeror may propose an alternate duration, but duration must be commensurate with anticipated Government funding profile for the HSP program as defined in Paragraph C(4) of this PRDA.
(2) Expected Award Date: The estimated award date is 20 Sep 2002.
(3) Type of Contract: The Government anticipates awarding a single cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contract.
(4) Government Estimate: The total contract costs plus the penetrator Government test costs (in then-year dollars) to execute the entire program is estimated at $7.95M.  (Ref. Paragraph D(3) of this announcement). (NOTE --The Government anticipates that the HSP program then-year-dollars profile for funding available for the HSP contracted and penetrator testing effort will be as follows: FY02 - $0.854M, FY03 - $2.130M, FY04 - $2.630M, and FY05 - $2.336.  However, this statement shall not be interpreted as an obligation on the part of the Government to fund the HSP program at the stated annual levels.)  The contractor shall propose a distribution of these funds between the contract, testing and Government in the proposal.  Tests conducted at a government facility will be directly funded by AFRL/MNMI.  Some Government cost information is found in Annex 2.  To help reduce total costs for this program, the Government may determine that some proposed contract effort could be more economically executed using Government resources and may enter into negotiations to accomplish this objective.  Potential areas of negotiations include, but are not limited to, hydrocode analysis, cannon tests, certain types of explosive fills and scaled gun tests. 

(5) Government Furnished Property (GFP), Facilities and Test Support:  The offeror shall identify all government furnished resources (i.e., hardware, equipment, facilities and support) needed to execute the contract in a timely and cost effective manner.  The offeror's proposal shall reflect the use of the Holloman Sled Test Track facility and its associated support for the required test conditions identified in Annex 1.  The Government will also assist in providing other GFP or facilities as appropriate and based on availability, if requested by the contractor.  These facilities may include the Advance Warhead Experimentation Facility (AWEF), the Fuze facility, the Mass Property Measurement facility and the High Explosive Research & Development facility.  Therefore, the offeror shall forward a detailed list of Government resources wished to be included in the proposal to the PCO not later than ten (10) calendar days after the date of publication of this PRDA.  The Government will determine the availability of the government resources and then notify the contractor within twenty (20) calendar days after the receipt of the request, as to whether the request has been approved or disapproved.

(6) Size Status.  This acquisition is solicited under full and open competition.  The appropriate NAISC code is 541710 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.

(8)  Cost-Sharing Proposals-Proposals offering a cost sharing arrangement may not be considered for award.  

D--PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS: 

(1)  General:  Offerors should apply the restrictive notice prescribed in the provision at FAR 52.215-1 (e), Restriction on Disclosure and Use of Data, to trade secrets or privileged commercial and financial information contained in their proposals.  Proposal questions should be directed to the appropriate points of contact listed below.  Offerors should consider instructions contained in the AFRL BAA and PRDA Industry Guide.  The document may be viewed and downloaded at http://www.wrs.afrl.af.mil/contract/Ind-gde.rtf.  Technical and cost proposals, submitted in separate volumes, are required and must be valid for 180 days.  
Volume 1 should provide the technical proposal addressing the objective and requirements.  Volume 2, which must be unclassified, should address the price and cost details of the proposal.  

(2) Technical Proposal:  Volume I, the technical proposal shall include, as a minimum: a statement of work suitable for contract incorporation; and fully address the approach in accomplishing the Program tasking of Paragraph B(2).  Contractor must also provide a summary of relevant past and present performance.  Relevant past and present performance is defined as performance  by the proposed HSP program manager, lead technical investigator and/or chief engineer supporting ordnance programs within the last ten years, or past efforts by other key personnel proposed by the offeror for performance of this contract; state the capacity in which these individuals acted in these relevant programs.  In the technical proposal, the offeror shall propose and elaborate upon a specific HSP Point of Departure Design.  The offeror must provide sufficient technical discussion and technical detail to establish the soundness of the proposed approach; provide an adequate basis for assessing program technical cost and schedule risk; and form a sound basis for the cost proposed in Volume 2. To that end, the proposal shall address all aspects of the Point of Departure Design including but not limited to, case material selection; explosive fill selection; case, fuze, and explosive integration; penetrator predicted survivability; HSP depth of penetration calculated using the LaBombA code and impact conditions specified in Annex 1; and HSP mass properties.  The contractor shall disclose in the proposal proposed fuze modifications, if any.  (It is not the intent of the Government to encourage fuze design modifications.)  The proposal shall also identify and discuss the suitability of the various modeling and analysis tools that the contractor proposes to use during the HSP program to accomplish the HSP hardware design and effectiveness trades.  Proposals failing to provide adequate technical detail and discussion may be considered technically unresponsive to this PRDA. The technical proposal shall also include an overall test plan, with a supporting test matrix and discussion, which identifies all contractor and government conducted testing and the facilities at which the testing is to occur.  To facilitate timely completion of the pre-award surveys, offerors shall identify their own and subcontractor facilities and personnel, if any, to be involved in handling of explosives and other hazardous materials and the level of explosives/hazardous materials proposed.

(3) Cost Proposal:  Adequate price competition is anticipated.  The Volume 2 cost proposal must include and segregate the contract costs, and the Government test and equipment costs.  The contract costs shall include, as a minimum, a man-hour breakdown by task, a cost element summary including labor, overhead, travel, G&A, rates, etc. for the contract and data, and an expenditure schedule for the entire program.  The cost proposal shall include any proposed costs incurred by the fuze manufacturer in fulfilling their responsibilities to support integration and testing of their fuze.  It is anticipated that some of the work performed under the HSP contract will be classified.  The offeror should therefore, consider, and reflect in proposal, the cost impact that security will have on all aspects of proposed effort.  For the purpose of developing a test plan commensurate with the budget and contract costs, Annex 2 contains information to price Holloman sled tests, Davis Gun tests, testing at the AFRL/MN's AWEF and Fuze facilities, certain explosive fill which may be provided by the HERD facility, use of the 46 Test Wing Mass Property Measurement Facility, and cost of fuzes.  Be aware that AFRL/MNMI will be the customer for Government test agencies (i.e. AFRL/MNMI will be responsible for scheduling and coordinating test dates, requirements, test planning meetings, etc.)  The offeror shall include estimates for the cost of any other Government Furnished Property (GFP), and all costs incurred by the government that are associated with providing the equipment, facilities and support necessary to meet the contractor's testing requirements.  When requesting cost estimates for test support from Government test organizations, the offeror should clearly state that the Government program office, AFRL/MNMI, will make payment directly to the supporting Government test organization.  The Government will procure under a separate contract the fuzes as specified by the contractor (quantity and live or inert).  The $7.951M contract and test limit, as defined in Paragraph C(4) of this PRDA, shall include the cost of GFP.  Any costs associated with data rights and the total proposed costs associated with implementation of the TMATT tasking of Paragraph B(5) of this PRDA shall be separately identified in the cost proposal.  

(4) Page Limitations: Volume 1 shall be limited to a total of 75 pages, including  charts, figures, tables, etc. The proposed SOW, CDRLs, and resumes may be included as an appendix and will not be counted in the page limitations.  The Government reserves the right to remove and return to the offeror any excess pages before evaluation starts.  Cost proposals have no page limitations, however, the offeror is requested to keep the cost proposal to 50 pages as a goal.  A page is defined to be one side of an 8.5x11 inch piece of paper with information on it.  Minimum print size is 12 pitch, with line spacing of not less than one and one half for the typeface used (no more than 34 lines per page).  Proposals shall be submitted in an original and 5 copies.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal that shall be considered against the criteria set forth herein. Authorization for limited reproduction and dissemination within Government agencies and National Laboratories is requested by the Government and shall be addressed in the proposal.  

(5) Preparation Costs: The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract, or any other contract.  It is, however, an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Offerors are advised that only the Contracting Officer is legally authorized to contractually bind or otherwise obligate the Government.  The US Air Force reserves the right to award one or no contracts based on the proposals received in response to this announcement.  IAW FAR 19.702, a Small Business Subcontracting Plan will be requested from the offeror selected for award.  The plan must be submitted within 10 days after the request.   

(6) Data Rights:  The government is anticipating unlimited data rights to all data generated to include drawings and results.  The contractor is instructed to address data rights, licenses, etc. in the proposal.

E--Basis for Award:

Award Evaluation Criteria: The selection of none or one source for contract award will be based on evaluation of the proposals in response to this PRDA to determine the best value potential to the Government.  Proposals will be evaluated as received using the following factors and subfactors.  No other evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the best proposal.  Technical and Cost Factor information will be evaluated at the same time. The Technical Factor will be considered of higher priority than the Cost Factor. The subfactors under the Technical Factor, listed in decreasing order of importance, are: (a) Soundness of Technical Approach and Compliance with Requirements, (b) Understanding of the Problem, and (c) Relevant Past and Present Performance. 
The Soundness of Technical Approach and Compliance with Requirements will consider and evaluate the technical merits and risks as related to design, analysis, test planning, fabrication, and test support of the offeror's proposed HSP. It will also consider the potential of the proposed approach for meeting and/or exceeding the requirements identified in Annex 1 of this PRDA.  As a part of determining the best value potential for the entire program, the government will consider both the potential performance of the HSP Baseline Design and the contractor's proposed test plan.  A proposal which is deemed by the Government as meeting performance requirements and having the best potential for successfully demonstrating program objectives, without exceeding the maximum allowable cost specified in Paragraph C (4) of the PRDA, will be considered as offering higher potential value to the government.
Under the Cost Factor, the Cost Proposal will be evaluated for reasonableness and realism. The total cost to be evaluated will include the cost of performing the contract, the cost of testing the HSP, and any other offsets for GFP or acquisition of data rights.

<DESC>A--INTRODUCTION:  The Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate, Ordnance Integration Branch (AFRL/MNMI) is interested in receiving technical and cost proposals for the development and demonstration of a High Speed Penetrator (HSP) under this Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) number MNK-PRDA-02-0010.  This acquisition is unrestricted (i.e., considered full and open competition) except that only U.S. firms may submit offers as prime contractors.  Thus, all qualifying, responsible sources may submit a proposal that will be considered against the criteria set forth herein.  Firms responding to this solicitation should provide their business status as defined in FAR clause 52.219-1 for NAICS Code 541710 (500 people).  Proposals submitted must be in accordance with this announcement, and must be received no later than 3:00 p.m. Central Standard Time on 2 August 02.  Address proposals to AFRL/MNK, Attn: Jillian Pate, Building 13, Suite 337, 101 W. Eglin Blvd., Eglin AFB FL 32542-6810.  Reference solicitation number MNK-PRDA-02-0010 on the outside of the package.  Proposals received after the cut-off date/time specified herein shall be treated in accordance with FAR 52-215-1(c)(3), "Instructions to Offerors-Competitive Acquisition" (May 2001).  Proposals submitted must be in accordance with this announcement.  Since this is a PRDA, there will be no formal request for proposal or other solicitation regarding this announcement.  Offerors should be alert to any PRDA amendments that may be published.  The Government reserves the right to amend the due date to allow for subsequent submission-of-proposal dates. If a proposal is selected to satisfy the PRDA objectives as a result of the first submission, subsequent opportunities for proposal submission will not be available.  B--REQUIREMENTS: (1) Program Objective:  The overall HSP program objective is to develop an ordnance package with a payload, which survives a high speed impact into high strength, reinforced concrete and functions correctly afterwards. The method for demonstrating this ordnance package will be through sled tests.  (2) Technical Requirements and Goals:  The contractor's HSP design shall be based on the program objective and the requirements/goals described in Annex 1 of this PRDA.  The HSP shall, as a minimum, satisfy the performance requirements and strive to meet the performance goals.  The HSP shall be designed to survive and properly function after a high velocity impact into high strength reinforced concrete.  "Proper function" is stipulated as follows:  the integrated ordnance package survives the impact and penetration event intact; the fuze detonates in the manner for which it was designed; the explosive initiates and detonates due to fuze/booster function; the penetrator path through the media is predictable and stays within the target; the appropriate depth of penetration is achieved.  The penetrator will be evaluated through sled tests using concrete reinforced targets similar to the target description in Annex 2 of this PRDA.  (Note: Potential offeror's should forward their request for Annexes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of this PRDA to the Government in strict accordance with the requirements of Paragraph F(5) of this PRDA.) (3) Program Tasking:  This program is a technology demonstration of an integrated ordnance package for full scale testing and verification of survivability and function after a high velocity impact.  The contractor is to provide personnel, facilities, equipment and documentation to plan, organize, execute and manage these major tasks:  
(a) Design:  The contractor shall accomplish design of the HSP to survive and function after a high velocity impact event.  The fuze that shall be used for this effort is specified in Annexes 1 and 5.  The contractor shall identify case material, explosive fill, and components required to complete the integrated ordnance package.  The design must accommodate any internal instrumentation to be used in this program.  The contractor shall select case material that has the best chance of surviving impact and is low risk.  The contractor shall select an explosive having the best chance of surviving and providing the highest energetic capability.  (b) Analysis:  The contractor shall conduct simulations and analysis as necessary to predict/validate the expected survivability, proper function, stability within the target and depth of penetration of the HSP integrated ordnance package against the specified test targets.  (c) Test Planning:  The contractor is to develop and provide a test plan, a test schedule and cost estimate of testing to achieve the program objective and accomplish the minimum test conditions specified in Annex 1.  In addition to these tests, the contractor shall identify any government owned test facilities and commercial facilities required.  The test plan should achieve the program objective and requirements while minimizing risk, and providing the most data with respect to ordnance package performance.  The test plan may be a combination of scaled and full scale testing, but must be within the program budget and period of performance.  The contractor shall identify all data collection requirements, instrumentation or methodologies necessary to evaluate the performance of the HSP for each proposed test event.  Any instrumentation packages needed should be specified and provided by the contractor.  In the proposal, the availability, maturity, and reliability of the instrumentation packages should be addressed.  (d) Fabrication and Delivery:  The contractor shall fabricate all test articles identified in the test plan.  Test articles shall be built and delivered according to the proposed test schedule.  The contractor shall identify the quantity of components to be furnished by the government (i.e. the directed fuze type (whether live or inert), explosive fill, etc.)  The method of transporting completed test articles and location to which they are to be delivered should be discussed in the proposal.  
(e) Test Support:  The contractor shall support all aspects of testing, both contractor conducted and government conducted.  The contractor generated test plans, as approved by the Government, will become a contractual requirement.  The contractor shall provide test support to include the following:  support test planning meetings; provide test setup advice; oversee/conduct test article build up, checkout, and upload of hardware; provide instrumentation package support; provide information and analyses in the format necessary for the government to obtain the required approval for testing, transportation, and storage; identify risk or potential problems and suggest improvements; record test setup; observe tests; assist as necessary in the collection of all data needed for evaluation of the HSP performance; document test results; perform analysis to quantify the performance of the ordnance package, and compare the quantified test results with the pretest predictions; compare test results to LaBombA prediction for depth of penetration; report on tests.  
(f) Final Report:  The contractor shall present in sufficient detail all work performed on the HSP contract in technical report format.  The Final Technical report shall be releasable to DoD and US DoD contractors only.  Detail is sufficient when the report is a stand-alone document addressing the concept and technology evaluated, and the performance demonstrated.  The final report should include design documentation, any special fabrication instruction, a summary of test events, test predictions, test results, post-test analysis and conclusions.  
(g) Management:  The contractor shall manage cost, staffing, schedule, and security to meet the cost, technical, schedule, and security requirements of this contract.  The contractor shall communicate the technical and programmatic status through scheduled meetings discussed in Paragraph 8. The contractor shall provide technical risk assessment, program schedule and cost of contract.  

(4) Design Requirements:  The design of the HSP case, including material selection, and fuze integration, explosive selection, and integration issues associated with the fuze and explosive into the case, shall be the responsibility of the prime contractor.  In the event the fuze mounting assembly fails, the HSP contractor shall correct the problem.  The contractor must establish an agreement with the fuze contractor (identified in Annex 1) regarding responsibility in the event of a fuze failure.  This agreement should be discussed in the proposal.  

(5) Environmental Protection Requirements:  During the design and test effort, the contractor shall evaluate the potential environmental impact associated with the fabrication and test of the HSP.  Pursuant to federal statutes, the contractor shall minimize the use/selection of hazardous materials and processes utilizing hazardous material to avoid or minimize generation of hazardous wastes as identified in 40 CFR 261. The contractor shall notify AFRL/MNMI if hazardous materials are utilized during the contract or would be required for the technology being developed.  Additionally, the topic shall be discussed at the regular periodic program reviews.  If hazardous materials are used or generated during the program, the contractor shall be responsible for the identification, generation, and submission to the appropriate environmental regulative authority of all technical data and documentation required to obtain approval for the use of hazardous material(s) in fabrication and/or testing of the HSP, generation, or disposal of any associated hazardous wastes. The contractor shall also be aware of, and bring to the immediate attention of the AFRL/MNMI, any aspects of the contractor's HSP development and test effort that might potentially affect or be affected by international treaties related to chemical and/or biological materials (or their surrogates) or weapons, or related test facilities which simulate their production, storage, or test.  

(6) Transformational Management for Accelerated Technology Transition Tasking (TMATT) (formerly, called "Affordability Tasking"):  The contractor shall plan and implement a TMATT program using the Integrated Product and Process Development (IPPD) Process Model to insure that TMATT is a key consideration during requirements definition, preliminary design, detailed design, and development.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Key West Research Center (KWRC) plans to procure a Pixcell II for the existing Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM) System, Pixcell I with Arcturus Engineering Inc., 400 Logue Ave., Mountain View, California 94043. The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 421450 and the business size standard is 100 employees. The NCI  Key West Core Facility acquired the Pixcell I prototype machine manufactured by Arcturus in 1997.  The LCM system has been in continuous use by representatives from the laboratories of most Key West Core Facility principal investigators, as well as other investigators within NCI.   Emphasis today is on translational cancer research which has made it more important that an upgrade be procured.  The minimum specifications of the Pixcell II upgrade are: 1) ability to achieve a much smaller, more specific capture of a desired tissue.  The upgrade will capture individual cells as small as 5 microns in diameter and areas as large as 50 microns.  Currently the facility is limited to 20-30 microns. 2) Provides the "Integrated Visualizer" for enhanced visualization of tissue and is useful when working with stained sections. 3) Upgraded system allows for live video, making image capturing easier. 4) Smaller laser size allows for use of the high specificity caps, new caps provide improved starting material for microarray techniques. and 5) Upgraded Pixcell II can be incorporated with the existing microscope and laser.  Arcturus Engineering is the only known source to the NCI that can provide the aforementioned instrument.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT, (local Washington DC time) on June 14, 2002.  If you have any questions, please submit them in writing to Malinda Holdcraft on electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax, 301-402-4513.

Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  Faxed capability statements will not be accepted.  If submitting capability statements, please provide one original and two copies to Malinda Holdcraft, NIH/NCI/RCB, 6120 Executive Blvd. Suite 6072, Rockville, Maryland 20852-7194.

<DESC>The Air Force is investigating the availability of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) portable lighting systems. The goal of the investigation is to identify several commercial man-portable lighting systems, which may be the most practical for use with and without night vision goggles (NVGs). The results of this market survey will be forwarded to the USAF Air Mobility Battlelab, along with a recommendation for a demonstration of the technology if the research determines that appropriate COTS systems exist. Through this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), the United States Air Force is soliciting product information from all areas of the commercial lighting systems industry to accomplish this goal. The primary selection criteria for all proposals will be the most practical system for use on and around USAF airbases and aircraft. All offerors are strongly encouraged to submit literature on their product that best meets the following specific performance criteria. Specific Performance Criteria: system will be used in various climates and altitudes. It will be transported primarily in USAF aircraft cargo compartments and used with NVGs. Operating temperatures range from minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit thru 120 degrees Fahrenheit. The system must operate in the rated temperature range at high humidity up to 94 percent nominal. It must function at cabin pressures equivalent to altitudes of 25,000 feet. System must also function during and after aircraft rapid decompression and while being subjected to vibration, shock and acceleration as encountered during air, sea, and ground transportation. Primary operating environment will be in open-air and must be able to operate in a sand and dust environment. It must also be able to stand alone/upright and be able to withstand winds up to 30 mph (26 knots). Weight of system (including battery): Threshold: 8 pounds; Objective: 6 pounds or less; must be man-portable. System must utilize infrared or other covert lighting source needed to augment NVG use. System must be capable of illuminating a six-foot tall person at a minimum distance of 100 feet. Beam spread needs to be a minimum of 10 degrees vertical and 30 degrees horizontal. Battery must be rechargeable.  Battery life (continuous operation), before having to recharge: Threshold: 10 hours. A remote control (on/off) capability either manual RF or motion sensor activation is desired. If RF is manual, the controller should be able to operate more than one light source/component. Currently, there is only limited Battlelab funding identified for this program, however, if research indicates that the lighting system technology is available and transferable to the USAF, funding will be sought for prototype demonstration and recommended to Headquarters, Air Mobility Command. Submission Deadline: Product Information may be submitted until 18 June 2002. Refer technical questions and submit product information to: Mr. Mike Geyser, Concurrent Technologies Corporation, 703-491-8234, geyserm@ctc.com 100 CTC drive Johnstown, PA, 15904 703-491-8234 geyserm@ctc.com General BAA Information: this notice itself constitutes the BAA as per FAR 6.102(d) (2). There shall be no formal RFP. The Air Force reserves the right to select for award, any, part of, all, or none of the proposals received. The Air Force may or may not purchase any of the portable lighting systems demonstrated. This BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Air Force to pay any prototype costs related to this announcement. Offerors are advised that only the Air Mobility Command is legally authorized to commit the Government to the obligation of funds.

<DESC>The Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Department of Health and Human Services contemplates awarding a three year cost reimbursement contract on a sole source basis to the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors, Inc (NASADAD).  The statutory authority for this sole source contract is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), per FAR 6-302.1.   It is anticipated that this contract will be awarded without competition since the purpose of this contract is to provide a support mechanism for State and CSAP collaborations to respond to recent legislative changes in SAPT Block Grant requirements. NASADAD is an organization that coordinates and serves as a representative voice for the State Alcohol and Other Drug Directors responsible for the administering the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant, supervising the drug and alcohol programs in the treatment and prevention areas at the State level.  This relationship lends to a natural opportunity for NASADAD to interact with State on a variety of topics.  If responsible sources believe there are extenuating circumstances which would enable them to perform the requirement, they may submit proposals which will be considered by CSAP/SAMHSA.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.   Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  As mentioned previously, NASADAD is an organization that coordinates and serves as a representative voice for the State Alcohol and Other Drug Directors responsible for the administering the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant, supervising the drug and alcohol programs in the treatment and prevention areas at the State level.  NASADAD's knowledge repository of its State members will be critical in furthering discussions that will provide information to CSAP from the State perspective on prevention issues.  Interested parties may submit their proposals to Lynn Tantardini, Contract Specialist.  Responses will be received until July 18, 2002.

<SUBJECT>16--Low Cost Aerial Delivery System (LCADS)
<SOLNBR>DAAD16-02-X-XXX1
<RESPDATE>070802
<ARCHDATE>08072002
<CONTACT>Nina  Shopalovich, 508 233 5293
<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Soldier and Biological Chemical Command (SBCCOM), Natick, MA is conducting a market investigation to identify domestic products, suppliers, manufacturers and technical information to develop a Low Cost Aerial Delivery System (LCADS).  The LCA D system will provide a low cost alternative to compliment the current Container Delivery System (CDS) for fast and efficient airdrop of supply loads during operations that do not allow for recovery of air items, as often is the case with combat re-supply or humanitarian assistance missions.  During Operation Provide Promise in Bosnia, U.S. Forces delivered humanitarian aid using over $31 million of standard airdrop equipment with no equipment recovered.  The LCADS design will greatly reduce airdrop mission  costs.  LCADS will be a one-time use, stand-alone airdrop system consisting of a modular suite of low cost airdrop items, and be comprised of parachutes, containers, platforms, and other air items configured for low-velocity (impact velocity of 28.5 fps),  high-velocity (impact velocity of 90 fps), and free-drop (without the use of a parachute) aerial delivery of loads.  All components must be simple in design, maintenance and operation, and have low production and lifecycle costs.  The emphasis is on use o f readily available, low cost materials and ease of manufacturing in order to minimize production lead times and broaden the industrial base for LCADS items.  Innovative designs, processes, and materials should be considered in the development of LCADS com ponents.  Some examples include, but are not limited to, cross parachutes, stitch-less seaming technology and non-woven fabrics.  Product characteristics should minimize or eliminate rigging time, allow for long shelf life and have low weight and volume. LCADS has both performance and cost requirements.  LCADS performance threshold (T) and objective (O) requirements are: (1) Must meet the rigged load capacity of 500-lbs to 2,200-lbs (T) of current CDS drops or exceed 2,200-lbs (O).  Future requirements wil l be for capacities of up to 10,000-lbs; (2) Must be capable of delivering serviceable loads in 13-knot ground winds (T), 18-knot ground winds (O); (3) Must meet (T) or exceed (O) the load accuracy and survivability of current high-velocity and low-velocit y CDS drops; (4) Must be air-droppable from standard AF cargo aircraft (T) and special operations, NATO and other services aircraft (O); (5) Must be compatible with Army and Air Force ground material handling equipment (MHE); (6) Must be capable of being d eployed at release altitudes between 500-ft AGL (O) to 1,250-ft AGL (T) for low-velocity drops and 15,000-ft MSL (T) to 25,000-ft MSL (O) for hi-velocity drops at airspeeds of 130-150 Knots Indicated Airspeed (KIAS).  LCADS cost threshold (T) and objective  (O) requirements are: (1) LCADS must reduce costs by 55% or more (T) to 80% or more (O) over current Container Delivery System (CDS).  This means that the cost for a high-velocity system must be between $250 and $565 and for a low-velocity system between $730 and $1645.  Cost requirements include both cost of materials and producibility of components.  Materials used to construct components are readily available.  System components should be easy to manufacture.  Production lead times should be minimized.  At this time, SBCCOM is seeking sources, concepts, technical and product information, for a Low Cost Airdrop Capability or any individual components that meet the above requirements.  Also, information is sought for materials and processes that would allo w for ease of manufacturing and minimize production lead times.  All interested firms, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this request for information.  Proprietary information will not be disclosed outside the U S Government.  Interested sou rces shall include information detailed in the CBD Note 25 regarding a firm’s experience, personnel, and facilities.  This market survey is for information purp oses only; this is not a Request for Quotations.  No solicitation document exits.  Responses may be sent via email to nina.shopalovich@natick.army.mil, or by regular mail to U.S. Army SBCCOM, SFAE-CSS-FP-F (ATTN: Nina Shopalovich), Kansas Street, Natick, M A  01760, Telephone (508) 233-5293, Fax  (508) 233-4716.

<SUBJECT>D -- eAuthentication Industry Day
<DESC>The United States General Services Administration (GSA) invites industry, to participate in an eAuthentication Industry Day concerning the Federal Government?s eAuthentication initiative.  As one of the 24- E-Government initiatives, this initiative is key in the government?s program to improve efficiency and effectiveness through the use of improved technology.  The goals of the E-Government initiatives are to eliminate redundant systems and significantly improve the government?s quality of service for citizens and businesses. 

eAuthentication is envisioned as a service that will be provided to and through the FirstGov.gov portal.  It will provide authentication services to the other E-Government initiatives, and eventually across Government lines of business, allowing citizens, government entities, and their employees, businesses, and other institutions to conduct authenticated interactions.  It will also leverage and interoperate with existing credential management infrastructures, including components and services.  

The government is currently engaged in an Authentication Gateway prototype development effort that will focus on demonstrating feasibility, exploring technical agency and application interface issues, identifying various information policy issues, and developing a set of requirements to be used as part of a full and open competitive solicitation, planned for early FY03.

Mark Forman will deliver the opening remarks and the eAuthentication Integrated Project Team will provide information on the initiative to include mission, vision, goals, and objectives.  There will be a detailed discussion of the Authentication Gateway, acquisition strategy, and other important information.  The eAuthentication team is interested in hearing from Industry - this forum will provide that opportunity. 

The eAuthentication Industry Day is on Tuesday, June 18, 2002, from 9:00AM until 12:00 noon at the Department of Commerce Auditorium located at 14th Street NW and Constitution Avenue.  Parking is available at the Reagan Center and the Federal Triangle Metro stop is the most convenient to the Department of Commerce.

Please Register for Industry Day at www.cio.gov/eauthentication.  Seating is limited.  You must be registered to attend this event.  Registration will close on Friday June 14, 2002.  The registration list will be provided to Department of Commerce Security personnel and your name must appear on the list to gain admission. Picture ID is required upon arrival.  Please arrive early.
