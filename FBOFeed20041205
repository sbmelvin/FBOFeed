<DESC>The US Department of Agriculture Risk Management Agency (USDA RMA) intends to procure the services of a contractor to perform a comprehensive evaluation of its Cultivated Clam pilot crop insurance program. RMA policy requires evaluations of its pilot programs, which culminate in a decision by the FCIC Board of Directors to modify, terminate, continue as-is, or convert the program to permanent status.  The US Department of the Interior, through its Franchise Fund activity GovWorks, will manage this procurement action on behalf of the USDA RMA. USDA RMA is interested in any ideas or recommendations that may improve its ability to meet its pilot evaluation objectives through the contracting process. A draft statement of work (SOW) is being released to the public with the intent of soliciting suggestions, comments or recommendations from potential offerors or subject matter experts for the improvement of the statement of work. Contract proposals are not being solicited at this time.  After timely feedback in response to this RFI is obtained and considered, the Government intends to finalize the SOW and issue a request for proposals (RFP). FOR AN ELECTRONIC COPY OF THE COMPLETE DRAFT SOW FOR THIS RFI, PLEASE GO TO http://www.govworks.gov/vendor/csolicit.asp AND LOOK UP THIS RFI NUMBER: 1435-04-05-RI-41191. Please provide comments back to Ron Robinson no later than 12/28/04 at Ronald.robinson2@mms.gov.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

1.  Can you confirm that we can bid for a completely wireless network (except for the computer room where servers will be wired)?

Yes, you may bid for a completely wireless network. The IRR prefers a wireless system but realizes the limitation with potential dead spaces in the building. A combination of wire and wireless networks is also acceptable. The Contractor shall propose the best LAN architecture as part of the solicitation.

2.  In the meeting we were informed that in addition to the 50 laptops stated in the solicitation, the department is expecting a quote for 150 desktops. Is this correct and should we offer that?

The solicitation mentions 50 laptops. After further consideration, the IRR would prefer to include 150 desktop computers with the solicitation. Assume Compaq, or equivalent high-end computers. New desktops are needed because many of the existing computers are out-dated, low quality, and will not be compatible with the network design. In addition, the contractor will provide 5 document scanners and 5 color laser printers. Assume high-end brand equipment for budgeting purposes.

3.  In the meeting there was referenced to three other locations than the main building, while in the solicitation it was stated two locations only other than the  main building. Also, in the meeting it was stated that the distance to these locations is about 3Km while in the solicitation it is stated as 1.3Km. Can you please clarify the correct number of locations and distances involved?

There are two  locations in addition to the main station building requiring connectivity to the LAN. Distribute the 150 desktop network computers in all three locations ( Baghdad Station - Technical Station Building -Shalchiya )

1.      Shalchiya Shops, approximately 5 Km from the main station;. 
2.      Between the main station and Shalchiya Shops is the Technical Station Building, approximately 1.5 Km from the main station

4.  A connection to the Internet is required, which will be delivered via VSAT. Should we then quote only for the cost of the VSAT or the Annual subscription too (which is the more important cost)?
 
	A connection to the internet is not required because the IRR already have built the internet network (VSAT) with a help of another contractor. The download speed is 2,048 kbps and the upload speed is 512 kbps. The Contractor is responsible for upgrading the connection if necessary.

5.  Provide Internet System Specs. With Upload and Download values

 This is a design issue that will be up to the contractor to recommend to the IRR. 

6.  Provide the workstations Specs and the exact quantities?

8.  What is the redundancy level you are looking for?

Assume minimal redundancy for the solicitation.

9.  Do you oblige the wire connection to be hidden into the wall or you accept a cable tray on wall?

Through the hallways, any LAN cables should be inside the ceiling and not outside the walls to the extent possible. Cable trays outside the walls are acceptable for the individual offices. The LAN cabling can also be located in weather-tight conduits on the exterior of the station. The Contractor shall design the best architecture and work with the IRR Computer Department for approval.

10.  How many users will be simultaneously connected to each application?

11.  What type of power connection is needed? 

 The power connection we needed is from the main electric to the UPS and to the servers and the main counsel work stations located in the IRR Computer Department and also assume all the servers are here as well.  

12.  Will they need a recovery solution with each workstation? 

 Yes, we need a recovery solution for the network form the servers to all the workstation.

13.  Conditions in which the systems will be housed, (workstations & servers) and will all equipment have to be physically secured?

	PCO Logistics is required to track equipment, materials and goods coming into Iraq under the Re-building Iraq effort. This tracking and inherent accountability process will assist in assuring that all equipment materials and goods are able to cross the borders and move to final destination with minimal delay and at reduced risk.   However, in order to accomplish this mission, maximum cooperation is necessary.  Prompt notification and compliance with our information requirements will assist in providing advance notice to the point of entry of all inbound shipments.  This process affords coordination in the movement of all convoys which will enable improved monitoring and de-conflicted convoy schedule.  Prompt notification also improves security coordination through the operations center.
To get started follow the following steps:   

Step One: 
Upon contract award the contractor is required to provide the necessary logistical information needed by PCO Logistics. This information can be provided and updated as necessary by going to the PCO website (http://www.rebuilding-iraq.net) and logging in by selecting “Contractor/Vendor Log In” under the Logistic heading.  Initial log in will require the user to request a user name and password. Once the username and password is provided the user can identify and grant access to the other members or subcontractors.    Should there be any problems with this process contact the Logistics Movement Coordination Center (LMCC) Watch Officer directly at the following e-mail address:  pcolmcc@halliburton.com and the necessary assistance will be provided.  If the interim process is still in place the contractor will find four (4) forms listed and available under the logistics heading (Logistics Information Requirements Form, Reconstruction Levy Exemption Form, Cargo Plaques and Logistical Support Request).  Those forms should be individually completed and, with the exception of the cargo plaque, sent electronically to the above mentioned e-mail address for the LMCC.  The first form submitted will be the Logistics Information Requirements Form. The Logistics Information Requirements Form should be completed upon award of contract and updated as necessary.  All updates and changes to this form should be sent to the same e-mail address as the original form.  Additional contact information is available on the website mentioned above. Always reference the contract number.  

Step Two:
CPA 1-47  CUSTOMS LEVY EXEMPTION AND SHIPMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR RECONSTRUCTION PROJECTS UNDER PROJECT AND CONTRACTING OFFICE (PCO) 

Effective 15 April 2004 Tariff Regulations pursuant to CPA Orders #54, as amended by Order #70 (Orders #54 and #70 are posted on the website), require commercial importations into Iraq to pay a 5% levy except for food, books, medicine, medical equipment, clothes and oil.   Additional exemptions include NGO’s, International Organizations, Reconstruction Projects under PCO, and single exempt donations.   Items shipped under this contract are exempt from this “Levy” provided a completed Reconstruction Levy Exemption Form is attached and included with each invoice and packing slip.  
 
The contractor is required to fill out the Reconstruction Levy Exemption Form and attach the duty free form to each shipment of goods under this contract that crosses the border into Iraq in order to qualify for the exemption.  The contractor must submit one copy of the completed duty free form and a copy of the first page of the primary contract, for customs verification, to the contracting officer and the PCO Logistics Office at pcocustoms@halliburton.com) 72 hours prior to the planned arrival date at the Iraq point of entry.


Step Three:
The items being acquired are for Iraqi Reconstruction and as per the “Packing and Marking Instructions” of this contract, and shall be Packaged and Marked accordingly.  Additionally, a Cargo Plaque is available from the website at http://www.rebuilding-iraq.net under the logistics tab located at the top of the page.  There is a memorandum posted that explains how to complete the plaques.  There are three plaques, one is for shipments arriving into Baghdad International Airport, one is for shipments arriving into the Port of Umm Qasr, and the third one is for all other shipments.  The use of these plaques will ensure they are properly identified as PCO shipments and will reduce risk of loss or pilferage.  Each shipment must have a cargo plaque affixed to all sides of each container, pallet, or package.
 
Step Four:
If this contract has the shipment bound for a PCO warehouse location and will require PCO Logistics to assist in the shipment from the point of entry into Iraq or material handling equipment support at the warehouse, a Logistical Support Request (LSR) must be completed and submitted 48 hours prior to expected movement of the shipment or its arrival at the point of entry.  The LSR can be found at the above mentioned web site under the logistics tab.

It is the contractor’s responsibility to provide all the requested information mentioned above as well as using the identified cargo plaques in sufficient time to allow for required delivery.  Failure to comply with these instructions may result in a delay of the goods and materials being shipped from arriving at their final destination. Delays resulting from failure to follow the above steps may be assigned as the contractor’s responsibility.
