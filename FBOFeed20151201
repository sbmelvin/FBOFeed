By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</span></p>

<p>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Room 1E144, Bethesda, MD 20892, UNITED STATES</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description:</span></strong></p>
<p>National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Clinical Genetics Branch (CGB), plans to procure on a sole source basis the services for telomere length Assay testing from the Repeat Diagnostics, Suite 309-267 West Esplanade, North Vancouver, BC V7M 1A5 CANADA.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1) and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System code is 621511 and the business size standard is $32.5M.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The period of performance will be twelve (12) months from date of award.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) is a research program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), one of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Division is the world's most comprehensive cancer epidemiology research group. Its renowned epidemiologists, geneticists, and biostatisticians conduct population and multidisciplinary research to discover the genetic and environmental determinants of cancer and new approaches to cancer prevention. The Division's research impacts public health policy in the United States and around the world.</p>
<p>The Clinical Genetics Branch (CGB), DCEG, NCI, NIH is engaged in an ongoing clinical genetics study that shows, that among patients who received hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for severe aplastic anemia (SAA), longer donor telomere length was associated with a higher overall survival probability. Because of the clinical importance and the translational potential of such finding in refining donor selection, the CGB designed several studies to validate its previous work. <br /><br />This procurement is part of this effort in which the CGB will use the CLIA-certified flow FISH assay to precisely quantify donor telomere length and correlate their measurement with patient HSCT outcomes in a subset of 220 donors with available blood samples from the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) repository.<br /><br />This particular study is part of a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, intramural research program within the DCEG's Human Genetics Program which is focused upon elucidation of the entire spectrum of scientific and clinical issues related to familial and hereditary forms of cancer. This is an ongoing study, and this submission is a continuation of that work and not new work.</p>
<p>Contractor shall perform the following tasks:<br />&bull; Measure telomere length in provided samples using flow FISH 6-panel assay<br />&bull; Provide the NCI Technical Point of Contact with a data file containing:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; o Sample ID, age of recipient and age of donor<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; o Telomere length absolute measurement for all cell types<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; o Telomere length percentile in relation to donor age-matched controls<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; o Telomere length percentile in relation to recipient age-matched controls <br /><br />Reporting and/or Deliverables:<br />All telomere length measurements are expected to be completed within eleven (11) months of the Period of Performance. The NCI Technical Point of Contact will coordinate / communicate the format required for the data file referenced in Section C, with/to the Contractor. The data file is to be sent by email to the NCI Technical Point of Contact.</p>
<p>Government Responsibilities:<br />&bull; The NCI Technical Point of Contact will follow-up with the Contractor to ensure the completeness and accuracy of collected data and tumor tissue samples. <br />&bull; The NCI Technical Point of Contact will notify the Contractor prior to shipment of specimens so that the recipient will be available to receive the shipment. <br /><br />Inspection and Acceptance: <br />&bull; The reports defined above will be scrutinized and subsequently accepted within 30 days of receipt.</p>
<p>This laboratory testing service is provided by Repeat Diagnostics. Repeat Diagnostics is the only known laboratory that can perform the studies required in the SOW. The proposed Vendor has US CLIA-certification, and the required telomere length assay by flow-FISH. They are uniquely qualified in the development and implementation of this assay, which is both sensitive and specific to this requirement. This study uses cryo-preserved samples. The proposed Vendor is the only known laboratory that can use the available sample source to provide telomere length measurements using the required assay. The CGB's study is ongoing, and the performance characteristics and quality of the needed services are required for maintaining the integrity of on-going studies. A change would be disruptive to the ability to analyze their cumulative results. This study is an integral part of an on-going NCI protocol.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party, especially small businesses, believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. Responses must be received in the contracting office by 10:30AM EST, on Dec. 11, 2015. All responses and questions must be in writing and faxed (240) 276-5401 or emailed to Catherine Muir, Contracting Officer via electronic mail at muirca@mail.nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, Contractors must be registered and have valid, current Entity Record, including current Representations and Certifications, in the System for Award Management (SAM) through SAM.gov.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK</strong></span></p>
<p>PROJECT TITLE: Access to Wiley's Online Resources</p>
<p>I. Statement of Work</p>
<p>A. Background Information</p>
<p>John Wiley &amp; Sons provides access to online resources for NIH staff and HHS agency staff served by the NIH Library (DLS), including over 1500 journals in a wide range of scientific, technical and medical subjects; the Cochrane Library; Current Protocols; and select online reference works. Links from PubMed, Web of Science&reg;, and the NIH Library website allow NIH staff to connect directly to the articles on the Wiley website following a search of the various sites. Wiley online resources allow DLS to provide enhanced and timely access to information NIH staff need to perform their work whether they are intramural researchers or extramural program administrators. Feedback from NIH and HHS researchers, clinicians and administrators indicates that the easy accessibility of needed information made possible by providing electronic access to Wiley resources has increased their productive work time, because of the time saved identifying and retrieving relevant articles.</p>
<p>B. Objectives</p>
<p>The specific objective of this requirement requires the contractor to provide the NIH and the HHS agency staff served by the NIH Library (DLS) access to the electronic version of all Wiley journals, the Cochrane Library, Current Protocols, and select online reference works through its web interface. Access will be cumulative for articles published in the journals since 1997 or the first year a journal was offered on the Wiley platform. The contractor is also required to provide access to other databases and journals as outlined under the "specific requirements" section of this SOW.</p>
<p><br />II. Services to be performed</p>
<p>A. General Requirements</p>

<p>2. All work under this contract shall be monitored by the Project Officer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>B. Specific Requirements</p>
<p>Specifically, the contractor shall:</p>
<p>1. Provide the NIH and the HHS agency staff served by the NIH Library (DLS) access to the electronic version of all Wiley journals, the Cochrane Library, Current Protocols, and select online reference works through its web interface. Access will be cumulative for articles published in the journals since 1997 or the first year a journal was offered on the Wiley platform, based upon previous investments.</p>
<p>2. The contractor also shall provide options for acquiring eBooks, online reference works, and backfiles of selected journals. Options should factor in all previous investments in print and digital subscriptions, as well as previous archive backfile purchases.</p>
<p>3. The contractor may also provide options to include all Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) agencies with access to the same resources as identified in this contract.</p>
<p>4. In the event of a major natural disaster (local, regional, national, or international), then in addition to the other rights granted under this Agreement, Wiley will allow DLS to provide access to the Licensed Electronic Products for a maximum of 180 days upon approval which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed after which time an extension may be granted to any otherwise unaffiliated health professional, ("Emergency Workers") and ("Displaced Users") from other institutions that are not included as one of DLS' Institutions but which have been affected by such a disaster ("Emergency Institutions") so long as the DLS has established temporary affiliation with such an Emergency Institution in order to meet the demands of the population affected by the disaster and any healthcare needs resulting from the disaster. For purposes of this Agreement, such Displaced Users, Emergency Institutions and Emergency Workers will be considered Authorized Users of the respective Institution that requests Wiley to provide the access to the Licensed Electronic Products under this clause. Under this clause, Wiley will allow previously unidentified IP addresses that are provided by DLS access to the Licensed Electronic Products.</p>
<p>5. DLS may fulfill interlibrary loan requests in accord with Section 108 of the United States Copyright Law (17 USC Sec. 108, "Limitations on exclusive rights: Reproduction by libraries and archives") and clause 3 of the Guidelines for the Proviso of Subsection 108(g)(2) prepared by the National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works.</p>
<p>6. DLS shall retain perpetual access to all subscribed years of resources.</p>
<p><br />C. Government Responsibilities</p>
<p>1. The Government will be responsible for providing an interface via web links for the NIH community to access the Wiley website.<br />2. NIH will be responsible for creating a system to validate security for entrance into the website.<br />3. Upon signature by the Government, the contractor license agreement will be incorporated into the contract.</p>
<p>D. Reporting Requirements and Deliverables</p>
<p>1. The contractor shall regularly provide the Project Officer with monthly usage statistics for individual journal titles as well as aggregated use data for journals and databases, complying with industry standards such as COUNTER and SUSHI.</p>
<p>2. Monthly usage data shall be broken out separately for NIH and for the individual HHS agencies served by the NIH Library/DLS. Each report should include title, ISSN, eISSN, monthly usage, and YTD usage.</p>
<p>3. Use by selected NIH institutes may also be required when that use is identifiable, e.g. from IP range or log in.</p>
<p>4. A quarterly report detailing all titles being provided through this contract shall be provided. This report should include the title, ISSN, eISSN, publishing status, journal title URL, and any status-related comments.</p>

All responsible sources believing they can provide the required supplies/services may submit a written capabilities statement or proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  Written responses shall clearly show their ability to perform the work without compromising the quality, accuracy, reliability, and delivery of the requirements.

2)	Automatic buret rinsing and automated sample disposal to waste. 
3)	Titrator buret, 10 ml volume, capable of providing 10,000 step resolution.
4)	Titrator buret, 5mL volume, capable of providing 10,000 step resolution.
5)	Spare 5 mL buret unit for method development or matrix modification dosing
6)	System should provide for rapid change over from one buret/analysis system to the other. 
7)	PC controller station with Win7 Professional operating system, printer and monitor.
8)	Operating titration software with dynamic equivalence endpoint detection and automated pH electrode calibration capability, real-time and archivable display of titration curve details, and export of titration data and determine equivalence point(s) in user-definable Excel, CSV and space/tab delimited text files.
9)	Must be capable of measuring pH, mV, temperature and Ion Selective Electrodes (ISE).
10)	Software with programmability to automatically add matrix-adjusting chemicals from supplemental buret units.
11)	System shall be capable of direct, electronic, sample mass upload from analytical balance.
12)	Interface for Sartorius BP221S analytical balance.
13)	pH electrode for Alkalinity determinations.
14)	Combination Ag metallic or AgCl electrode for Chloride determinations.
15)	All electronic cables and liquid tubing shall be included.
16)	3 year warranty on all components.
17)	Delivery thirty (30) days after award.


This procurement will be accomplished using FAR Part 12 and 13 Procedures.  The government anticipates awarding a single fixed price purchase order.   The EPA anticipates award will be made by December 29, 2015.  The request for quotation is anticipated for release on or about December 8, 2015, and will be made available through FedConnect at www.fedconnect.net.  Submit your questions concerning this synopsis via FedConnect at www.fedconnect.net.  Telephone requests will not be honored.   One or more of the items under this acquisition are subject to Free Trade Agreements.

The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information.</p>
<p>INFORMATION REQUESTED:</p>
<p>(a) Background: The Government is conducting market research to identify possible sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to competently and competitively print the HC-130J and MC-130J Flight Manual; to include complete flight manual sets, supplements, revisions and 6 month updates. There are approximately 34 Flight Manuals (17 HC -130J and 17 MC-130J). The size of flight manuals can range from 45 to 1800 pages. Page count for the quarterly change cycles will vary based on the number of Publication Change Requests (PCRs) processed each cycle and the number of pages impacted by the changes. All TOs are currently provided as both Indexed-Portable Document Files (iPDF) and PDF print formats only. All change/revision print packages are to be completed and ready for shipment to Government locations within 30 days or less from date of print request. Emergency or Urgent Action situations supplements must be printed and shipped within 7 days from date of print request. All flight manual data shall remain in the same style/format of current HC/MC-130J TOs.</p>

Interested parties should respond to this RFI with capability statements which include/address the following information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Describe your past experience (no more than five examples) to include:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Respondents to this RFI should assume Government will be able to provide a complete set of Flight Manuals (via DVD) to offeror if a contract is awarded. Respondents should fully explain their plan to print and distribute in the time frame required. This includes using either KNA or REVLAR 4.7mil thick, synthetic paper for all checklists and Dura-document for all other manuals. Respondents will be responsible for obtaining the afore mentioned synthetic paper while still meeting the ready for shipment timeline stated in paragraph (a) (Background) above. Respondents should define how HC/MC-130J Flight Manuals will be stored and safeguarded to prevent unauthorized access and/or disclosure.</p>

<DESC><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">This is not a solicitation but rather a Request for Information (RFI) to determine potential sources for information and planning purposes only.</span>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">This request does not constitute a Request for Quotation (RFQ), Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does this issuance restrict the Government's acquisition approach. There is no solicitation available at this time. Contractor proposals will receive no response. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this synopsis nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. The Air Force has not yet determined the acquisition strategy for this requirement, including determining if a set-aside strategy is appropriate. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The purpose of this RFI is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist and to assist the United States Air Force (USAF) in determining if a future contract effort can be competitively awarded and/or awarded on a total or partial Small Business Set-Aside basis. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">The applicable </span>North American Industrial Classification System (<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">NAICS) code assigned to this effort is 334511 (Search, detection, navigation, guidance, aeronautical, and nautical system and instrument manufacturing) with the Small Business Size Standard in Number of Employees of 750</span>. If the Government decides to award a contract for this or a related effort, a solicitation will be published and posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website. The Government will use this information solely to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy for this procurement. The Government is interested in all small business concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Exelis is currently the prime contractor for the production of the PLM-4 Radar Signal Simulator (RSS) Accessory Kit Items (5963-01-508-8776EW Electronic Module, Standardized; 6130-01-509-0564EW Charger, Battery; 5995-01-514-5456EW Cable Assembly, Radio Frequency (RF); 6130-01-514-5455EW Adapter, Power Supply). Exelis owns the technical data required to remanufacture and produce spares. Parties expressing interest in this requirement must have the capability to access pertinent technical data needed for repairs, technical support, and contract program management. Interested parties must also be able to provide repair and parts service for the designated AN/AAR-44 circuit cards and return them to the Government (or designated inventory) in serviceable condition that meets or exceeds the manufacturer specification. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Note: This request for information is for the purpose of obtaining information relative to an upcoming manufacturing effort in the EW Supply Chain Management Squadron (408 SCMS/GULA) at Robins AFB,GA. The Contracting Office within the Air Force Sustainment Center will serve as the procuring organization. Companies are encouraged to provide responses to this questionnaire but are advised that their participation is voluntary and no reimbursement of any kind will be provided. Interested sources must have performed manufacturing services of the PLM-4 Radar Signal Simulator system in the past</span></p>

<p>Sources Sought</p>
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.</p>
<p>The 22d Contracting Squadron (22 CONS) of the 22d Air Refueling Wing is conducting market research to determine the availability, interest and capability of potential small business sources qualified and able to perform laundry and dry cleaning service requirements at McConnell AFB, Kansas. The information in this notice is based on the best and most current information available to date. This information is subject to change and is not binding to the Government. Updated information will be provided in future announcements and posted electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) homepage at www.fbo.gov. The Government shall not reimburse the costs of preparing responses to this request for information / sources sought notice.</p>
<p>The estimated contract period including all options is 1 October 2015 through 30 September 2020. The successful contractor shall provide laundry and dry cleaning services for the locations designated in the contract in compliance with all local, state, and Federal laws. The Performance Work Statement requires that the contractor provide all personnel, equipment, materials, supervision and other items and services necessary to perform laundry and dry cleaning services for linens, rags, uniforms and other miscellaneous items, to include delivery and pickup services. Attached you will find the Estimated Annual Workload, which provides a list of all known items associated with the requirement at this time. These services are funded by both non-appropriated and appropriated funds. The NAICS code for this requirement is 812320, Drycleaning and Laundry Services (except coin-operated). The Small Business Size Standard is $5,500,000.</p>
<p>The Government requests interested parties submit a brief statement of current capability to perform these services and a letter of interest. Interested and qualified sources should provide the following information: (1) company name, point of contact, e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers, type of business and size [i.e.; Small, SBA Section 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZone), Women Owned, and/or Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SDVO)]; (2) a list of your most recent and relevant DoD and/or commercial contracts (not to exceed ten) to include a brief description, names, POCs, phone numbers, value &amp; type of contract, and period of performance; and (3) information about your company and why you think you can perform this service.

In order to be considered in this market survey, please reply by close of business, 4:00 pm CST, 13 February 2015.</p>
<p>22 CONS is interested in quantifying and pre-qualifying the likelihood of setting aside competition for laundry and dry cleaning services for McConnell AFB to a small business. Depending upon the response to this notice and other market research, 22 CONS may limit the competition to a specific category of small business at the exclusion of all other potential business concerns. This announcement serves as a first step for 22 CONS to determine the viability of setting aside the procurement for laundry and dry cleaning services for competition solely within or among certain small businesses in selected categories. Please note that the Small Business Administration (SBA) currently has this requirement under the 8(a) Program in accordance with 13 CFR 124. This is a Sources Sought announcement only; no solicitation exists or is available at this time. Requests for a solicitation shall not receive a response.</p>
<p>This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. In the event a solicitation is developed, it will be assigned a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) number and the announcement will be published on the FedBizOpps website at www.fbo.gov. Potential interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation package as well as downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments, if any.</p>
<p>AFFARS 5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (APR 2014)<br />(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the interested party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, the interested party may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsman, Mr. Gregory Oneal, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, email: gregory.oneal@us.af.mil.

This is a Sources Sought Synopsis announcement, a market survey for information to be used for preliminary planning purposes.  The information received will be used within the Navy to facilitate the decision making process and will not be disclosed outside of the agency.  The intent of this Sources Sought Synopsis is to identify potential qualified Small Businesses, U.S.
 Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) Businesses, SBA certified HUBZone Small Businesses, Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Businesses, and/or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses.  

This Sources Sought Synopsis is one facet in the Governments overall market research in regards to whether the proposed solicitation will be issued as a competitive set-aside or as full and open (unrestricted).  No procurement strategy will be determined based solely on the information received in response to this Sources Sought Synopsis.

No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.
 This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose other than market research.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of this market research.

Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Southwest is seeking Small Business, SBA certified 8(a) Business, SBA certified HUBZone Small Business, Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Business, and/or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business sources with current and relevant experience, personnel, and capability to self-perform a multiple award construction contract for new construction, repair, and renovation of various heavy horizontal construction projects.

The term self-perform refers to performing relevant major trade work in-house without subcontractors.
  This does not include administrative or management functions.  Relevant major trade work is that which is the same or similar to the work that may be ordered under the proposed contract.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237990 (Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction) with a Small Business Size Standard of $36.5 million.  Task orders issued under the proposed multiple award contract(s) will be performed at various federal sites within the area of responsibility (AOR) of Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest including, but not limited to, California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico.  However, it is anticipated that most projects will be performed in the state of California.
  The proposed contract(s) will be for one base year with 4 one-year options, resulting in the contract performance period maximum of 5 years.  The estimated total contract price for the base year and all option years combined is $200,000,000.  Task order range is estimated between $300,000 and $25,000,000.  

Projects will be primarily design-build or secondarily design-bid-build for new construction, repair, and/or renovation of heavy horizontal and civil engineering construction projects.  Projects may include, but are not limited to: Outdoor Shooting  and  Combat Training Ranges  and  Terrains, Canals  and  Channels, Dams  and  Embankments, Bridges, Erosion Control and Stormwater Management, Landfills, Ammunition/Weapons Magazines, Irrigation  and  Landscaping, Recreational Fields  and  Parks, and Tunneling  and  Horizontal Directional Drilling.

Interested sources are invited to respond to this sources sought announcement by using the forms provided under separate file titled Sources Sought Information Form.
  The following information shall be provided: 

1)  Contractor Information: Provide your firms contact information, including DUNS number and CAGE Code. 
2)  Type of Business: Identify whether your firm is a Small Business, SBA certified 8(a), SBA certified HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, and/or Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Business concern.  For more information on the definitions or requirements for these small business programs, refer to http://www.sba.gov/. 
3)  Bonding Capacity: Provide your suretys name, your maximum bonding capacity per project, and your aggregate maximum bonding capacity. 
4)  Locations: Identify the locations in which you are willing and capable to work.
 
5)  Experience:  Submit a minimum of three (3) and maximum of five (5) recent specific government or commercial contracts/projects your firm has self-performed to demonstrate your experience in heavy horizontal and civil engineering construction as indicated in this announcement.  A specific project is a single project or a single task order under an indefinite quantity contract or on-call type contract.  Recent is defined as having been 100% completed within the five years prior to the Sources Sought Synopsis issuance date.  All projects shall have a minimum construction cost of $300,000.  Projects which do not meet these requirements may not be considered relevant.  Additional submission requirements:
---Submit at least one self-performed relevant project with a construction cost of $3,000,000 or above.
---Submit at least one relevant project demonstrating self-performed construction experience with outdoor shooting  and  combat training ranges and terrains.
---Submit at least one relevant project demonstrating self-performed construction experience with canals, channels, dams, or embankments.
---At least one of the relevant self-performed projects shall demonstrate experience with new construction.
---At least one of the relevant self-performed projects shall demonstrate experience with design-build.
 

For each of the projects submitted for experience evaluation, provide the following:
---title and location
---award and completion dates
---contract or subcontract value
---type of work for overall project and type of work your firm self-performed
---current customer information including point of contact, phone number, and email address
---whether the work was performed as a prime or subcontractor
---type of contract (Design-Build or Design-Bid-Build  see Sources Sought Information Form)
---narrative project description
---description of the work that was self-performed by your firm, including the percentage of contract value your firm self-performed

For design-build projects, identify the name and address of the A-E firm used to provide design or specify if design was performed in-house.
 Identify your working relationship with the design firm (i.e., number of years working together).

In sections where recent experience is requested, all experience will be evaluated for market research purposes only.  Firms are advised that while experience older than five years or not yet 100% complete may demonstrate capability to perform the scope of work, it may not indicate that the firm could be competitive during a future solicitation where only the most recent five years of experience will be accepted.  NAVFAC may make an acquisition strategy determination based on the likelihood that a sufficient pool of qualified contractors will be competitive on a future solicitation.

Responses to this Sources Sought announcement are due no later than 2:00 p.m.
 (local time) on December 15, 2015.  Please address your response to NAVFAC Southwest, CI Contracts Core, Attn: Michelle Sanders, Code RAQ20.MS, 1220 Pacific Highway, San Diego, CA 92132-5190.

The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future requirements.&nbsp; The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period&rsquo;.&nbsp; Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the &ldquo;Register to Offer Space&rdquo; link and follow the instructions to register.&nbsp; Instructional guides are offered in the &ldquo;HELP&rdquo; tab on the AAAP website.

<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br />The Sacramento District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has an upcoming acquisition to establish a contract to mitigate a landslide located on the downstream right abutment of Pine Flat Dam, Piedra, California. <br />The Pine Flat Project is located approximately 30 miles east of Fresno, California and is operated and maintained by the Corps of Engineers, Sacramento District. The Pine Flat Dam and Lake, and supplemental channel improvement work, were authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1944. The dam was completed by the Corps of Engineers in 1954, and the channel improvements were completed in 1976. The Pine Flat Power Plant Project was authorized by the Federal Energy Regulation Commission license (issued in 1979), and construction was completed by the Kings River Conservation District in 1984. <br />This is a landslide located near the northerly abutment of Pine Flat Dam that requires mitigation. The landslide covers an area approximately 200 to 220 feet wide by 380 feet long (downslope) and is located on the south slope of Hughes Mountain. The limits of the landslide are shown on Figure 1. The depth of the landslide has been interpreted to be up to 80 feet below the ground surface. The direction of previous movements of the main body of the landslide is to the southeast, towards the dam. Records indicate the presence of relic instability at the location of the existing landslide prior to construction of the dam and that materials at the toe of the landslide mass were removed during excavations for the dam foundation. The landslide has been reactivated in the past after high rainfalls and construction to stabilize the landslide.</p>
<p>Landslide mitigation will include; <br />&bull; Earthwork for the installation of tieback whalers, retaining wall backfill, surface drainage ditches and access roads.<br />&bull; Installation of tie-back anchors with surface whalers. (See Figure 2) <br />&bull; Construction of cast-in-place concrete and gabion-type retaining walls.<br />&bull; Instrumentation installation to evaluate the performance of the landslide and mitigation. The instrumentation will include load cells, survey monuments, inclinometers, and piezometers <br />&bull; Erosion Control installation including temporary and permanent gravel all-weather access roads, hydro-seeding, and rip rap dissipaters.</p>

<DESC>PURPOSE:
The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. Offers are not being solicited at this time. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information. 

SUMMARY:
VA's National Acquisition Center (NAC) is issuing this Notice to locate potential sources to serve as a unit-of-use re-packager/distributor of generic pharmaceuticals needed by the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) healthcare facilities, to satisfy VA inpatient and outpatient needs.  The NAC will purchase the products and arrange for delivery of such products to the contractor for repackaging.  Potential re-packagers would need to be able to provide receipt, warehousing, inventory management, repackaging and labeling, packaging, online ordering capability, and distribution of pharmaceutical products.   


PROGRAM OVERVIEW:
The NAC will purchase the products separately from this service, and arrange for delivery of such products to the re-packager for repackaging. The re-packager shall have the capability to provide repackaging of product in pharmacy grade, round, High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE), white plastic containers that include a child resistant convertible cap and tamper evident seal. These caps shall contain VA specific logos, to be identified by VA. All plastic must be identified with a number 1, 2, or 3 designations for recycling. The contractor is responsible for supplying, printing, and applying labels to the repackaged unit of use product following all regulatory requirements. Bar codes must be clear and defined with no break in the bar code graphics. All products shall be stored in a warehouse capable of maintaining drugs at USP controlled temperature, and segregated from contractor's other products. Contractor will receive orders from the facilities electronically, through the contractor's web-based interface and provide a fax line for manual orders, and ship FOB destination to approximately 160 hospitals located in every state, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and Guam, and to 7 Consolidated Mail Outpatient facilities. Shipping costs will be a component of the contractor's repackaging fee. The re-packager must apply an adhesive label to each case used to ship full case quantities that accurately identify the contents of the case. All pallets shall be wrapped using black shrink wrap to encapsulate the pallet and containers. VA estimates that approximately 6.7 million bottles of various sizes ranging from 120cc - 950cc will be repackaged each year for a specific number (currently 8, but this number may increase or decrease) of drugs. The re-packager shall have enough warehousing capability to maintain an approximately 550,000 (this number may increase) bottle inventory [cased] at all times. The re-packager shall possess a Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) certification for Class III (narcotic and non-narcotic), Class IV, and Class V controlled substances. The re-packager's control, accounting, and repackaging procedures shall conform to applicable FDA laws, regulations and requirements including those governing Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) that prevent misbranding or adulteration of government owned products, as well as meet DSCSA requirements. The re-packager must have two years proven past experience as a re-packager in performing the breadth and depth of the repackaging services stated herein. 

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this industry is 493110, and the corresponding small business size standard is $27.5M. This is determined by taking the annual average gross revenue of the business concern for the last three fiscal years. 

If your firm meets the FDA and DEA requirements stated above and can provide the above repackaging services stated, please respond to this notice. When responding please include your company size, DUNS number, NAICS codes, and any applicable GSA Schedules you are contracted under. No other information is necessary as these responses are for planning purposes only. Interested sources may respond to this notice via email to Brandon.Maness@va.gov, on or before 8 December 2015. 

This Sources Sought does not obligate VA to the release of a solicitation.

<DESC>Synopsis: NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. <p> THE TECHNOLOGY: Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a method of using a coherent laser to process polyimide films impregnated with a soluble solution of palladium metal in a novel way to produce controlled metal layers in-situ. The laser allows patterning in the x and y dimensions and can accurately embed metal layers at different depths in the polymer films by controlling the intensity of the laser radiation. The metallic interlayers and patterns are produced in the polymer by a combination of ultraviolet (UV) laser processing and thermal curing. These films exhibit photoactive properties that can be tailored for optical devices, such as reflectors and mirrors, by controlling the intensity of a coherent laser to embed metal layers at different depths in the polymer films. These novel photo-assisted self-assembled nanoparticle films exhibit significant absorption in the optical and near infrared regions and change dimensions on exposure to radiation. They display mechanical properties similar to bi-metallic strips. These films have potential applications in electronics and optics, such as MEMS switches and opto-mechanical isolator switches. NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially. <p> To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to <a href="mailto:LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov">LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov </a> with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information.  Please also provide the nature of your interest in the technology along with a brief background of your company. For more information about licensing other NASA-developed technologies, please visit the NASA Technology Transfer Portal at <A HREF="http://technology.nasa.gov/">http://technology.nasa.gov/ </A>  . <p> These responses are provided to members of NASA Langleys Office of Strategic Analysis and Business Development OSACB for the purpose of promoting public awareness of NASA-developed technology products, and conducting preliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for future licensing opportunities. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, OSACB will follow the required formal licensing process of posting in the Federal Register.  No follow-on procurement is expected to result from responses to this Notice.

License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. <p> THE TECHNOLOGY: Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a method for exfoliating commercially available hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) into nanosheets a few atomic layers thick. Currently hBN has limited use because it is insoluble with limited dispersibility, despite hBN having excellent thermal conductivity and electrical insulation. Langleys novel method provides for exfoliated hBN nanosheets that are soluble or suspendable in a variety of solvents, allowing for their bulk preparation and incorporation into composites, coatings, and films. This simple, cost efficient, and scalable method can produce solution-processible exfoliated hBN nanostructures in bulk quantities. Thermally conductive and electrically insulating exfoliated hBN and has potential applications in microelectronics, advanced composites, and the biomedical field.  NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially. <p> To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to <a href="mailto:LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov">LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov </a> with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information.

NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. <p> THE TECHNOLOGY: Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed innovative self-healing resin that automatically reacts to mechanical stimuli. Current structural materials are not self-healing, making it necessary to depend on complicated and potentially destructive repair methods and long down times. Unlike other proposed self-healing materials that use microencapsulated healing agents, this technology utilizes viscoelastic properties from inherent structure properties. The resulting technology is a self-healing material with rapid rates of healing and a wide range of use temperatures. The method chemically introduces mechanically sensitive chemical groups into the structure of a resin. By introducing mechanoresponsive functional groups to a polymer, it is possible to induce self-healing through the transformation of such chemical groups to where mechanical properties of a structure are almost completely restored. The forces imparted by a damage event can therefore be used to enable healing or repair of the structure. NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially. <p> To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to <a href="mailto:LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov">LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov </a> with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information.  Please also provide the nature of your interest in the technology along with a brief background of your company. For more information about licensing other NASA-developed technologies, please visit the NASA Technology Transfer Portal at <A HREF="http://technology.nasa.gov/">http://technology.nasa.gov/ </A>  . <p> These responses are provided to members of NASA Langleys Office of Strategic Analysis and Business Development OSACB for the purpose of promoting public awareness of NASA-developed technology products, and conducting preliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for future licensing opportunities. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, OSACB will follow the required formal licensing process of posting in the Federal Register.  No follow-on procurement is expected to result from responses to this Notice. <p>

<DESC><p>The U. S. Army,&nbsp;Corps of Engineers, Los Angeles District, is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Los Angeles District, anticipates a future procurement to perform Design Build Services for Combined Test Force (CTF) Compound, Edwards Air Force Base, Kern County, Ca<br /><br />The cost of construction for this project is estimated to be greater than $70,000,000.00. <br /><br />The proposed project duration - project must be completed by summer 2019.</p>
<p>1. Replies to this notice are being sought from firms with a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code of 237990&nbsp; The location of this work is at Edwards Air Force Base, Kern County, California.</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S. C. 158(f).</p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurements. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large scale construction projects. (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) Advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 "Notice of Requirement for Project labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 "Project Labor Agreement."</p>
<p>The construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>(1) Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts in Kern County, CA?<br />(2) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor?<br />(3) Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<br />(4) What type of project should not be considered for PLA clauses?<br />(5) What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA?<br />(6) What is the cost impact to the bid/proposal due to a PLA?<br />(7) What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include a PLA provision in a Los Angeles District contract?</p>

<CONTACT>Rudolph J. Spencer, Phone 3016192789, Email rudolph.j.spencer.civ@mail.mil
<DESC><br />THIS IS A NOTICE TO AWARD A SOLE-SOURCE CONTRACT AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.
<p>The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, IAW FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), with Fisher Scientific Company LLC, a part of Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., 4500 Turnberry Drive, Hanover Park, IL, 60133-5491, as the only responsible source that can provide the required serum. This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) intends to award a firm-fixed priced commercial contract for Gibco Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) 10437-028. 10437-028 is currently being used in (GLP) regulated studies for Ebola Virus and Hantavirus. All of USAMRIID's cell culture research evolves into late stage drug development studies and the same reagents must be used throughout the regulated studies. As such, It is not possible to deviate from the use of Gibco FBS 10437-028 because assay methods have been validated with this particular reagent. Ongoing and planned FDA regulated studies, for these viruses at USAMRIID, specify the use of Gibco FBS 10437-028. The original batch of GIBCO FBS 10437-028 was procured under contract # W81XWH-15-P-0481 from Life Technologies, who has since been brought by Thermo Fisher Scientific, who is now the sole supplier of GIBCO FBS 10437-028. <br />Specifically, the required Gibco FBS 10437-028 must meet the following specifications:</p>
<p>Endotoxin level: &le; 50 EU/ml (levels routinely &le; 10 EU/ml)<br />Sera for cell culture with robust cell line<br />Hemoglobin level: &le; 25 mg/dl<br />Origin: Countries meeting USDA importation requirements<br />ISO 13485 certified, processed in FDA registered facilities<br />Labeled for in-vitro diagnostics (compliant with highest level of USP sterility testing)<br />Triple filtered at 0.1 &micro;m<br />Peel-off sticker on label<br />Packaged in 500 ml, sterile, plastic bottles<br />Expiration dates must be no less than 3 years from time of shipment with the longest expiration date possible preferred.</p>
<p><br />There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 325413 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This announcement constitutes the only notice by the government; a written solicitation will not be issued. All sources that believe they are eligible to provide these items must respond in writing. Responses must be supported with clear and convincing evidence to clearly articulate the ability to provide the items outlined above. A request for documentation will not be considered an affirmative response. This Special Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotes. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement is in the best interest of the Government. If no written responses are received by the date listed below, which reflects 5 days after the publication of this notice, the purchase will be awarded without further remark. All questions and responses concerning this notice shall be emailed to Mr. Rudolph Spencer at rudolph.j.spencer.civ@mail.mil.</p>
<p>Interested concerns must identify their capability in writing to the above e-mail address or by mail to the address listed below no later than 11:00 am EST, Monday, 7 December 2015.&nbsp; No phone calls accepted.</p>

<p>52.212-2 Evaluation -- Commercial Items (OCT 2014)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Initially, proposals shall be ranked in order of price from lowest to highest. Then, the lowest priced proposal shall be evaluated, including any option prices. Each offeror's price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness. Unrealistically low proposed costs/prices may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that either the offeror does not understand the requirement or the offeror has made an unrealistic proposal.</p>
<p>Technical Evaluation<br />Offers shall be evaluated independently of the cost/price proposal evaluation to determine the offerors compliance with the technical requirements of this solicitation. The government may make a final determination as to the rating of an offer based on the proposal as submitted without requesting any further information. Offerors proposals will be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Subfactor 1: Must have experience as a musician as either a musician, pianist, or organist. <br />Subfactor 2: Must demonstrate proficient musical skills through an audition prior to the awarding of the contract. If a contractor is out of state auditions can be held via Skype or other web base options.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of Provision)</p>

The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line-Item Structure (SEP 2011)</p>
<p>(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal <br />Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to <br />ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.<br /><br />(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71. A sample solicitation line-item structure and a corresponding offer of a proposed alternative line-item structure follow.<br />Solicitation:</p>

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <BR> <BR>(4) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ? 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ? 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <BR> <BR>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ? 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <BR> <BR>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). (The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <BR> <BR>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (FEB 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)).

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product<br />Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:<br /><br /><br /><br />(2) Certification.

Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]<br />(1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)<br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).<br />(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p><br />SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS<br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>
<p>Due to enhanced security measures, ship and base access is required for pre-award ship visits (e.g. ship-check) and for contract performance. Specifically the following permissions are required:</p>
<p>1. El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) personnel screening requirement<br />2. Base/Repair Facility Access Request<br />3. Vehicle Access Request<br />4. Ship Access List (vendor-provided)</p>
<p>All forms are available for download on the MSC contracts webpage at http://www.msc.navy.mil. Click on "Contracts" in the upper right corner. "EPIC template" is under "Reference" subheading. Click on "Online Library of Common Documents" for all other forms.</p>

Complete EPIC form strictly adhering to format requirements and forward to (CONUS East Coast repairs) msc.norfolk.epic@navy.mil and (CONUS West Coast and HI repairs) MSC.SSUSD.EPIC@NAVY.MIL. EPIC personnel screening requests are desired seven calendar days prior to performance start date. Requests will be managed as expeditiously as circumstances permit. Vendor will be notified by MSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>
<p>Vehicle Access: Required for vehicle access to Navy facilities. Follow supplemental instructions on Base Access forms or base-specific vehicle access forms.</p>
<p>Ship Access List* (Vendor-Provided): On company letterhead attachment via email, the vendor is required to provide the ship master (courtesy copy the Port Engineer) with an accurate, current list of performing personnel prior to being admitted aboard the vessel. Under no circumstances will a hand-delivered list be accepted.</p>

The purchase order will match the quote; the invoice must match the purchase order and any agreed upon modifications. Any quotes that exclude a cost until after award, such as shipping or tax, are nonresponsive, and will not be considered.

ALTERNATIVE SUGGESTIONS FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS: Vendors may submit multiple quotes with alternative product suggestions, as long as each alternative fits the required specifications, and meets or beats the suggested brand name in functionality, features, and warranty. We will evaluate each quote separately, even if from the same company. 

TECHNICAL ACCEPTABILITY: Representatives from Glen Canyon National Recreation Area will evaluate all proposals for technical acceptability, and the Contracting Officer will award the purchase order to the company that provides the lowest price technically acceptable.

Each bidder's SAM (www.SAM.gov) record must indicate that the business is small under the applicable NAICS code(s).  If you need help determining if the SBA considers your business small, check your SAM record by entering the DUNS number or name in the search box, or email KimberleyRobinson@nps.gov with your DUNS number.  Please keep in mind that your company must, as some point, have been registered to do business with the federal government through the Central Contractor Registration (www.CCR.gov), or the System for Award Management (SAM) in order for us to ascertain your business size at the time your company was registered.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation No. DTRT5716Q80013 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation is being conducted in accordance with the policies and procedures prescribed in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-83-3, effective November 1, 2015. The NAICS Code is 562910 and the Small Business size standard is 500 Employees.
<p>The U.S. Department of Transportation, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) in Cambridge, MA intends to solicit, negotiate, and award a purchase order to AECOM USA, Inc., Wakefield, MA, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." The Government intends to procure, through a firm fixed-price purchase order, Remediation services for additional soil and groundwater sampling that will be conducted at the ZJX ARTCC facility in Jacksonville, Florida in the FAA Eastern Service Area (ESA). After the sampling is complete, a remedial action (RA) will be conducted to remove identified contamination, in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW) below.</p>
<p>Statement of Work (SOW) - Begin<br /><br />1 INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Under an Interagency Agreement, the John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) is providing support to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Facilities Environmental Cleanup Program. As part of this effort, additional soil and groundwater sampling will be conducted at the ZJX ARTCC facility in Jacksonville, Florida in the FAA Eastern Service Area (ESA). After the sampling is complete, a remedial action (RA) will be conducted to remove identified contamination. <br /><br />2 SITE ACTIVITIES<br /><br />2.1 Background</p>
<p>The site is located in Hilliard, Florida approximately 20 miles northwest of the Jacksonville International Airport. The site occupies approximately 29-acres of land and includes an office building, area control facility, generator building, waste water treatment plant, garage, guard house, several satellite systems and antennas, asphalt and concrete areas, grass areas, and a retention pond. There are three 15,000-gallon capacity aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) that supply diesel fuel to the emergency electrical generators. The ASTs are located along the southeast side of the FAA complex. The area of investigation is immediately adjacent to the east side of the generator building between the former location of the surge AST and the current ASTs.</p>
<p>On November 3, 2014, Florida Utility and Power dropped service to the ZXJ ARTCC. The facility's emergency electrical generators activated automatically and began running. Two hours later, a leak from the overflow pipe of the 2,000-gallon capacity emergency generator surge AST (T4) was discovered. Fuel dispensing system sensors indicated approximately 50 gallons of diesel fuel was released from the overflow pipe onto the asphalt and concrete surfaces adjacent to the surge AST. The release was reportedly cleaned up using spill kits and there were no visual impacts to grassy areas or waterways.</p>
<p>The FDEP was notified of the spill the same day it occurred. On November 4, 2014, the FDEP stated that soil sampling would be required due to the poor condition of the asphalt in the vicinity of the surge AST. On December 3, 2014, Volpe Center conducted a limited site investigation (SI) to evaluate the potential for subsurface soil contamination resulting from the release. Twelve soil samples were collected from ten sample locations and analyzed for total recoverable petroleum hydrocarbons (TRPH). Soil analytical results indicated four samples collected from three boring locations contained TRPH concentrations exceeding the soil cleanup target level (SCTL) listed in Chapter 62-777, Florida Administrative Code (FAC). SCTL exceedances were detected in Volpe Center SI samples S101, S102, S201, and S301. TRPH concentrations detected in these samples ranged from 1,700 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) to 16,000 mg/kg. Soil samples with the highest TRPH concentrations (S201 and S301) were analyzed for Volatile Petroleum Hydrocarbons (VPH) and Extractable Petroleum Hydrocarbons (EPH) using the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MADEP) method to fractionate the TRPH results. Fractionated TRPH results still exceeded SCTLs at these locations. TRPH concentrations detected in all other Volpe Center SI soil sample locations were below applicable SCTLs.</p>
<p>A FDEP discharge reporting form (DRF) was filed on December 10, 2014. During March 2015, Volpe Center on behalf of FAA contracted with AECOM to complete a more detailed investigation of the diesel fuel release to comply with requirements listed in Chapter 62-780, FAC. On March 27, 2015, AECOM conducted a project kick-off meeting on-site with Mr. Evan Starr, (Volpe Center) to meet local FAA personnel, inspect the area of investigation, and provide oversight during a private utility location. A remedial investigation work Plan (RIWP) was submitted to Volpe on April 10, 2015. Volpe approved the RIWP on April 22, 2015. Site assessment activities described below were completed during May 2015.</p>
<p>Soil analytical results indicate concentrations of multiple COCs detected in borings SB-5, SB-6, and SB-13 exceed direct exposure and/or leachability SCTLs listed in Chapter 62-777, FAC.</p>
<p>Groundwater analytical results from the May 28, 2015 groundwater sampling event indicate the benzene concentration (3.1 micrograms per liter [&mu;g/L]) detected in monitor well MW-3A and the naphthalene concentration (18 &mu;g/L) detected in monitor well MW-6A both exceed applicable GCTLs listed in Chapter 62-777, FAC. All other COCs detected were equal to or below applicable GCTLs.<br /><br />2.2 Tasks to be performed</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform the tasks detailed below.</p>
<p>Task 1 - Create a Work Plan</p>
<p>A work plan shall be created for the soil and groundwater sampling and analysis and Remedial Action (RA) to be completed as detailed below in the following sections:</p>
<p>Soil and Groundwater Sampling and Analysis:</p>
<p>The work plan shall include the sampling methods for up to 6 additional soil samples and two additional groundwater monitoring well samples using the same analytical parameters that were sampled in the initial sampling effort. If any additional sampling parameters are recommended, the contractor shall discuss these with the Volpe representative prior to proceeding with the work.</p>
<p>Remedial Action:</p>
<p>In addition, at this time there is an estimated maximum of 60 CY of soil to be removed from the site. The methods for removing this soil, completing clearance samples and restoring the site shall be detailed in this work plan. If the soil sample results show additional areas that require remediation, the work plan can be amended upon receipt of the new results.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall submit a draft Remedial Action Work Plan (Work Plan) within 5 business days that addresses the project requirements below.</p>
<p>This task involves the preparation and submission of a draft and final Work Plan. The Work Plan shall detail the technical approach and schedule for conducting all soil remediation activities described below. To assist with preparation of the Work Plan, the contractor shall thoroughly review the Government-furnished Reports (provided under separate cover) for pertinent information.</p>
<p>The work plan shall identify the required permits needed to perform the work and the Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining those permits, if required. In addition, the Work Plan shall describe methods for performing soil remediation at the site. The Work Plan shall summarize the number, depth, and type of confirmation samples to be collected upon the completion of the soil remediation work and shall summarize the restoration plans and methods for the site. <br /><br />An additional component of the Work Plan is the Site Safety and Health Plan (SSHP), which shall include personnel health and safety precautions to be followed.</p>
<p>An outline summarizing the required content of the work plan is shown below:<br /><br />1.) Technical Approach<br />a. Methods procedures for soil remediation and restoration<br />b. Identify required additional material sampling (including clearance samples of contaminated soil areas, where required) <br />c. Identification of required work permits<br /><br />2.) Site Safety Health Plan (SSHP)<br />The contractor should expect a 5 business day Volpe Center review period between submission of the Draft Work Plan and receipt of Volpe Center comments. The Volpe Center and the Contractor shall meet to discuss any comments and changes, if necessary. <br /><br />The contractor shall make the changes and submit a Final Work Plan within 5 business days of the receipt of comments.</p>
<p>Task 2 - Perform Soil Sampling and Analysis</p>
<p>The contractor shall take up to 6 additional soil samples to delineate the extent of the contamination and define the remedial action area. These samples shall be analyzed using the same analytical methods as the initial soil sampling effort. If any additional sampling parameters are recommended, the contractor shall discuss these with the Volpe representative prior to proceeding with the work.</p>
<p>Task 3 - Perform Groundwater Monitoring Well Sampling and Analysis</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform groundwater monitoring well sampling at wells MW-3A and MW-6A and analyze them using the same analytical methods as used with the initial groundwater sampling effort. If any additional sampling parameters are recommended, the contractor shall discuss these with the Volpe representative prior to proceeding with the work.</p>
<p>Task 4 - Soil Remediation and Related Activities</p>
<p>There is an estimated maximum of 60 CY of soil to be removed from the site. Due to the presence of nearby fuel pipelines and tanks, the FAA has requested the use of vacuum extraction for the soils on this site. The soil shall be remediated according to the above mentioned work plan.</p>
<p>Task 4a - Confirmatory Sampling</p>
<p>Confirmatory samples shall be taken from the remediation area in the sidewalls and the bottom of the excavations to confirm that all petroleum contaminated soils have been removed. The sidewall samples shall be taken mid-height and the bottom samples taken in the approximate center of the removal unless otherwise instructed by the Government on-site representative. One confirmation sample shall be taken for every 5 ft. length from each sidewall and one from the bottom for every 5 ft. length (plus necessary QA/QC samples) unless otherwise approved by the Government representative. For example if the remediation area is 5 ft. wide by 10 ft. long there will be one sample taken from each of the 5 ft. sidewalls for a total of 2 samples, two samples taken from each of the 10 ft. sidewalls for a total of 4 samples, and two samples taken from the bottom for a grand total of 8 samples plus necessary QA/QC samples. If the remediation lengths or width are 5 ft. or less, one confirmation sample shall be taken from each side and one from the bottom for a total of 5 samples. Toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) samples shall also be taken for disposal purposes. As stated in Section 2.2.1, all samples must be analyzed in accordance with required FL DEP analytical methods.</p>
<p>Task 4b - Restoration of Disturbed Areas</p>
<p>After the completion of all remediation and removal activities, the contractor shall restore the site. The contractor shall fill or otherwise level low areas and compact and re-grade the site to its approximate original grade. The contractor shall supply clean, uncontaminated fill. The contractor shall compact any filled areas to 95% compaction to eliminate any settling. If a concrete pad or asphalt was removed to conduct the soil removal activities, they shall be replaced in kind.</p>
<p>Task 5 - Complete all Florida State Reporting Requirements (including RA report)</p>
<p>This site is in the Florida Department of Environmental Protection's (FLDEP) Fuel Storage Tank program. As part of this program, certain reporting and notifications are required. The contractor shall complete all FLDEP required notifications and reports in order to achieve a no further action letter from the FLDEP. In addition, an RA report is required for FAA internal site closure.<br /><br />The contractor shall provide an RA closeout report, detailing the work completed at the site. The contractor shall provide to-scale drawings of the remediation/removal areas that include the locations of clearance samples and site photographs taken before/during/after remedial activities.

If the Joint Venture's legal name is not registered in SAM by the time of proposal submission, the offeror will not be considered for award. In addition, the joint venture's legal name shall be clearly printed in Block 17a of the SF1449 when submitting the proposal package. (FAR 52.219-14)<br />The proposal must clearly state who the prime contractor will be for the joint venture. In addition, a copy of the executed joint venture agreement shall be on file with the contracting office prior to award. If the joint venture is submitted under the 8A Small Business Program, it shall be subject to approval by the U.S. Small Business Administration prior to award in accordance with 13 CFR 124.513.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FACTORS FOR AWARD<br />Basis of Award<br />This acquisition will utilize Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures in accordance with FAR 15.1012. Accordingly, award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of the proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost/price factors. No tradeoffs are permitted. Additionally, proposals will be evaluated for acceptability but not ranked using the non-cost/price factors.</p>
<p>To be considered technically acceptable, no evaluation factor in the quote may be determined to be unacceptable. The failure of a proposal to meet all of the requirements under any factor will result in a technically unacceptable rating and preclude award.</p>
<p>The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government's interest. The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award on initial proposal submission. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal shall contain the offeror's most favorable terms from a technical and price standpoint.</p>
<p>Any costs incurred by offerors in preparing or submitting offers are the offerors' sole responsibility; the United States will not reimburse any offeror for any proposal preparation costs.</p>
<p>Proposals shall be valid for a minimum of 90 calendar days after submission or will be deemed technically unacceptable.</p>
<p><br />Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Evaluation Process<br />The technical factors will be evaluated on an "Acceptable" or "Unacceptable" basis. The "Acceptable" and "Unacceptable" criteria will define a standard of comparison for the solicitation requirements. Proposals shall completely and adequately address non cost/price factor(s) to demonstrate that the Offeror can successfully perform the solicitation technical requirements to be considered as "Acceptable" and therefore technically acceptable.</p>
<p>The Government will first evaluate price proposals in order to identify the lowest-priced proposal. Only the lowest priced proposal (NOTE: LPTA evaluation of lowest price will not include Transition (Management Effort) costs or start-up tools and equipment [Mechanical or Janitorial] costs) will be evaluated for technical acceptability. If found to be technically acceptable; then that proposal price will be evaluated for accuracy, completeness, and balance. The remaining technical proposals, if any, shall not be evaluated as to technical acceptability unless the lowest price offeror is found to be technically unacceptable. If the lowest priced proposal is found to be technically unacceptable, then the second lowest priced proposal (and so on) will be evaluated for technical acceptability.</p>
<p>Owing to the volume of responses anticipated and the desire on the part of the Government for an equitable and accurate assessment of each proposal, offerors shall submit proposals conforming to the structure described in the section identified as Specific Instructions for Price Proposal. Proposals which do not conform to all requirements described in this section shall be rejected without further evaluation.</p>
<p>The Government intends to select ONE contractor for award of this effort.</p>
<p>Award may be made without negotiation or discussion. Therefore, offerors are requested to initially submit proposals to the Government on the most favorable terms from a technical and price standpoint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Factors<br />For the purpose of award, the government shall evaluate offers based on the non-cost/price technical evaluation factors described below:</p>
<p>Factor 1- O&amp;M Minimum Performance Standards (Attachment)<br />To be considered technically acceptable, the Offeror has met the minimum performance standards as required and identified on the attached Minimum Performance Standards.</p>
<p>The Minimum Performance Standards evaluation factor is separate and distinct from Past Performance (Factor 3). The Minimum Performance Standards evaluation factor seeks to determine whether the contractor has adequate experience to successfully perform the requirements of the statement of work rather than evaluating the quality of performance on previous contracts, which is captured in the past performance evaluation factor.<br /><br />If the contractor marks 'Yes' but does not provide the supporting information as requested, the quote will be considered technically unacceptable. If the references provided cannot be reached or information cannot be validated, the Minimum Performance Standard factor will be considered technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>The contractor will be technically unacceptable if they cannot meet the minimum standards; the offer is considered technically unacceptable and will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>O&amp;M Minimum Performance Standards Acceptability Criteria<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable The Offeror meets the O&amp;M Minimum Performance Standards which indicate that the Offeror has the capability to successfully perform this requirement.<br />Unacceptable The Offeror does not meet the O&amp;M Minimum Performance Standards which does not provide the Government with any degree of comfort that the Offeror has the capability to successfully perform this requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Factor 2 Janitorial Cleaning Program</p>
<p>To be considered technically acceptable, the offeror must provide a Janitorial Cleaning Program that meets all the requirements stated above.</p>
<p>If the offeror fails to meet all the requirements (methods, frequencies and equipment utilized) outlined in the Janitorial Cleaning Program evaluation criteria, the offer is considered technically unacceptable and will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>Janitorial Cleaning Program Acceptability Criteria<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable The Offeror meets all requirements of the Janitorial Cleaning Program which indicates that the Offeror has the capability to successfully perform this requirement.<br />Unacceptable The Offeror does not meet all requirements of the Janitorial Cleaning Program which does not provide the Government with any degree of comfort that the Offeror has the capability to successfully perform this requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Past Performance<br />To be considered technically acceptable, the offeror shall provide a minimum of three (3) past performance contracts that meet all the requirements of stated above and shall have a minimum of satisfactory performance on survey results and/or any other contracts documented in the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS).</p>
<p>If the offeror fails to meet all the requirements outlined in the Past Performance evaluation criteria, the offer is considered technically unacceptable and will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>Past Performance Acceptability Criteria<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable The Offeror meets all past performance requirements which indicate that the Offeror has the capability to successfully perform this requirement.<br />Unacceptable The Offeror does not meet the past performance requirements which does not provide the Government with any degree of comfort that the Offeror has the capability to successfully perform this requirement.</p>

<DESC><p align="left"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The United States District Courtroom on the third floor of Grant US Courthouse was constructed in 1933 with walnut veneer paneling on all four walls, with solid wood trim and doors and cast bronze ornamentation.&nbsp; The existing finish on the wall panels is in fair condition, but has UV damage is some locations. The window wells were recently restored. A site visit to review existing conditions is recommended.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;The subcontractor for the window wells restoration was retained on that contract to make recommendations for restoration of the veneer panels, solid trim and doors.&nbsp; The consultant subsequently installed a mock-up using their recommended application of a high-solids nitrocellulose lacquer-based system, which was approved by the Courts. Region 5 GSA Facilities then determined that the installed application is too hazardous in terms of flammability, VOC's and carcinogens, and that we could not proceed using that application.</p>
<p align="left"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scope of Work</span></p>
<p>2.1 Contractor to provide recommended wood finish restoration product applications for review and approval by Region 5 GSA Facilities and GSA Historic preservation covering pros and cons of the following characteristics:</p>
<p>a. Ability to maintain the appearance of the original finish (color, clarity, sheen etc.)</p>
<p>b. Level of preservation of the existing historic finish - indicate what prep of existing finish is required - cleaning, full stripping, etc.</p>
<p>c. Hazard (VOC's, carcinogens, fumes, etc.). For applications using hazardous materials, provide a method of managing the hazard. GSA Facilities has a preference for zero-VOC, non-flammable materials but may consider other applications if the aesthetic appearance, durability, ease of maintenance or refinishing/repair is considered more desirable by the consultant preparing the recommendations, and we present an acceptable method of managing the associated risks.</p>
<p>d. Consultant's level of preference for the refinishing/repair application based on performance characteristics.</p>
<p>e. Future maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>f. Durability - how many years of serviceable life are expected, how many years until maintenance may be required.</p>
<p>2.2 Prepare an on- site mock-up of a maximum of four approved applications, for review/ approval by GSA and the Courts.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Award will be based on the contractor technical ability&nbsp;and then price.&nbsp; Technical ability will be determined by reviewing contractors Attachment D, Competency of Bidder Forms &amp; Instructions (To be&nbsp;be submitted with the offer and bid), bid proposal and price. <br /><br /><br />Project Manager is Byron Durham <a style="WHITE-SPACE: normal; WORD-SPACING: 0px; TEXT-TRANSFORM: none; COLOR: #1155cc; FONT: 12.8px arial, sans-serif; WIDOWS: 1; LETTER-SPACING: normal; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; TEXT-INDENT: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px" href="tel:%28312%29886-1951" target="_blank">(312)886-1951</a>&nbsp; <a style="WHITE-SPACE: normal; WORD-SPACING: 0px; TEXT-TRANSFORM: none; COLOR: #1155cc; FONT: 12.8px arial, sans-serif; WIDOWS: 1; LETTER-SPACING: normal; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; TEXT-INDENT: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px" href="mailto:byron.durham@gsa.gov" target="_blank">byron.durham@gsa.gov</a>&nbsp;<br /><br />If you plan on visiting the site please make an appointment with&nbsp;<span style="WHITE-SPACE: normal; WORD-SPACING: 0px; TEXT-TRANSFORM: none; FLOAT: none; COLOR: #222222; FONT: 12.8px arial, sans-serif; WIDOWS: 1; DISPLAY: inline !important; LETTER-SPACING: normal; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; TEXT-INDENT: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px">&nbsp;<strong>Jim Morrison </strong></span><span style="WHITE-SPACE: normal; WORD-SPACING: 0px; TEXT-TRANSFORM: none; COLOR: #333333; FONT: 13px Arial, sans-serif; WIDOWS: 1; LETTER-SPACING: normal; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #f4f7fb; TEXT-INDENT: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px"><a style="COLOR: #1155cc" href="tel:%28574%29%20236-8276" target="_blank">(574) 236-8276</a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><a style="COLOR: #1155cc" href="mailto:james.morrison@gsa.gov" target="_blank">james.morrison@gsa.gov</a></span></strong></p>

<DESC>SUBMISSION OF QUOTES:

<p>The Government is using FAR Subparts 12 and 13 and will award a firm-fixed-priced contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible contractor whose quote conforms to the solicitation.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates award of a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Lowest Price (Cost) Technically Acceptable contractor, i.e. to the contractor with the lowest evaluated realistic price of quotes meeting the acceptability standards for non-cost factors.

Award will be made with appropriate consideration given to the three evaluation factors: Factor 1-Technical, Factor 2 - Past Performance, and Factor 3-Cost/Price.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate quotes and make award without questions to contractors. Therefore, the initial quote should contain the contractor's best terms from a Technical and Cost standpoint. Unclear quotes may not result in questions for clarifications. Offers with an omission or unclear quote may be judged to mean the contractor does not fully understand the requirements or understand what it takes to meet the requirements, regardless of the proposed cost/price and will be rated unacceptable. In that case, the contractor may be found unacceptable, and ineligible for award. The Government reserves the right to ask questions of contractors if the Contracting Officer determines them to be necessary.</p>
<p>Offerors must be registered on the System for Award Management (SAM) to be eligible for award. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. In order to be eligible for award, a contractor must be determined to be responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104.</p>

The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity.

Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:
      (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and

The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.

<DESC><strong>Additional information 12/1/15<br /><br />Question 1. Should all interior doors have a fire rating? What hour should they be if so? I know the existing doors in cafe are fire rated but didn't notice any fire rating tags on dorm doors. Typically doors leading from stairwells are fire rated. I'm guessing we should provide fire glass for the new panel view windows and side lites?<br />Answer:&nbsp;All the doors must be fire rated. 90 minutes is the fire rating on the existing doors. NFPA Code number 101&nbsp;states that all view panes must be fire rated.<br /><br />Question 2: Are there masonary lintels present in existing rough openings of masonary wall locations?<br />Answer: Masonary will have to visually be inspected for lintels during repair.<br /><br />Question 3: What panic bars must be installed in the cafe? In the male dorm the door is all glass how much should the frame be at the bottom?<br />Answer: NFPA code Number&nbsp;101&nbsp;states that the panic bars in the cafe must be equipped with the vertical rods to automaticcally release.<br />The vestibule frame in the male dorms must be 12" on the bottom.<br /></strong>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

It also appears on some of the non-damaged walls that the finish had greatly dulled and lost it's luster.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be very helpful to know the full extent of the area that needs refinished.</span></blockquote>
<br /><em>Correct, all wood paneling and doors in the room will be restored - in a future contract. This procurement is for product recommendations and mock-ups only. A site visit would be very helpful in understanding the condition of the existing finishes and we encourage bidders to arrange one with the property manager, Jim Morrison.</em>

<br /><em>Courtroom is currently in use. Work on mock-ups is to be coordinated with the Courts' schedule for use of the Courtroom - work may be allowed during working hours if fumes are not a problem. <br /></em>

I'm wondering about ventilation? Do any of the windows open to allow for natural ventilation of dust/ odors, fumes? I assume the restoration fumes can't go through the courthouse hvac system and flow into the other rooms.</span></blockquote>
<br /><em>Courtroom windows are not operable. For the mock-ups we don't plan on any special ventilation. For the Courtroom restoration, we are requiring a negative air enclosure and exhausted ventilation to the exterior.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;

<DESC>This contract action is being conducted pursuant to the procedures at FAR Subpart 16.505 under the auspices of Training Systems Contract III (TSC III) LOT I, a Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) Multiple Award Contract (MAC). Therefore, pursuant to FAR Subpart 5.202(a)(6) and 16.505(a)(1), this contract action is exempt from synopsizing requirements. However, to increase transparency of NAWCTSD requirements and increase opportunities for subcontracting, notice of this opportunity is being provided. Only TSC III LOT I Prime Contractors (contractors previously awarded a contract within this vehicle) are considered an interested party in this contract action. All inquiries regarding participation as a subcontractor should be submitted to a Prime Contractor for consideration using the point of contact list provided.
 Any documents available for this contract action not otherwise attached hereto, including but not limited to Solicitations, Statements of Work (SOW), and Specifications will be made available only to qualifying Prime Contractors. 

The Marine Common Aircrew Trainer (MCAT) updated draft solicitation Attachment 12 will be made available to all TSC III LOT I contract holders. Currently, Attachment 12 is a combination of the questions and answers asked before the draft solicitation was made available and those asked after the draft solicitation was posted.  Since the draft solicitation has been posted, only the post draft solicitation questions and answers have been updated as the questions asked before the draft were posted with the draft solicitation itself.
  When the final Request for Proposal (RFP) is posted in January both sets of Questions and Answers will be separate attachments to the RFP.  
It is anticipated by the Government that the final RFP will be issued in January of 2016.  Therefore, the solicitation number will be updated to N61340-16-R-0006 at that time.  However, to remain consistent, RFP N61340-16-R-0006 will still be found in Federal Business Opportunities by referencing RFP N61339-15-R-0003.
Please contact Lynn Carlson if you have any questions pertaining to this posting or solicitation.

<DESC><p>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to enter into a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00024-16-G-4302 for multiple orders from various government agencies to provide shipbuilder coded unique parts and specialized material (s) delineated in the Computer Aided Three-dimensional Interactive Application (CATIA) database and not otherwise available through regular purchasing channels or the Navy Supply System in time to meet mission requirements, for USS SEAWOLF (SSN21) and USS VIRGINIA (SSN774) Class Submarines.</p>
<p>NAVSEA intends to place BOA N00024-16-G-4302 with Electric Boat Corporation, A General Dynamics company (GDEB), located at 75 Eastern Point Road, Groton, CT 06340-4989, and to issue orders from 01 October 2016 through 30 September 2021.</p>
<p>Procurements under this BOA will be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority in 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.

These procurements are unique and must integrate precisely with the existing equipment in terms of form, fit, function, and compatibility.</p>
<p>Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact GDEB directly. Offerors interested in obtaining information about this announcement should submit requests in writing to Danielle C. Tyler, Contracting Officer (NAVSEA 02433), by either U.S. mail or e-mail to Danielle.tyler1@navy.mil.</p>

<DESC><p>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to enter into a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00024-16-G-4303 for multiple orders from various government agencies to provide shipbuilder coded unique parts and specialized material (s) delineated in the Computer Aided Three-dimensional Interactive Application (CATIA) database and not otherwise available through regular purchasing channels or the Navy Supply System in time to meet mission requirements, for USS SEAWOLF (SSN21) and USS VIRGINIA (SSN774) Class Submarines.</p>
<p>NAVSEA intends to place BOA N00024-16-G-4303 with Huntington Ingalls Incorporated-Newport News Shipbuilding (HII-NNS), located at 4101 Washington Avenue, Newport News, VA 23607-2770, and to issue orders from 01 October 2016 through 30 September 2021.</p>
<p>Procurements under this BOA will be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority in 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.

These procurements are unique and must integrate precisely with the existing equipment in terms of form, fit, function, and compatibility.</p>

<CONTACT>Mishelle Miller, Email mishelle.miller@dodiis.mil - Christopher Du Jardin, Email Christopher.DuJardin@dodiis.mil
<DESC>The purposes of this amendment to the Pre-Solicitation Notice are to:<br />1. Delete this sentence from the Statement of Work: "The Offeror shall provide their CAGE code identifying that the Prime Offeror has a TOP SECRET facility clearance and ability to store classified materials at the SECRET level."Thus, there is no requirement that the prime be able to store classified materials.<br />2. Extend the deadline. The previous deadline was 03 December 10:00 a.m. EST. The new deadline is 04 December 1:00 p.m. EST.<br />3. Change the NAICS which was 541511 to now be 541519 Other Computer Services.<br />4. Provide the questions and answers received.
<p>Q1. I saw in the solicitation that there is a "Set Aside Total Small Business". Does this mean that the prime company that responds to this RFI must be a small business? If so, can the small business prime have large company subs on it? <br />A1. The Virginia Contracting Activity is seeking to identify qualified sources. The responder to the Pre-Solicitation Notice need not be a small business. For subcontracting, please read FAR 52.219-14 -- Limitations on Subcontracting.</p>
<p>Q2. Can a prime company that responds be a large business? I'm trying to understand what the "Set Aside Means".<br />A2. The Virginia Contracting Activity is seeking to identify qualified sources. The responder to the Pre-Solicitation Notice need not be a small business. Please read FAR 52.219-14 -- Limitations on Subcontracting.</p>
<p>Q3. We are filling out the matrix for the RFI in the subject and had a question about field 11, Small Business Participation. What are some example values that you would expect to see in this field? <br />A3. EXAMPLE ONLY<br />1. Contract /Title, Project Name (Contract Number XXXX)<br />DOMEX Systems support, XXXXX-XX-X-XXXX<br />2. Performed By: your company name<br />3. Major Subcontractor(s): n/a, or subcontractor name<br />4. Agency/Company: Government Agency that awarded the contract<br />5. CO: Contracting Officer's name and contact information for the agency awarding the contract<br />6. COTR: Contracting Officer's Technical Representative's name and contact information for the agency awarding the contract<br />7. Other Technical POC: Anyone else from the Agency/Company awarding the contract, along with their contact information, who can provide information<br />8. Period of Performance: The start month and year, followed by the end month and year<br />9. Contract Type and Total Value: E.g., Firm fixed price, Time and Materials, Labor Hour<br />The total amount in dollars you anticipate to earn.<br />10. Product/Service Provided: What did you do? <br />11. Small Business Participation: If a small business awarded the contract in #1, how much did you participate in the work? 100% or another percentage?<br />12. Awards, Recognition, and Certifications Received: What compliments, if any, did the Agency give to your company?<br />13. Relevancy of Experience: How close was the contract in #1 to this SOW?</p>
<p>Q4. Are you looking to know if the contract was for only small businesses?<br />A4. No.</p>
<p>A5. Can you confirm the above subject opportunity will be a Small Business Set Aside?<br />Q5. The Virginia Contracting Activity is seeking to identify qualified sources. This is not a Request for Proposals. The Government will not predict. <br />Q6. Will the opportunity be only 3 FTEs (PM, Senior SW Engineer and Jr SW Engineer) or are those the labor categories but the number of FTEs must be determined by the offeror?<br />A6. This is a draft Statement of Work. A potential offeror is to submit a capability statement.</p>
<p>Q7. "All personnel performing services must have a Top Secret/SCI clearance and the company must have a Top Secret facility clearance and safeguarding classified materials at the Secret level." Does the PRIME need to have safeguarding associated with their cage or can a sub, supporting the PRIME have safeguarding? Meaning, if the prime doesn't have safeguarding capabilities but our sub-contractor does, would this meet the requirement?<br />A7. The requirement for safeguarding has been removed.</p>
<p>Q8. While we operate independently, we are no longer technically a small business. Any chance the set-aside status will change or that it was a mistake?<br />A8. The Virginia Contracting Activity is seeking to identify qualified sources. This is not a Request for Proposals. The Government will not predict.</p>
<p>Q9. Does that mean you are accepting responses from all size businesses and will determine contract type at a later date?<br />A9. The Virginia Contracting Activity is seeking to identify qualified sources. This is not a Request for Proposals.</p>
<p>Q10.Is this intended to be a Total Small Business Set Aside or if larger companies (i.e. with revenue greater than $27.5M) would be considered for participation in the final RFP?<br />A10. The Virginia Contracting Activity is seeking to identify qualified sources. This is not a Request for Proposals. The Government will not predict.</p>

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

1.  Contracting Activity:	 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
     	 			 Office of Acquisition Operations
       	 			 Technology Acquisition Center
            			 23 Christopher Way
           			 Eatontown, NJ 07724

2.  Description of Action:  The proposed action is for a sole source firm-fixed-price contract with Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc. (Esri) located at 380 New York Street, Redlands, CA 92373.  

3.  Description of Supplies or Services:  VA, Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Office of the Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Policy and Services (10P) requires a Geospatial Information System (GIS) Healthcare Enterprise Service and Support (GHESS) Enterprise License Agreement (ELA) that will provide various Esri ArcGIS software, cloud services, data, and support services in order to support the goal of creating a GIS shared services platform across multiple disparate offices of 10P.  The offices of 10P include Policy and Planning, Informatics and Analytics, Public Health, Office of Health Information, Patient Care Services, Research and Development, Intergovernmental Affairs, and Ethics.  This will enable multiple offices that are responsible for planning healthcare initiatives, as well as policy makers, access to a uniform platform that is non-variable by providing a consistent infrastructure for geo-spatial data development, analysis, cartographic products and access to web services.  This enables VA to focus policies and planning to increase access for Veterans, especially those geographically dispersed from VA medical centers and clinics.  Esri has the only Geospatial Information System software that has the enterprise capabilities needed to support this level of activity and to allow those with the expertise to participate in this type of analysis.  With the GHESS ELA, VA will have an unlimited user license to deploy and share software and cloud services.  Software and cloud services include the ArcGIS software suite of products such as ArcGIS Desktop, ArcGIS Server, Portal for ArcGIS, ArcGIS Online for Organizations Account, ArcGIS Online for Organizations Users, ArcGIS Online for Organizations Credits, Software Media Kit, and Community Analyst.  Additional services include Esri's Enterprise Advantage Program, Right to Call Staff support, Home Use Program, and Street-Map Premium Advanced, US Data Only, Navteq version subscription.  Furthermore, 10P offices will have access to two software as a service portals capable of supporting simultaneous users and a portal maintained on Planning Systems Support Group (PSSG) servers, Tier 2 helpdesk support, and all training offered through Esri's online training library.  An option for an additional copy of StreetMap mapping data is also included.  Once exercised, this data shall be supported for the duration of the contract, including options.  The period of performance shall be November 1, 2015 through October 31, 2016, plus four 12-month option years for continued use and maintenance of GHESS ELA products, if exercised.  

4.  Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C.3304(a)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 entitled, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."  

5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  VA has one of the largest patient and non-patient record data sets in the United States.  The offices of 10P require tools that enable their staff members the ability to analyze and extract meaningful information from these extremely large data sets.  Only Esri's products are capable of handling this vast amount of data.  There is no other GIS Product that can process and analyze the vast amounts of data required, and has sufficient support in place to ensure VA has the required support and software reliability.  Any other similar product would encounter severe performance degradation and software unavailability and downtime as it processes and analyzes this large amount of data.  This extensive amount of data includes the entire enrollee and non-enrollee population, which is about 4 gigabits of data per copy.  VA also has latitude and longitude data for Veteran drive time analysis.  Only Esri's products can process and analyze this amount of data with location allocation or similar techniques.  The location allocation technique is a VA requirement that utilizes algorithms used primarily in a GIS system and allows VA to determine an optimal location for one or more facilities that will service demand for a given set of Veteran data points.  PSSG utilizes this technique to determine Veterans population with types of care needed or other specific needs within VA centers of care.  This technique allows VA to utilize Veteran population and density data in planning efforts of placing sites of care.  For instance, VA can identify a certain area to place a care center at a specific location based on the number of Veterans in that area.  This allows planners to service the most Veterans possible with clinical access.  Without this required functionality which only Esri offers, VA would not be able to strategically place sites of care and provide efficient and effective healthcare to Veterans.  The cornerstone of the GHESS ELA is the unlimited enterprise user license agreement which will grant PSSG the right to deploy and share the products listed in the product description for this effort during the term of the ELA to other 10P offices which are also responsible for planning care initiatives, as well as grant policy makers access to a mutual platform that is non-variable by providing a consistent infrastructure for geo-spatial data development, analysis, cartographic products and access to web services to best access data critical to plan for the needs of Veterans.  No other GIS software manufacturer offers an enterprise license that enables a shared services platform allowing ArcGIS software products to be hosted within the VA network (on premise).  Hosting within the VA network will allow 10P to effectively manage and enforce consistent policies across 10P offices, to conform data use and its integrity and also ensure data security.  In addition, Esri's GIS software is the only software that has the ability to conduct geospatial analytics that will enable 10P users to detect patterns, access trends, generate geographic interactive maps and conduct geo-spatial analytics to conduct deep analysis, create data visualization through maps, and make sound decisions based on trusted concurrent data with ability to share these results among 10P users.  These are VA functional requirements that no other GIS software can provide. 

Additionally, Esri's suite of product licenses and maintenance support provides a solution that is compatible with the existing VA infrastructure and is embedded within current VA business systems.  Currently, VA's GIS infrastructure is based solely upon Esri products, and the entire infrastructure that surrounds the Esri solution has been built to be interoperable with Esri's suite of products, as discussed further below in this justification.  It has taken the PSSG appropriately 15 years to build and develop this current Esri-based infrastructure which is continually expanding.  VA has built customized tools, scripts, and processes that would have to be re-engineered to be utilized on a non-Esri solution.  No other product can work in this environment and communicate with the existing infrastructure.  If any other product were utilized, VA would be unable to utilize many years of embedded regional and national workflow data, and would have to rebuild its current GIS enterprise environment to accommodate new and non-proprietary software.  Any other product would cause VA to lose interoperability, as Esri is the only GIS software that interoperates with Microsoft Office and other products to perform the geospatial analysis as required by VA, such as location allocation techniques.  PSSG's platform must integrate with Microsoft Windows and other Microsoft software products.  This solution leverages the Microsoft Windows platform to provide the infrastructure for geospatial data processing and storage.  This is seamless to the end user, but enables them to have a central, secure location for accessing, designing, managing, and sharing geospatial information without requiring additional processing, storage and network infrastructure.  In addition, ArcGIS interfaces with various Microsoft products such as Microsoft Office and Microsoft SharePoint as well as Microsoft Structured Query Language (SQL),, which accommodates large increases of data and users which enables PSSG to easily and more cost-effectively grow our enterprise system and web applications.  No other source provides this same interoperability with Microsoft products.

The PSSG, through the use of Esri's GIS solution, has developed a prototype Enrollee Drive Time Processor (EDTP) tool that is unique to the industry.  The EDTP tool is used to serve over 8 million enrolled Veterans and over 1100 facilities for defining optimum routes to facilities with proper care.  This tool uses a geocoding process to identify addresses which can then be used by the Esri's ArcGIS analysis tools for determining best routes and other pertinent information.  No other vendor in the market place currently supports the EDTP tool since it was based upon Esri's proprietary ArcGIS suite of products.  Switching to another vendor's GIS software would render the EDTP tool inoperable.  

Furthermore, if another source was available, the entire GIS platform would have to be re-built from multiple different suppliers.  The platform would have to be coded and scripted and a new portal would have to be created.  PSSG would also require a new GIS Services contract to re-write code and scripts so new infrastructure would work across multiple vendor products.  No other source other than Esri can provide the aforementioned services due to proprietary constraints.  Specifically, any other source would need access to Esri's proprietary data in order to ensure that the services provided are properly configured and patched through.  This code ensures that the services provided will allow the ESRI products to remain fully operational and work in the current Esri based environment.  

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:   Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  This effort did not yield any additional sources that can meet the Government's requirements.  There is no competition anticipated for this acquisition.  Additionally, the proposed action will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities Page in accordance with FAR 5.201.  Any proposals that are received shall be evaluated. 

7.   Actions to Increase Competition:  The Government will continue to conduct market research to ascertain if there are changes in the marketplace that would enable future actions to be competed.

8.  Market Research:  The Government's technical experts have performed market research from March through September 2015 by conducting internet queries to determine availability of the required products and support services.  Market Research included companies that could provide Vector based analysis, work within MicrosoftOffice Suite Products, and with Python scripting.  It also included companies that could work with the current GIS tools created specifically for PSSG's unique needs.  All other GIS software products on the market are either limited in products/services selection, have limited spatial analytic capabilities, and/or are limited by a less integrated shared services platform as explained below.

Imagine software is cartographic software, but it fails to meet all of VA's requirements as outlined above.  Specifically, it does not perform vector-based geospatial analysis through points, lines, and polygons with no focus on imagery.  It does not allow for Python scripting, and does not work with Microsoft products.  For example, the software fails to work with SQL and the user cannot download an analysis into Excel or any other similar format that VA is capable of utilizing.  It also does not meet VA's interoperability requirements with the existing ArcGIS infrastructure. 

Hexagon software is cartographic software, but it also fails to meet all of VA's requirements as outlined above.  It does not handle vector-based geospatial analysis through points, lines, and polygons with no focus on imagery or allow for Python scripting.  Its target customer is for remote sensing capabilities such as imagery analysis.  The software focuses more on the size, latitude, and longitude of buildings to support unmanned technologies and drone activity.  It also does not meet VA's interoperability requirements with the existing ArcGIS infrastructure.

Maptitude Mapping Software performs similar functionality; however, it is limited in only polygon format when shape files are needed and does not meet all of VA's requirements as outlined above.  This software has limited layer availability while VA needs a living atlas that is built with content contributed by organizations around the world through the Community Maps Program.  This software cannot handle the large data sets that the VA requires from a vendor.  This software is not integrateable with the already functioning platform in PSSG which would require downloads of Esri products to use.  It also does not meet VA's interoperability requirements with the existing ArcGIS infrastructure.

Esri was the only company found that provided the exact services required by the PSSG.  No other companies were found that could support/offer the services and the support required to work with the VA large data sets, existing computer scripting, and offer an enterprise license. 

9.  Other Facts:  The software and vendor requested represent the industry standard in geographic information systems GIS software.  This software is central to the body of knowledge of all professional geographers, including those employed by Veterans Affairs.  Esri's ArcGIS suite of products is used by federal, state, and local governments as well as the private sector; this software serves all industries that have a geographic analysis component.  The operational impact if an award is not made as requested, is an adverse impact on many key VHA program offices and their associated programs.  These programs include the VA Enrollee Health Care Projection Model, the VHA Health Care Planning Model, the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for Health GIS Planning Portal that serves VHA's Veterans Integrated Service Networks and facilities, the seven VHA/10P GIS Healthcare Enterprise Support and Services program offices, ad-hoc inter-agency collaborations requiring geospatial analyses (e.g. VHA collaborates with Department of Defense and Indian Health Service), and most importantly, GHESS supports Section 101 of the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act (VACAA) of 2014.  GHESS VACAA support leverages robust geoprocessing tools that are unique to Esri's ArcGIS suite of products such as Network Analyst and Spatial Analyst extensions to provide driving distance calculations to nearest site of care for 9+ million enrollees.
