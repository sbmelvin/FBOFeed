<p>FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514</p>
<p>TITLE: Measurement and Signatures Intelligence Exploitation (MASINT-X)</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA-RIK-12-02</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The technical objectives of this BAA are to research innovative, disruptive technologies and methods in Measurement and Signatures Intelligence Exploitation (MASINT-X). The MASINT-X BAA seeks significant advances in the exploitation and reporting of five MASINT sub-disciplines.<br />The five MASINT sub-disciplines of interest to this solicitation include: <br />1. Electro-Optical - Technologies for the detection and exploitation of relevant phenomena by electro-optical sensors to include laser intelligence (LASINT), Overhead Non-imaging Infrared (ONIR), Thermal IR (TIR), and spectroscopy. LASINT technologies may also include sensitive and specific methods of identifying and diagnosing laser eye injuries.</p>
<p>2. RADAR - Technologies to include Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Inverse SAR, Line of Sight (LOS), Over the Horizon (OTH), and bi-static radar.</p>
<p>3. Materials - Technologies to collect, characterize and identify materials, point of origin by remote or close-in means to include nuclear materials, biological threats to include the identification of infectious agents of military importance. Investigations may include improvements in the dissemination of intelligence information to medical personnel through improvements in bioinformatics and data management systems.</p>
<p>4. Radio Frequency - Seek technology to collect, process, and exploit signals intelligence from Ultra Wideband (UWB), Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP), High Power Microwave (HPM), Unintended RF Emissions (URE or RINT) threats.</p>
<p>5. Geophysical - Seek new capabilities for persistent surveillance of areas of interest using seismic, magnetic, acoustic, hydro-acoustic or multi-disciplinary approaches.<br />The innovative MASINT-X technology supporting the sub-disciplines above may require the planning and conducting of field tests to demonstrate the advancement in the specific technology. This includes preparing test plans; acquiring, transporting, deploying, and operating all equipment; operating and measuring ground truth sources; evaluating and monitoring test execution; and documenting all test results.</p>
<p>The MASINT-X capabilities will be required to interface and report to operational systems such as (but not limited to) Distributed Common Ground Systems (DCGS), Defense Information &amp; Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E), and Multimedia Analysis &amp; Archive System (MAAS). The goal of interfacing with these operational systems is twofold; first, provide a more cohesive and complete situational awareness and assessment of enemy activities for on-going US missions, and second, provide surgical cueing for MASINT-X opportunities. Automated knowledge-based tools and decision aids will provide a more effective exploitation of MASINT with its complementary multi-source sensor and intelligence data for improved Situational Awareness. The development of tools and techniques that equip the operational analyst in providing timely and highly accurate signature characterization of signals and objects leading to threat analysis is increasingly critical to MASINT domain issues.</p>
<p>II. AWARD INFORMATION:</p>
<p>Total funding for this BAA is approximately $49.9M. The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 12 - $3.2M; FY 13 - $8.7; FY 14 - $12.35M; FY 15 - $13.1M; and FY16 - $12.55.

<p><br />V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: White papers and proposals will be evaluated through a peer or scientific review process using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, and will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates the detailed approach, development, and testing of the proposed new technology to achieve relevant new capabilities or enhancements, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a Confidential, SECRET or TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET or TOP SECRET information at the time of award. The offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), intends to award a sole source contract to the Hektoen Institute for Medical Research, 2240 W. Ogden Ave., 2nd Floor, Chicago, IL 60612 for the acquisition of the Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Three Year Follow-up.<br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology), Size standard 500. The period of performance for this procurement is 24 months. <br /><br />The purpose of this acquisition is to conduct a review of the medical records of participants enrolled in the Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) for Routine Screening for Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) for the three years after enrollment to establish and compare the number and type of diagnoses of ambulatory and emergency room visits, and hospitalizations by study group. This project will also establish the number of deaths and type of diagnoses occurring among the RCT of IPV screening participants within a two-year period from time of enrollment.
<p><br />Considering the magnitude and severity of intimate partner violence (IPV), and the potential role health care providers could play in reducing its serious consequences, numerous professional and health care organizations have recommended routine screening of women for IPV in primary care settings. However, various systematic reviews of the literature have not found evidence on which to base this recommendation. This lack of evidence led an expert panel, convened by the CDC in February of 2005, to recommend that a randomized controlled trial be conducted to establish the effectiveness of screening on women's health. As a result, in 2008, CDC contracted with the Hektoen Institute for Medical Research to conduct the first Randomized Controlled Trial of Routine Screening for Intimate Partner Violence. This acquisition builds on the previous RCT. Conducting a three-year follow-up focusing on morbidity and two-year follow-up of mortality will provide stronger evidence for or against the effectiveness of screening of women in primary care settings for IPV.</p>
<p>Hektoen is the administrative agent for research awards to John H. Stroger Hospital (flagship hospital of Cook County Bureau of Health and Hospital Services) investigators. Hektoen obtained informed consent forms from 2,700 participants for the RCT. These informed consent included permission to access participants' medical records and was approved by both CDC IRB and Cook County Bureau of Health and Hospital Services IRB. Therefore, Hektoen Institute for Medical Research is the only one that can meet the project requirements.</p>
<p>In addition to the fact that only the researchers appearing on the informed consent approved by the IRBs have permission to access the IPV screening RCT participants' medical records, Hektoen has ample experience in conducting medical record review.</p>
<p>Lastly, providing participant's identifying information to another vendor would violate confidentiality agreements established in the informed consent. Therefore, to conduct a longer follow-up of a screening intervention would require a new RCT which, given the requirements to obtain IRB and OMB approvals and the need for pilot testing procedures, would mean having results approximately six years from now at a cost almost eight times greater than the current cost.<br /><br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to the Hektoen Institute for Medical Research However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Vallerie Redd <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">via email ONLY</span></strong> at gfj3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2012-N-14285 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN April 7, 2012.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting synopsis  and solicitations on the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Either site may be used to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA). NAVSEA intends to issue Solicitation N00024-12-R-4321 for execution planning and accomplishment of CNO scheduled Dry-docking Availabilities and Non Dry-docking availabilities for CVN 65 (USS ENTERPRISE), CVN 68, and CVN 78 Class Aircraft Carriers home-ported in and visiting Puget Sound, WA.
 The requirements include execution planning, accomplishment of CNO scheduled availabilities and continuous/emergent maintenance efforts. A cost plus award fee/incentive fee is contemplated. The Navy intends to electronically post Solicitation N00024-12-R-4321 in early April 2012 at the following websites: http://www.fbo.gov and http://www.neco.navy.mil.

<DESC>TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE UNREGULATED CONTAMINANT MONITORING REGULATION AND DRINKING WATER STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT (SOL-CI-12-00010)
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires contractor support to provide technical, analytical, and administrative support services for the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Regulation (UCMR).  The Agency has the responsibility to investigate chemical and microbiological contaminant occurrence to characterize drinking water threats.  EPA relies on independent research efforts but also is heavily engaged in conducting occurrence studies to obtain new data.  The largest of these is the monitoring program mandated by the UCMR.  The UCMR is a cyclic monitoring program that allows the Office of Ground Water Drinking Water (OGWDW) to evaluate contaminant occurrence in finished drinking water.  Every five years EPA selects, through the process of regulatory proposal and promulgation, a new group of contaminants for monitoring.  Data collected under UCMR can then be correlated with the consumer population to conduct an assessment of contaminant exposure.  This assessmen t supports OGDW?s mandate to make determinations on the regulation of currently unregulated contaminants.
The RFP SOL-CI-12-00010 will be solicited as a total small business set-aside.  The applicable NAICS code designation for the acquisition is 541620 with a size standard of $14 million.  The Government anticipates award of a single Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF)-Term contract from this solicitation with a base year and five option years.  The period of performance for the resultant contract is anticipated to begin on or about August 1, 2012.  This is a follow-on to contract EP-C-06-041.
The solicitation is expected to be issued no earlier than April 9, 2012 on EPA?s website: http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.  This office does not intend to mail hard copies of the solicitation.  It is the responsibility of the offerors to frequently check the EPA website for updates or changes.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.  Contract award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting Negotiation.
Due to unavoidable organizational conflict of interests, the Government will exclude any entities that own or operate a certified analytical laboratory facility that performs drinking water monitoring and sample analysis for the UCMR and are therefore considered ineligible for award of this contract (See http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd).  A draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) and draft Conflict of Interest Clauses can be obtained from the OAM website, http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/.  The PWS and draft clauses are not final in nature but reflect EPA?s intentions at this time.
The point of contact for this solicitation is Courtney Stallworth, Contract Specialist, USEPA, 26 W. Martin Luther King Drive, Mail Code: NWD-001, Cincinnati, OH 45268, who may be reached via email at stallworth.courtney@epa.gov or via telephone at (513)487-2002.

-	Pressure wire must be compatible with VOLCANO Intravascular Imaging Technology and Functional Measurement System
-	The pressure wire provides instant integration of crucial FFR data directly into recording system for simplified cath lab workflow
-	The pressure wires for the measurement system are needed urgently in support of upcoming scheduled cardiac catherization procedures.  If these pressure wires are not purchased immediately, it could result in greater damage or death to the patient.  It could also lengthen the patient's stay and delay proper treatment.   The existing fractional flow reserve measurement system only uses pressure wires compatible with the VOLCANO Intravascular Imaging Technology and Functional Measurement System.  The measurement system uses new technology that allows physicians more control when assessing complex coronary lesions.  This increases efficacy and efficiency of coronary revascularization

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. This RFI is issued for the purpose of developing a viable solicitation that will best communicate the Government's requirements to industry. Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary and will not affect any corporation's ability to submit an offer if and when a solicitation is released. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of the submission of contractors' information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION. The 772 Enterprise Sourcing Squadron (ESS) in conjunction with the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), Lackland Air Force Base, TX, is planning to contract with Architect-Engineer (A-E) firms to perform worldwide and regional Title I, Title II, and other A-E services to administer, coordinate, and technically support Environmental, Military Construction (MILCON), Military Family Housing (MFH), and Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization (SRM) programs of interest to the government.</p>
<p>We anticipate multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract awards and anticipate using NAICS codes 541330. The small business size standard associated with NAICS code 541330 is $4.5M. Previous 4P A-E contracts have used NAICS code 562910. The small business size standard associated with NAICS code 562910 is 500 employees. We anticipate awarding approximately 10-20 contracts to large and small businesses. We are contemplating regionalizing contracts for services for CONUS (defined as the lower 48 states, Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. territories) installations and dedicating suites of small business IDIQ contracts to each region in addition to awarding suites of worldwide contracts. The scope of A-E services (i.e. Title I/II &amp; Other) will be similar for all contracts. However the TYPE of projects/programs (i.e. MILCON, MFH, SRM) is anticipated to differ between the worldwide and regional IDIQ suites.</p>
<p>We anticipate the development of two separate Statements of Work (SOW), one for worldwide IDIQ awards and one for regional IDIQ awards. However for this RFI the attached DRAFT SOW covers all anticipated services and project/program efforts. The attached DRAFT SOW has changed substantially from the current AFCEE 4PA-E08 SOW. Sections 8.0, 13.2 and 14.0 are examples of scope areas that have been significantly revised or updated. Recommend review of entire SOW. All sub-categories of small businesses are being looked at during our market research phase. At this time, we are considering that task orders under these contracts will be negotiated as either Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), Time &amp; Materials (T&amp;M) or Firm Fixed Price (FFP) orders, depending on the nature of the requirement. Additionally, we anticipate that each contract will have a basic ordering period of five (5) years with three additional years for performance. Central Contract Registration (CCR) will be mandatory for these contracts (see CCR website at www.ccr.gov).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND AND PROGRAM INFORMATION. These IDIQ contracts will serve to functionally replace services contained within AFCEE's existing Worldwide Planning, Program, and Design (4P A-E08) contracts. The ordering period under the 4P A-E08 contracts expire during the Feb - Aug 2013 timeframe. <br />ANTICIPATED GENERAL SCOPE OF WORLDWIDE SERVICES<br />To provide Title I, Title II, and Other A-E Services for environmental and traditional MILCON, Military Family Housing (including projects related to Privatized Housing), and SRM projects.

<DESC>Foreign Light Weight Barrel Technology Sources Sought
The Army Contracting Command  New Jersey, Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey is interested in determining the state of the art/ practice of readily available foreign barrel technologies that reduce overall barrel weight but still maintain its lethality and survivability features. 
The purpose of conducting this survey is to identify potential sources of foreign types of readily available barrel making technologies that shall reduce overall barrel weight and dimension while maintaining the required muzzle velocities and design safety factors associated with existing barrels.  The two overarching objectives of this research effort are to 1) ascertain the short term viability (less than one year) of implementing the light weight barrel technologies for low rate of fire weapon systems such as bolt action sniper rifles and 2) quantify and characterize limitations and tradeoffs associated with light weight barrel technologies.  The tradeoff characteristics associated with system performance that government will seek to evaluate   are: accuracy and dispersion, heat dissipation, erosion, barrel harmonics, muzzle velocity, endurance and recoil.  Potential foreign barrel candidates shall meet the following criteria:
1)	Readiness Level:  Design is ready to work in its final form and under expected conditions and the manufacturer currently has the required tooling/machinery to fabricate and deliver small sample quantities within 90 days after contract award for Government evaluation.  The manufacturers existing technical data currently provides sufficient information to support fabrication of prototype material (Developmental Design Drawings) and production processes are mature enough to reliably fabricate samples for evaluation.  (See MIL-DTL-31000C, section 3.6.1 for Developmental and Product drawing definitions).
2)	Technology/Technical Approach:  Weight reduction that is accomplished solely by removing steel from a barrel (e.g. fluting, tapering) does not apply to this source sought announcement.  The Government is interested in the use of alternative barrel materials and/or processes to include, but not limited to, carbon fiber wrapped or low density alloy composite barrels and/or new manufacturing methods that enable the use of alternative barrel alloys to reduce weight and maintain or improve barrel stiffness.
3)	Caliber:  Chambered to accommodate a .300 Winchester Magnum caliber cartridge.
4)	Interface:  Must be fabricated in a way to interface with a Remington 700 action.
5)	Length:  The technology and processes must be such that fabrication of barrels 22 6 inches is achievable.
6)	Muzzle Break Interface:  The technology, design, and process must be such that external threads can be machined near the crown of the barrel to accommodate commercially available muzzle break/sound suppressor assemblies.
7)	High Pressure Resistance:  All barrels should be able to safely accommodate high pressure events which will be validated by firing proof rounds that conform to ANSI/SAAMI 2299.4

<DESC>Domestic Light Weight Barrel Technology Sources Sought
The Army Contracting Command  New Jersey, Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey is interested in determining the state of the art/ practice of readily available domestic barrel technologies that reduce overall barrel weight but still maintain its lethality and survivability features. 
The purpose of conducting this survey is to identify potential sources of domestic types of readily available barrel making technologies that shall reduce overall barrel weight and dimension while maintaining the required muzzle velocities and design safety factors associated with existing barrels.  The two overarching objectives are to 1) ascertain the short term viability (less than one year) of implementing the light weight barrel technologies for low rate of fire weapon systems such as bolt action sniper rifles and 2) quantify and characterize limitations and tradeoffs associated with light weight barrel technologies.  The tradeoff characteristics associated with system performance that government may seek to evaluate are: accuracy and dispersion, heat dissipation, erosion, barrel harmonics, muzzle velocity, endurance and recoil.  Potential foreign barrel candidates shall meet the following criteria:
1)	Readiness Level:  Design is ready to work in its final form and under expected conditions and the manufacturer currently has the required tooling/machinery to fabricate and deliver small sample quantities within 90 days after contract award for Government evaluation.  The manufacturers existing technical data currently provides sufficient information to support fabrication of prototype material (Developmental Design Drawings) and production processes are mature enough to reliably fabricate samples for evaluation.  (See MIL-DTL-31000C, section 3.6.1 for Developmental and Product drawing definitions).
2)	Technology/Technical Approach:  Weight reduction that is accomplished solely by removing steel from a barrel (e.g. fluting, tapering) does not apply to this source sought announcement.  The Government is interested in the use of alternative barrel materials and/or processes to include, but not limited to, carbon fiber wrapped or low density alloy composite barrels and/or new manufacturing methods that enable the use of alternative barrel alloys to reduce weight and maintain or improve barrel stiffness.
3)	Caliber:  Chambered to accommodate a .300 Winchester Magnum caliber cartridge.
4)	Interface:  Must be fabricated in a way to interface with a Remington 700 action.
5)	Length:  The technology and processes must be such that fabrication of barrels from 22  6 inches is achievable.
6)	Muzzle Break Interface:  The technology, design, and process must be such that external threads can be machined near the crown of the barrel to accommodate commercially available muzzle break/sound suppressor assemblies.
7)	High Pressure Resistance:  All barrels should be able to safely accommodate high pressure events which will be validated by firing proof rounds that conform to ANSI/SAAMI 2299.4

<DESC>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency&rsquo;s (DTRA) is seeking firms with capabilities to provide services to operate the Defense Threat Reduction Information Analysis Center (DTRIAC). The DTRIAC provides a suite of analysis products and services to support the Science and Technology (S&amp;T) community of practice with S&amp;T Information (STI). The Information Analysis Center (IAC) maintains, acquires, digests, synthesizes, stores and publishes information, and provides services concerning STI and engineering data. Using analysis tools and methodologies, the IAC's comprehensive knowledge base supports a variety of subject matter experts investigating STI related information from a broad pool of sources to include DTRA mission areas; nuclear, biological, chemical (NBC), and other special weapons, cooperative threat reduction (CTR) programs, arms control treaty monitoring and on-site inspection, force protection, NBC defense, and counter-proliferation (CP). The IAC provides technical support on weapons of mass destruction (WMD) matters to the DoD components. In partnership with other national and international S&amp;T communities, this IAC has also provided support to non-DoD customers in the Federal Government, other federal Government contractors, and other authorized customers. These services provide DTRA the opportunity to serve as an information conduit to support our national and international collaborative effort in the fight against terrorism. One key to success in this new global environment is the need to digitize this information and make it accessible through a secure remote access. The Scientific and Technology information Archival and Retrieval System (STARS), using Commercial of the shelf software, is the current Information Technology (IT) tool that accomplishes this. The IAC has two inter-related activities; Core, which includes the day-to-day analysis and support activities, and Technical Area Tasks (TAT), which provides more extensive operational support. Core Activities include the following: Maintain the existing DTRIAC data collection (which includes all forms of media) and pursue an aggressive program to expand and update this collection. Protect, preserve, and store classified and unclassified STI from all appropriate sources. Handle and preserve a large collection of aging films that require testing for deterioration and methods to prolong their shelf life until able to be preserved. Handle and preserve records and information collections per classification requirements. Maintain a comprehensive STI knowledge base consisting of data in multiple formats and forms, utilizing a variety of state-of-the-art IT tools. Transmit products created through a variety of mediums to customers in a timely manner. Provide detailed responses to technical inquiries for information to assist customers in their research within the scope of DTRA mission areas. Respond to Freedom of Information Act requests. Digitize, using modern scanning techniques, the vast amount of archived STI and make it accessible to all qualified customers via a secure remote access. Develop, integrate, and maintain changes/upgrades to any supporting IT tool to ensure it keeps pace with commercial development of similar systems. Provide support to the DTRA Defense Nuclear Weapons School (DNWS) to include the maintenance, inventory and control of all historical properties of the Nuclear Weapons Instructional Museum (NWIM) as well as providing tours and related NWIM instruction to customers and DNWS instructors/personnel. Provide a curator with knowledge of nuclear weapons maintenance, storage, security, surety employment, and command and control systems, who is responsible for the acquisition, reconditioning and management of exhibits for the NWIM. Provide routine inquiry and daily analysis services to the DTRA mission areas. Provide support to the DTRA STI Program to include technical editors to assist in tracking and processing STI reports generated by DTRA to include such tasks as reviewing draft technical reports for proper format submitted by authors; verifying the reports are editorially correct and all required information is included; annotating the draft for preparation of the camera-ready copy, inserting required security classification marking and assisting government and contractors in creating acceptable data deliverables based on established standards. Managing and maintaining the STINT Tracking Database. Technical Area Tasks (TATs) Activities include the following: (see sample TAT for example of work that could be accomplished under the contract) Provide analysis support to IAC customers who require specialized efforts on threat reduction related topics of very narrow technical focus and applicability, and that require greater depth, specialization and time than is available as part of the core activities. They include studies, analyses, assembly of data collections, and development of tools and techniques for the collection and analysis of data, as well as other unique scientific and technical activities. Potential sources having the capability necessary to assist DTRA in satisfying the above requirements are invited to provide information demonstrating their capabilities. Information submitted should detail the organization&rsquo;s experience and expertise in the areas identified above, to include details regarding potential key personnel and their qualifications. Responses shall also include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, email address, business size and small business status (if applicable), teaming partners and/or major subcontractors. It is requested that capability statements be limited to ten pages in length using a font no less than Times New Roman, 12 point. Services may be procured using an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract with multiple awardees, with a period of performance not to exceed 10 years. Scanning and digitization services may be separated from the overall effort, therefore, firms with scanning and digitization capabilities may submit capability statements addresssing only those areas. Please submit responses, no later than April 6, 2012 to Ms. Margaret LeBlanc at margaret.leblanc@dtra.mil. This synopsis is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a request for proposal, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government.

<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Office of Acquisitions and Grants Services (OAGS), Division of Acquisition Operations (DAO) is seeking to identify sources with capabilities and prior experience in developing Food Safety Guidance Writing.</p>
<p>FDA makes no implied or in fact contract by issuing this Sources Sought. Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the FDA's view of the information received. Material that requires a non-disclosure agreement or that may be business sensitive will not be accepted. Please note that responses to this notice will not be returned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Project Title: Food Safety Guidance Writing</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>On January 4, 2011, President Barack Obama signed into law the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA; Pub. L. 111- 353), which requires the owner, operator, or agent in charge of a facility required to register under section 415 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 350d) to take certain actions, including to evaluate the hazards that could affect food manufactured, processed, packed, or held and to implement preventive controls to significantly minimize or prevent the occurrence of such hazards. A written plan must be prepared to describe the procedures used by the facility to comply. FSMA also mandates that FDA establish science- and risk-based standards for growing, harvesting, packing, and holding produce on farms. FDA plans to issue proposed regulations on hazard analysis and preventive controls for human foods and standards for produce safety.</p>
<p>FDA is required to issue guidance that will explain the requirements of the proposed preventive controls regulation with respect to the various components of the food safety plan, including how to do a hazard analysis and determine appropriate preventive controls. Guidance to industry is most useful when those using it can apply the guidance to the specific foods being produced and processes used to produce those foods.</p>
<p>FDA is also required to issue an updated good agricultural practices guidance and guidance for the safe production and harvesting of produce. The updated good agricultural practices guidance would take into account the science and technology developments in the area of produce safety since the Agency issued its Good Agricultural Practices Guidance in 1998. This broad-based guidance would serve to encourage safe practices by fresh produce firms, including those that will be exempted either entirely or in part from compliance with the produce safety regulation.</p>
<p>Scope</p>
<p>Given the diversity of registered facilities and regulated foods, FDA is seeking assistance in the development of such food type-specific guidance documents to assist the food industry in complying with the preventive controls regulations, when finalized. FDA is interested in information on how to group foods subject to the regulation into categories with similar hazards and controls, as well as guidance specific to those food categories.</p>
<p>FDA is seeking assistance in the development of guidance for safe production and harvesting of produce. The guidance for safe would serve as companion guidance to the produce rule and include recommendations to facilitate industry implementation and compliance with the regulation. This guidance would include information about hazards associated with growing, harvesting, packing, and holding of all produce covered by the produce safety regulation.</p>
<p>Responses must include capability statements and duns number be sent to this notice no later than 10:00 a.m. EST on April 6, 2012 submitted by email to vida.niles@fda.hhs.gov,Vida Niles, Contract Specialist for consideration. Responses to this announcement will not be returned, nor will there be any ensuing discussions or debriefings of any responses. However, information obtained as a result of this announcement may be reflected in the subsequent solicitation, and FDA may contact one or more respondents for clarifications and to enhance the Government's understanding. This announcement is Government market research, and may result in revisions in both its requirements and its acquisition strategy based on industry responses.<br />NO TELEPHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, 2250 Leestown Road, Lexington, KY has a requirement for the following services:  Provide all necessary architectural and engineering services required to prepare Schematic Design (SD) Development, Design Development (DD), Construction Documents (CD) and Bid Documents, for Project No. 596-12-103 "Renovate Prosthetics" located at the Leestown Division Lexington, KY VAMC.  Design period services shall include drawings, specifications, and cost estimate reflecting specific tasks identified therein, in addition to on-site meetings with professional and administrative staff, site investigative work and review of existing documents.   AE staff and consultants shall be adequately knowledgeable of the various subordinate design disciplines, including but not limited to, IH, MEP, structural, fire protection, life safety, and other building/utility systems required.

This project will renovate approximately 3,400 SF of space in Building 1 Ground floor for Prosthetics. The project will right size the Prosthetics Department at the Leestown Division by repurposing space between Prosthetics and the adjacent Phlebotomy room (Phlebotomy space will be vacated in a transitional move out). Renovation will include reconfiguration of the floor plan to also resolve privacy issues and updates to architectural finishes, electrical, mechanical, and fire protection systems. 

The consultant shall include design for UFAS compliance for possible revised building entries and toilets along with other aspects of accessible design. Replacement of deteriorated mechanical and plumbing system piping is to be evaluated and included. Consultant will be designing for energy efficiency so replacement of lighting and inclusion of lighting alternates shall be part of the services. In addition the floors in the building may require removal and new finishes if budget allows. Project should include the evaluation of the heating and cooling system to meet current VAMC requirements especially pertaining to exhaust and outside air.

A/E shall subcontract to an independent fire protection engineering firm, approved by the VA, or expertise as part of the design and construction, licensed in the state of Kentucky, to perform an independent Contract Document Review consisting of the engineering design drawings and specifications for fire protection systems such as building sprinkler system, fire alarm, other fire protection equipment, and Building Life Safety requirements.  The independent firm shall submit a fire plan review, First Submission for the Design Development submission, since the plans and DRAFT specifications will be developed at that position in order to have a fire safety prevention effect and avoid any costly change orders to the facility and a Second/Final Submission at the Construction Document submission to finalize or follow-up on the fire plan review recommendations affecting the outcome of the engineering project at the facility.

Asbestos Containing Materials are present in Buildings 1. The VA will provide past survey documents for the buildings; however, it has been determined that the information is not reliable for a project of this type. The consultant will provide testing and design services for mitigation of asbestos containing materials for the areas involved in the renovation. This will also include mitigation of asbestos containing materials in the crawl space of Building 1 if any construction or demolition work is required.

Digital copies of the as-builts are limited. The consultant will be expected to fully investigate and confirm the validity of hard copy as-builts and other drawings. This will include independent investigation of the VAMC's flat files by the consultant to determine and procure the information required for the complete design.

Project design shall clearly show work required, phasing of work required, and instructions to construction contractor regarding how to accomplish the necessary renovations in a 24/7 medical environment taking into consideration demolition, dust control, infection control, and specialized facility requirements as discussed with VA staff.  Also included will be limitations, e.g. work required to be completed outside of standard administrative hours, work limited to periods shorter than a single shift, etc., for specific locations in the project.  Bid deductions will be built into the scope of work of the project to allow for flexibility in construction award.
The contract completion for bid document submission will be 150 calendar days from Notice to Proceed and 540 calendar days for completion of construction.

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.  However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Total and Broad Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		9905-00-NIB-0342<br />Name:		Tape, Barricade, Red, "DANGER", Economy Grade, 3"W x 1000'L<br />Description:	Non-adhesive barricade tape, red, with "DANGER" in all capital, black lettering.

<p>NSN:		9905-00-NIB-0343<br />Name:		Tape, Barricade, Yellow, "CAUTION", Economy Grade, 3"W x 1000'L<br />Description:	Non-adhesive barricade tape, yellow, with "CAUTION" in all capital, black lettering.

<p>NSN:		9905-00-NIB-0344<br />Name:		Tape, Barricade, Yellow, "CAUTION", Premium Grade, 3"W x 1000'L<br />Description:	Non-adhesive barricade tape, yellow, with "CAUTION" in all capital, black lettering. Tape is made of premium grade polyethylene, 3"W X 1000'L. Packaged in cardboard dispenser box that prevents the tape from unraveling during use or storage. UoI is RO.</p>
<p>NSN:		9905-01-282-2285<br />Name:		Tape, Barricade<br />Description:	3" wide, Barricade tape, "Caution Do Not Enter" printed in black letters on yellow background. UoI is RO.</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the General Services Administration, Fort Worth, TX.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are:</p>

<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than April 6, 2012 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to&nbsp;(703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.

Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition
as required by FAR 6.302-1, 6.303/304, and 13.501(a)(ii

1. Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 23, MVAHCS Medical Center, Minneapolis VA Health Care System, One Veterans Drive, Minneapolis, M.N. 55417, Network 23 Contracting Office (NCO 23), 708 South Third Street, Suite 200E, Minneapolis, MN 55415; 618-12-2-109-1396

2. Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  Justification and approval for other than full and open competition for purchasing United States Postage to mail pharmacy requests to patients. The government estimated cost of this proposal is $100,000.00 at the time of award.

3. Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  Purchase postage for outpatient mailing.

4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  41 USC 253(g), as implemented by FAR 6.302.  Far 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
5. Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   a. Only One Responsible Source (FAR 6.302-1) Accordingly, the United States Postal Service is the only firm capable of providing the supplies and services described in Section III above without the Veteran's Health Administration experiencing substantial duplication of cost that could not be expected to be recovered through competition. 

6. Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  Citing the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1),  and FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." Since it is this survey of the market place that confirms our assumptions regarding the capability of industry to meet our needs, accordingly, market research was conducted by Special Notice of the proposed acquisition on FedBizOpps.

7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  Price is set by the United States Postal Service.  This is considered fair and reasonable.

8. Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  As described in Section VI above, market research, in accordance with FAR Part 10, was conducted by Special Notice of the proposed acquisition, advising industry of the pending acquisition and soliciting inquiries from interested parties.

9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  N/A

10. Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  None

11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  None, because the United States Postal Service is the only source for the services and supplies required.

12. Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<p><br />II. Project Information</p>
<p>Title: New Service Maintenance Agreement for Hologic, Inc. Bone Densitometry scanner that is coming off of original equipment manufacturer warranty; new installation was 3/2011. <br /><br />POTS Requisition No. 12-007025</p>
<p>Proposed Contractor: Hologic, Inc. <br />35 Crosby Drive<br />Bedford, MA 01730<br />Karl Schmidt, Service Sales<br />610-440-0313 (home office)<br />484-951-6140 (cell)<br />610-440-2264 (fax)<br />kschmidt@hologic.com</p>
<p>III. Project Background and Description<br />The Radiology &amp; Imaging Sciences Department, Nuclear Medicine purchased a new "Discovery A" Bone Densitometry Unit from Hologic, Inc. (The Women's Health Company, aka "Hologic") in 2010, with installation occurring in March, 2011. This system is now coming off of the manufacturer's warranty and must be covered by a service maintenance agreement. This unit was purchased in order to replace two (2) aged Hologic Bone Densitometry units. <br />A sole source vendor service maintenance agreement (SMA) would support on-going research studies that have utilized similar equipment and proprietary software databases. The purchase of a new Bone Densitometry unit from Hologic ensured the seamless correlation for longitudinal research studies/protocols, as well as provided for improved and timely patient imaging. The purchase will also permitted improved data transmission between Nuclear Medicine and the Radiology Information System (RIS) and CRIS systems, thus providing improved patient care and research support. This capability is especially important when one considers the enormous amount of research data that must be converted to be usable with the new acquisition system and workstation. <br />There are few vendors for this type of equipment and so it is vital to have the original manufacturer provide the service necessary to maintain the equipment at optimal functionality. Hardware and software updates are often required to keep the equipment functionality at a state-of-art level. Some software can be proprietary to the vendor but vitally necessary to ensure that data comparisons are not compromised. <br />IV. Government Cost Estimate <br />The cost is $8,797.50 per year based on:<br />Agreement Number 1232012 Direct; Dated 01/23/2012 <br />V. Prior and Future Contracts<br />This vendor's service has been in use by the department for over 10 years on prior models of similar equipment. <br />Part II - Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition <br />I. Statutory Authority<br />The sole source acquisition is justified under the statutory authority contained in U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and the following authority contemplated by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2). "When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for."<br />II. Justification<br />Hologic, Inc., a Family of Companies (aka "Hologic"), proposes to offer a service maintenance agreement for the following piece of equipment, which is located within the Radiology and Imaging Sciences Department, Nuclear Medicine (NM): 1) the "Discovery A" bone densitometry unit. This piece of equipment was originally purchased through Hologic, as the original equipment manufacturer and sole service provider. <br />Hologic will provide new release operating software and upgrades to software as developed and when necessary to maintain this equipment at high operational standards, which diminishes the untimely obsolescence of imaging equipment. These software packages, physician workstation, acquisition terminal and imaging scanner equipment are in daily use by the Radiology and Imaging Sciences Department, Nuclear Medicine section. Nuclear Medicine is requesting this service maintenance agreement for the Hologic Bone Densitometry unit, on a sole source basis for the following reasons:<br />&bull; The Hologic operating and applications software, a component covered by the service maintenance agreement, have been found to work well with the current RAD&amp;IS and PACS daily workflow.<br />&bull; As a product line developed and maintained by Hologic, the operating and applications software, physician workstation, operating console and imaging scanner are only available from Hologic. Only Hologic has the rights to this copyrighted product line. Hologic is the only provider of updates, upgrades and technical support for this product line. <br />&bull; As a product developed and maintained by Hologic, only Hologic has the knowledge base and support services required to maintain this product line.<br />&bull; Hologic has proven to be a reliable service provider.</p>
<p><br />Program Office Certification<br />This is to certify that the portions of this justification that have been developed by the undersigned program office personnel, including supporting information and/or data verifying the Government's minimum needs, schedule requirements and other rationale for other than full and open competition, are accurate and complete.<br />Official Name &amp; Title Signature Date<br />Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) Roberto Maass-Moreno, PhD<br /><br />Radiology and Imaging Sciences<br />Nuclear Medicine<br /><br />COTR's Immediate Supervisor <br />Head of the Sponsoring Program Office <br />Clara C. Chen, MD - Chief Clinical Studies Section, Nuclear Medicine, Radiology and Imaging Sciences&#8232;</p>
<p>Contracting Officer's Certification <br />This is to certify that the justification for the proposed acquisition has been reviewed and that to the best of my knowledge and belief the information and/or data provided to support the rationale and recommendation for approval is accurate and complete.</p>

The lab has the need for several types of rodent (rats and mice) behavioral chambers for their research into the mechanism of addiction. These chambers will be used to train animals to perform reward-learning experiments (i.e. cocaine self-administration). All chambers require end users to be fluent in its unique programming language. Operant chambers will not function properly without extensive knowledge of the system's proprietary programming language. The laboratory has over 5 years of experience with Med Associate equipment and within this period, we have developed the expertise and a unique set of programs that we routinely use in our research protocols. In addition, because we will need to sync many of the behavioral outputs with other third-party equipments (i.e. lasers, electrophysiological recording), we know that Med Associates will be able to custom build adapters that will enable us to perform these intricate experiments. Lastly, over 80% of behavioral research laboratories (including labs at the NIDA IRP) use Med Associate equipment, there is a substantial knowledge base that we can access. This extensive network of Med Associate users will be of great help should we encounter any problems. For these compelling reasons, the Med Associates system is the only one that will meet our strict needs and the NIDA IRP must establish a sole source agreement with Med Associates.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Intramural Research Program (IRP) intends to solicit, negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with Noldus Information Technology, Inc. 1503 Edwards Ferry Road, Suite 201 Leesburg, Virginia 20176. The National Institutes on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Division of Intramural Research in Baltimore, Maryland. The Gardner/Xi laboratory has the need for video tracking software for their research into the mechanism of addiction. This software will enable real-time monitoring and analysis of in vivo optogenetic experiments. Two licenses are required separate chambers for rats and mice. The Bonci laboratory has extensive experience with Noldus software and has developed the expertise and a unique set of parameters optimized for efficient monitoring and quantifying behavioral movements. Bonci lab members will support the Gardner/Xi lab to quickly set up this system to perform optogenetic behavioral research. The Catwalk system is used to assess gait in rodents. The multiparameter measurements allow for identification of changes to an animals gait in response to injury, disease or drug exposure. Our group will use this as an objective measure of impaired gait as a consequence of stroke, chronic methamphetamine or other lesions to the dopaminergic system. Importantly, it can be used to assess recovery from such injuries. In addition, it can be used as a behavioral assessment of "impairment" for animals self administering drugs. For example, for self administration of drug in rodents, it could be used to examine the effects of the administered drug e.g. alcohol or cocaine on gait. The sensitivity of the assay would help to identify modest impairments. The equipment can be housed in one of our rooms or could be placed in the behavioral core if space allowed. No equipment of this type currently exists and it would be a strong asset to our studies and other studies of substance abuse. No substitutions should be made.

<DESC>In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) part 8.002(a) (1) Priorities for use of Government supply sources and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), the U.S. Census Bureau intends to award on a noncompetitive basis a purchase order with the Ohio Addressing Machine Company for six Kirk Rudy Model 550 Labeling Head Labeling Systems, six vacuum bases, six labeling kits, shipping, installation and training to be used to support the National Processing Center (NPC). Kirk Rudy Labeling Systems have been tested against other labeling systems and only the Kirk Rudy Systems are uniquely qualified to provide the support needed for processing the Economic Census. The U.S. Census Bureau has determined that the Kirk Rudy Labeling Systems are the only known source which is capable in the consistent placement of labels within less than .0625 of an inch onto the required location to be used to support the NPC Economic Census. Placement of label is critical due to the specific location of adhesive, the address window and the tight Postal regulations. The intent of this synopsis is for information purposes only and is not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitations will be issued. Information received regarding this announcement will only be considered solely for the purpose of conducting competitive procurements in the future. Inquiries may be addressed to Tina M.

<SUBJECT>BAO Kit Operational Control System
<SOLNBR>FA8629-12-R-2417
<RESPDATE>042012
<CONTACT>Nancy G. Leggett, Contracting Officer, Phone (937) 255-1696, Fax (937) 255-8351, Email nancy.leggett@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC>1. The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) is soliciting proposals for initial purchase of ten (10) and up to 300 additional BAO Kit Operational Control Systems (OCS). 2. This combined solicitation/synopsis for commercial items was prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Solicitation FA8629-12-R-2417 is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP), using the streamlined procedures for evaluation of commercial items as outlined in FAR 12.6. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-28. The associated NAICS code is 335999. 3. The purpose of the Battlefield Air Operations Kit (BAO Kit) program is to upgrade the current equipment suite of the Battlefield Airmen (BA) in five (5) different areas &ndash; communications, computers, human input/output (human I/O), power generation and management and software. As such, it is also part of the broader BA program, currently addressing requirements for Combat Control Teams (CCT), Special Tactics Squadrons (STS), Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) personnel and Guardian Angel pararescue personnel. The OCS consists of a wearable vest with cable runs, cables, power manager and computer, thereby incorporating the areas of computers, power generation and management and communications. The primary radio for the BAO Kit is the AN/PRC-117G radio manufactured by Harris RF. When carried, the battery can provide power for the entire BAO Kit. Specifications for the battery connector are included in Attachment 2 to this RFP. The Battery end of the cable will be a 90 degree elbow connector that conforms to the side of the battery. 4. The intended use of this system is in military field operations in a range of environmental conditions. The expected system life cycle before replacement required is two-years -- notwithstanding catastrophic damage or other than normal wear, use and transportation. Operating conditions include environmental ranges as described in the specification below but can be described as continuous wear and operations by military personnel for the durations specified below in dismounted on-the-ground conditions, operation in military and commercial ground vehicles, and transportation either being worn or removed in various aircraft and helicopters. Personnel should not be encumbered by the system snagging on vehicle parts when either wearing or carrying the system while entering or exiting vehicles and aircraft. Usage environments can be expected to stress the systems&rsquo; integration, fasteners, belts, and pockets. The OCS is expected to be easy for operators to quickly don and remove in various postures (standing, sitting and prone). While being worn, the OCS should not impede other wearer actions such as arm freedom of movement required to operate shoulder-fired weapons, climb, and fast rope. Warranty logistics and depot repair operations will be managed by the vendor with ready spares to replace any failed systems returned for repair. Continuity of operations in the field will be managed by the Government. 5. Because this is an evaluation effort, the Air Force may award up to four (4) contracts under this effort. Or, the Air Force may determine to award no contracts at all, depending upon the responses received. In the future, the Air Force may proceed with a follow-on procurement, depending on the results of this evaluation effort. 6. Respondents to this RFP should submit the following in response to this synopsis/solicitation: a. A fact sheet and an initial bid for ten (10) Operational Control System with the attributes listed on Attachment 1 to the RFP package. (CLIN 0001) b. A bid for an additional purchase of up to 300 OCS. These may be purchased as funding becomes available in the future. Therefore, all offerors shall propose any quantity discount(s) available, and what the minimum order is to receive any quantity discount. This additional purchase will be placed as an option in the ensuing contract. (CLIN 0002) c. A bid for a cable to harvest energy from the Glenair connector on the AN/PRC-117G MicroSun battery (117G Battery) to power the kit through your power management solution. This will be placed as an option in the ensuing contract. (CLIN 0003) Additional details for the connection will be provided when the option is exercised. d. Information on system warranties. Please state what is included in the standard warranty for the system. In addition, please state if higher level warranties are available, what they entail, and the costs associated with those warranties. In the event that this office determines to purchase a higher level warranty, that warranty will be included as a separate CLIN in the contract. (CLIN 0004) e. Two (2) Operational Control Systems. (as discussed in paragraph 8 below). 7. The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition. The provision at FAR 5212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, is incorporated and the Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to that responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. As indicated on the attached Standard Form 1449, award will be made on the basis of a simplified trade-off. In this instance, technical selection criteria will be of greater importance than cost. The Government will also evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total cost for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). General statements that the offeror can or will comply with the requirements, that standard procedures will be used, or paraphrases of the RFP specification in whole or in part will not constitute compliance with this requirement concerning the content of the technical requirement. Offerors shall complete and submit with each proposal FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications &ndash; Commercial Items and DFARS 242.212-7000 Offeror Representations and Certifications &ndash; Commercial Items. 8. Two (2) paper copies should be submitted to the address listed in paragraph 10 below which should cover all the information in paragraph 6 above. Paper copies shall be clearly labeled &ldquo;Proprietary/Competition Sensitive Information&rdquo; on the cover sheets and in close proximity to this type of information, on each applicable page. Proprietary/Competition Sensitive information shall be protected from disclosure. E-mail copies of the paper submittal shall be accepted. In addition, in accordance with FAR clause 52-212.01(d), two (2) Operational Control Systems shall be delivered to the program office CONCURRENT with your paper proposal for additional evaluation. One system shall have Windows XP operating system on the computer, and the other shall have Window 7 operating system on the computer. After review is complete, the systems shall be returned to the offeror. Please include name, address, and shipping information (including vendor&rsquo;s FedEx numbers) for the return of these items. 9. First delivery of ten OCS is scheduled for 30 days after the contract is awarded. The place of delivery is listed in the model contract attached hereto. The contractor shall propose a delivery schedule for the remainder of the tactical headsets. 10. Responses and prototypes shall be received no later than 20 April 2012. Paper/e-mail submittals and prototypes shall be sent to ASC/WISK, Attn: Jarrett Stamper, 1895 Fifth Street, Bldg 46, Wright-Patterson AFB

An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1A. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: http://orca.bpn.gov/publicsearch.aspx. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, complete the following Addendum I to 52.212-3:<br /><br />52.212-3 Addendum, Certification to Accept the Government Purchase Card (GPC).

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4) The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This requirement is being issued in conjunction with FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures, as applicable. The solicitation number is 1100668. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-57 dated March 15, 2012.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is- 325413- In-Vitro Diagnostic Substance Manufacturing; Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees and is issued as full and open competition.</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) requires DNA Methylation Microarrays, Labeling and Hybridization Reagents.</p>
<p>The Center for Functional Genomics within NCTR requires rat DNA methylation microarrays and reagents for high quality and sensitive detection of DNA methylation changes to meet the research projects and protocols needs of the Center. The project is for genetic and epigenetic mechanisms for sex differences in the kidney of a rat model system: developing safety biomarkers for FDA regulated products. This study requires that data obtained by microarrays be of highest quality to determine DNA methylation changes in the kidney of a rat model over the 2 year period to assist the FDA in evaluating drug research. Various sex differences in renal disease, renal disease progression, and susceptibility to acute renal failure following surgery have been noted, including age of onset and severity. There is an urgent and unmet need for mechanistic insight to understand and address these sex differences in clinical renal injury and any potential interaction of age with sex. Understanding these differences will aid in the development of biomarkers and therapeutic interventions, as well as identify potential safety issues. Sex- and age-associated differences in gene expression patterns, as well as expression regulatory elements such as microRNA and DNA methylation, will be examined in the kidney in both sexes throughout the life cycle in the rat model system. The arrays with enzyme labeling hybridization reagents, array processing and accessories must meet the following requirements:</p>
<p>&bull; The DNA methylation microarrays must contain at least 385,000 unique probes in order to provide comprehensive coverage throughout the rat genome.<br />&bull; These DNA methylation microarrays must have high sensitivity and specificity in order to readily detect as low as two methylated CpGs in a 500 base pair (bp) fragment.<br />&bull; The DNA methylation array reagents must allow low sample input of 10 ng (nanogram) or less genomic DNA per labeling reaction without amplification bias.<br />&bull; The microarray reagents must utilize a dye source for direct labeling method and hybridization for optimal microarray performance.<br />&bull; These arrays must be compatible with the Government's existing G2505C Agilent microarray scanner and the Government's long-term experience with the glass-slide based microarray format. The slides must fit a 1"x3" glass slide format for fluorescent image scanning with barcode labels.<br />&bull; The manufacturer must provide quality kits for the conduct of these experiments and, in addition, provide detailed experimental protocols.</p>
<p>Rat DNA methylation microarrays for 90 samples with accompanying enzyme labeling and hybridization reagents and array processing accessories.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>2. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131)<br />U S COAST GUARD<br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS<br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112<br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
<p>(xiii) See additional document(s) for uploaded documents to support order requirements: N/A<br />(xiv) Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS): N/A</p>
<p>(xv) QUOTES ARE DUE BY 4:30 PM EST Wednesday March 28th, 2012; Deadline for questions will be Tuesday March 27th, 2012 @ 1:30 PM EST. Please email your quotes and questions to Iris.M.Johnson@uscg.mil.</p>

(Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the Contracting Officer; this is not an appellate review of a Contracting Officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the Contracting Officer).

Contractor may not at any time request consideration as a result of choosing to access the installation using the day pass process.  
Enrollment/Registration
Companies that service Fort McCoy may enroll in the RAPIDGate Program by calling 1-877-RAPIDGate (1-877-727-4342).  The Program will confirm with the installation that the company has legitimate business on the installation. Once the company has enrolled, its employees can register at the self-service Registration Station located at the Fort McCoy Welcome Center.
The RAPIDGate Program confirms the individual?s employment status with the company, and then performs identity authentication and background screening.  Employees who qualify are issued a personalized RAPIDGate ID Badge.  The Program performs background screening on a regular basis to verify continued eligibility in the Program.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

As used in this clause?(1) ?Contract financing payment? and ?invoice payment? have the meanings given in section 32.001 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.(2) ?Electronic form? means any automated system that transmits information electronically from the initiating system to all affected systems. Facsimile, e-mail, and scanned documents are not acceptable electronic forms for submission of payment requests. However, scanned documents are acceptable when they are part of a submission of a payment request made using Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) or another electronic form authorized by the Contracting Officer.(3) ?Payment request? means any request for contract financing payment or invoice payment submitted by the Contractor under this contract.(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this clause, the Contractor shall submit payment requests and receiving reports using WAWF, in one of the following electronic formats that WAWF accepts: Electronic Data Interchange, Secure File Transfer Protocol, or World Wide Web input. Information regarding WAWF is available on the Internet at https://wawf.eb.mil/.(c) The Contractor may submit a payment request and receiving report using other than WAWF only when?(1) The Contracting Officer authorizes use of another electronic form. With such an authorization, the Contractor and the Contracting Officer shall agree to a plan, which shall include a timeline, specifying when the Contractor will transfer to WAWF;(2) DoD is unable to receive a payment request or provide acceptance in electronic form;(3) The Contracting Officer administering the contract for payment has determined, in writing, that electronic submission would be unduly burdensome to the Contractor. In such cases, the Contractor shall include a copy of the Contracting Officer?s determination with each request for payment; or(4) DoD makes payment for commercial transportation services provided under a Government rate tender or a contract for transportation services using a DoD-approved electronic third party payment system or other exempted vendor payment/invoicing system (e.g., PowerTrack, Transportation Financial Management System, and Cargo and Billing System).(d) The Contractor shall submit any non-electronic payment requests using the method or methods specified in Section G of the contract.(e) In addition to the requirements of this clause, the Contractor shall meet the requirements of the appropriate payment clauses in this contract when submitting payment requests.<BR><BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

<DESC>** <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This Amendment 01 includes one additional question to the interested parties section of the RFI description.&nbsp; All other information&nbsp;to this Sources Sought Notice originally posted 1 Dec 2011 remains unchanged.</span> **<br /><br />THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. This RFI is issued for the purpose of developing a viable solicitation that will best communicate the Government's requirements to industry. Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary and will not affect any corporation's ability to submit an offer if and when a solicitation is released. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of the submission of contractors' information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION. The 772 Enterprise Sourcing Squadron (ESS) in conjunction with the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), Lackland Air Force Base, TX, is planning to contract with Architect-Engineer (A-E) firms to perform worldwide and regional Title I, Title II, and other A-E services to administer, coordinate, and technically support Environmental, Military Construction (MILCON), Military Family Housing (MFH), and Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization (SRM) programs of interest to the government.</p>
<p>We anticipate multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract awards and anticipate using NAICS codes 541330. The small business size standard associated with NAICS code 541330 is $4.5M. Previous 4P A-E contracts have used NAICS code 562910. The small business size standard associated with NAICS code 562910 is 500 employees. We anticipate awarding approximately 10-20 contracts to large and small businesses. We are contemplating regionalizing contracts for services for CONUS (defined as the lower 48 states, Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. territories) installations and dedicating suites of small business IDIQ contracts to each region in addition to awarding suites of worldwide contracts. The scope of A-E services (i.e. Title I/II &amp; Other) will be similar for all contracts. However the TYPE of projects/programs (i.e. MILCON, MFH, SRM) is anticipated to differ between the worldwide and regional IDIQ suites.</p>
<p>We anticipate the development of two separate Statements of Work (SOW), one for worldwide IDIQ awards and one for regional IDIQ awards. However for this RFI the attached DRAFT SOW covers all anticipated services and project/program efforts. The attached DRAFT SOW has changed substantially from the current AFCEE 4PA-E08 SOW. Sections 8.0, 13.2 and 14.0 are examples of scope areas that have been significantly revised or updated. Recommend review of entire SOW. All sub-categories of small businesses are being looked at during our market research phase. At this time, we are considering that task orders under these contracts will be negotiated as either Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), Time &amp; Materials (T&amp;M) or Firm Fixed Price (FFP) orders, depending on the nature of the requirement. Additionally, we anticipate that each contract will have a basic ordering period of five (5) years with three additional years for performance. Central Contract Registration (CCR) will be mandatory for these contracts (see CCR website at www.ccr.gov).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND AND PROGRAM INFORMATION. These IDIQ contracts will serve to functionally replace services contained within AFCEE's existing Worldwide Planning, Program, and Design (4P A-E08) contracts. The ordering period under the 4P A-E08 contracts expire during the Feb - Aug 2013 timeframe. <br />ANTICIPATED GENERAL SCOPE OF WORLDWIDE SERVICES<br />To provide Title I, Title II, and Other A-E Services for environmental and traditional MILCON, Military Family Housing (including projects related to Privatized Housing), and SRM projects. The SRM projects will be limited to locations overseas and contingency operations (as defined under 10 USC, 101 (a)(13)). The anticipated services include:</p>
<p>&bull; Title I Services: Title I services are related to a specific construction project and consist of conducting field surveys and investigations to obtain design data and preparing contract plans, specifications, and cost estimates. Title I services may include all aspects of design such as preparation and/or review of contract plans, specifications, scheduling, cost estimates, building commissioning services and preparation of operating and design manuals. Title I efforts also encompass those efforts required to support and develop design work, including planning and programming, program management, project scoping, studies, investigations, evaluations, consultations, conceptual design, value engineering, and operation, monitoring, topographic survey services, and optimization of environmental treatment or control systems<br /><br />&bull; Title II Services: Title II services are related to a specific construction project and consist of supervision and inspection of construction. Title II services may include all aspects of construction quality assurance and oversight of environmental and facility construction and renovation projects</p>
<p>&bull; Other A-E Services: These services are design and construction-related services, but are not connected with a specific construction project. The services may consist of developing design criteria, fact finding studies, surveys, investigations, and the performance of environmental projects involving prevention, compliance, and restoration when the services of registered architects or engineers are required.

<DESC><p>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. This RFI is issued for the purpose of developing a viable solicitation that will best communicate the Government's requirements to industry. Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. The requested information is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of the submission of contractors' information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL INFORMATION.</strong> The 772 Enterprise Sourcing Squadron (ESS) in conjunction with the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), Lackland Air Force Base, TX, is planning to contract with Architect-Engineer (A-E) firms to perform worldwide and regional Title I, Title II, and other A-E services to administer, coordinate, and technically support Environmental, Military Construction (MILCON), Military Family Housing (MFH), and Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization (SRM) programs of interest to the Government.</p>
<p>We anticipate multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract awards and anticipate using NAICS codes 541330 and 562910. The small business size standard associated with NAICS code 541330 is $4.5M. <strong>(NOTE: Effective 12 March 2012, the size standard will be $14.0M for NAICS code 541330.)</strong> The small business size standard associated with NAICS code 562910 is 500 employees.</p>
<p>We anticipate awarding Engineering Services (NAICS 541330) contracts to large and small businesses. In addition to awarding suites of worldwide contracts, we are contemplating regionalizing contracts for services for Continental United States (CONUS) (defined as the lower 48 states, Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. territories) installations and dedicating suites of small business IDIQ contracts to each region. The scope of A-E services (i.e. Title I/II &amp; Other A-E Services) will be similar for all contracts. The type of projects/programs for the worldwide suites will include MILCON, MFH, SRM and Contingency projects. The type of projects/programs for the regional suites will include SRM projects.</p>
<p>We anticipate awarding Environmental Remediation Services (NAICS 562910) contracts to small businesses. The scope of A-E services will include Title I/II &amp; Other A-E Services. The types of projects/programs will include Environmental Remediation, Environmental Compliance (EC), and Environmental Quality (EQ) projects. Work will be performed primarily in CONUS. There may be a small amount of OCONUS work anticipated.</p>
<p>All sub-categories of small businesses are being looked at during our market research phase. At this time, we are considering that task orders under these contracts will be negotiated as either Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) or Firm Fixed Price (FFP) orders, depending on the nature of the requirement. Additionally, we anticipate that each contract will have a basic ordering period of five (5) years with two additional years for performance. Central Contract Registration (CCR) will be mandatory for these contracts (see CCR website at <a href="http://www.ccr.gov">www.ccr.gov</a>).</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND AND PROGRAM INFORMATION.</strong> These IDIQ contracts will serve to functionally replace services contained within AFCEE's existing Worldwide Planning, Program, and Design (4P A-E08) contracts. The ordering period under the 4P A-E08 contracts expire during the Feb - Aug 2013 timeframe. <br /><br /><strong>ANTICIPATED GENERAL SCOPE OF <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ENGINEERING SERVICES</span> (NAICS 541330)<br /></strong>To provide Title I, Title II, and Other A-E Services for traditional MILCON, Military Family Housing (including projects related to Privatized Housing), and SRM requirements.

<p><strong>GENERAL INFORMATION.</strong> The 772 Enterprise Sourcing Squadron (ESS) in conjunction with the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), Lackland Air Force Base, TX, is planning to contract with Architect-Engineer (A-E) firms to perform worldwide and regional Title I, Title II, and other A-E services to administer, coordinate, and technically support Environmental, Military Construction (MILCON), Military Family Housing (MFH), and Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization (SRM) programs of interest to the Government.</p>
<p>We anticipate multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract awards and anticipate using NAICS codes 541330 and 562910. The small business size standard associated with NAICS code 541330 is $4.5M. <strong>(NOTE: Effective 12 March 2012, the size standard will be $14.0M for NAICS code 541330.)</strong> The small business size standard associated with NAICS code 562910 is 500 employees.</p>
<p>We anticipate awarding Engineering Services (NAICS 541330) contracts to large and small businesses. In addition to awarding suites of worldwide contracts, we are contemplating regionalizing contracts for services for Continental United States (CONUS) (defined as the lower 48 states, Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. territories) installations and dedicating suites of small business IDIQ contracts to each region. The scope of A-E services (i.e. Title I/II &amp; Other A-E Services) will be similar for all contracts. The type of projects/programs for the worldwide suites will include MILCON, MFH, SRM and Contingency projects. The type of projects/programs for the regional suites will include SRM projects.</p>
<p>We anticipate awarding Environmental Remediation Services (NAICS 562910) contracts to small businesses. The scope of A-E services will include Title I/II &amp; Other A-E Services.

<p>1. What are your thoughts about separating the A-E requirements into two separate contracts, Environmental Remediation (NAICS 562910) and Engineering Services (541330)?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In regard to Environmental Remediation Services (NAICS 562910) only (questions 2 &amp;3)</span></strong></p>
<p>2. Do you have any thoughts or concerns about setting aside all environmental remediation requirements to small business?</p>
<p>3. What is your business size? If you are a small business, do you also qualify under any of the sub-categories (8(a), small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, service disabled veteran-owned small business, and HBCU/MI)?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In regard to Engineering Services (NAICS 541330) only (questions 4-6)</span></strong></p>
<p>4. Do you have any thoughts or concerns about reserving all of the CONUS regional contracts for small business?</p>

<p>1. What are your thoughts about separating the A-E requirements into two separate contracts, Environmental Remediation (NAICS 562910) and Engineering Services (541330)?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In regard to Environmental Remediation Services (NAICS 562910) only (questions 2 &amp;3)</span></strong></p>
<p>2. Do you have any thoughts or concerns about setting aside all environmental remediation requirements to small business?</p>
<p>3. What is your business size? If you are a small business, do you also qualify under any of the sub-categories (8(a), small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, service disabled veteran-owned small business, and HBCU/MI)?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In regard to Engineering Services (NAICS 541330) only (questions 4-6)</span></strong></p>
<p>4. Do you have any thoughts or concerns about reserving all of the CONUS regional contracts for small business?</p>
<p>5. As previously noted, some CONUS projects may be issued against the worldwide contracts. What would your recommended project parameters include (i.e. "X" dollar value, "X" project type) to move a requirement from a regional CONUS contract to the worldwide contract?</p>
<p>6. There is a potential to establish only three regions (i.e. East, West and Central) for the CONUS Engineering Services efforts. Do you have any thoughts or concerns about your firm's capacity to cover large CONUS regions?</p>
<p>7. Do you have any other comments or suggestions that you would like to share with us?</p>
<p>Please include the following with your response: name and address of firm; size of business; point of contact and telephone number, average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees, classification standard i.e. large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, etc, affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, and potential teaming partners.</p>

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. <br /><br /><br />THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. This RFI is issued for the purpose of developing a viable solicitation that will best communicate the Government's requirements to industry. Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. The requested information is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of the submission of contractors' information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL INFORMATION.</strong> The 772 Enterprise Sourcing Squadron (ESS) in conjunction with the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), Lackland Air Force Base, TX, is planning to contract with Architect-Engineer (A-E) firms to perform worldwide and regional Title I, Title II, and other A-E services to administer, coordinate, and technically support Environmental, Military Construction (MILCON), Military Family Housing (MFH), and Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization (SRM) programs of interest to the Government.</p>
<p>We anticipate multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract awards and anticipate using NAICS codes 541330 and 562910. The small business size standard associated with NAICS code 541330 is $4.5M. <strong>(NOTE: Effective 12 March 2012, the size standard will be $14.0M for NAICS code 541330.)</strong> The small business size standard associated with NAICS code 562910 is 500 employees.</p>
<p>We anticipate awarding Engineering Services (NAICS 541330) contracts to large and small businesses. In addition to awarding suites of worldwide contracts, we are contemplating regionalizing contracts for services for Continental United States (CONUS) (defined as the lower 48 states, Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. territories) installations and dedicating suites of small business IDIQ contracts to each region. The scope of A-E services (i.e. Title I/II &amp; Other A-E Services) will be similar for all contracts. The type of projects/programs for the worldwide suites will include MILCON, MFH, SRM and Contingency projects. The type of projects/programs for the regional suites will include SRM projects.</p>
<p>We anticipate awarding Environmental Remediation Services (NAICS 562910) contracts to small businesses. The scope of A-E services will include Title I/II &amp; Other A-E Services. The types of projects/programs will include Environmental Remediation, Environmental Compliance (EC), and Environmental Quality (EQ) projects. Work will be performed primarily in CONUS. There may be a small amount of OCONUS work anticipated.</p>
<p>All sub-categories of small businesses are being looked at during our market research phase. At this time, we are considering that task orders under these contracts will be negotiated as either Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) or Firm Fixed Price (FFP) orders, depending on the nature of the requirement. Additionally, we anticipate that each contract will have a basic ordering period of five (5) years with two additional years for performance. Central Contract Registration (CCR) will be mandatory for these contracts (see CCR website at <a href="http://www.ccr.gov">www.ccr.gov</a>).</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND AND PROGRAM INFORMATION.</strong> These IDIQ contracts will serve to functionally replace services contained within AFCEE's existing Worldwide Planning, Program, and Design (4P A-E08) contracts. The ordering period under the 4P A-E08 contracts expire during the Feb - Aug 2013 timeframe. <br /><br /><strong>ANTICIPATED GENERAL SCOPE OF <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ENGINEERING SERVICES</span> (NAICS 541330)<br /></strong>To provide Title I, Title II, and Other A-E Services for traditional MILCON, Military Family Housing (including projects related to Privatized Housing), and SRM requirements. Requirements for CONUS regional suites will include SRM projects. Requirements for worldwide suites will include MILCON, MFH, SRM and Contingency projects.

A response to the confirmation request must be received no later than 3 calendar days after receipt. No additional questions will be answered in regards to the buy at that time.<BR><BR>

<DESC><br />This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract and is not a request for competitive proposals under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The government intends to solicit a quote and enter into a purchase order with Hologic Inc. , Bedford,MA<br /><br /><br /><br />JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br />Part I - Background Information and Description of the Requirement <br />I. Program Office: <br />Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences<br />NIH Clinical Center<br />Nuclear Medicine <br />10 Center Drive, Room 1C-401<br />Bethesda, MD 20892<br />301-496-5675

<p><br />II. Project Information</p>
<p>Title: New Service Maintenance Agreement for Hologic, Inc. Bone Densitometry scanner that is coming off of original equipment manufacturer warranty; new installation was 3/2011. <br /><br />POTS Requisition No. 12-007025</p>
<p>Proposed Contractor: Hologic, Inc. <br />35 Crosby Drive<br />Bedford, MA 01730<br />Karl Schmidt, Service Sales<br />610-440-0313 (home office)<br />484-951-6140 (cell)<br />610-440-2264 (fax)<br />kschmidt@hologic.com</p>
<p>III. Project Background and Description<br />The Radiology &amp; Imaging Sciences Department, Nuclear Medicine purchased a new "Discovery A" Bone Densitometry Unit from Hologic, Inc. (The Women's Health Company, aka "Hologic") in 2010, with installation occurring in March, 2011. This system is now coming off of the manufacturer's warranty and must be covered by a service maintenance agreement. This unit was purchased in order to replace two (2) aged Hologic Bone Densitometry units. <br />A sole source vendor service maintenance agreement (SMA) would support on-going research studies that have utilized similar equipment and proprietary software databases. The purchase of a new Bone Densitometry unit from Hologic ensured the seamless correlation for longitudinal research studies/protocols, as well as provided for improved and timely patient imaging. The purchase will also permitted improved data transmission between Nuclear Medicine and the Radiology Information System (RIS) and CRIS systems, thus providing improved patient care and research support. This capability is especially important when one considers the enormous amount of research data that must be converted to be usable with the new acquisition system and workstation. <br />There are few vendors for this type of equipment and so it is vital to have the original manufacturer provide the service necessary to maintain the equipment at optimal functionality. Hardware and software updates are often required to keep the equipment functionality at a state-of-art level. Some software can be proprietary to the vendor but vitally necessary to ensure that data comparisons are not compromised. <br />IV. Prior and Future Contracts<br />This vendor's service has been in use by the department for over 10 years on prior models of similar equipment. <br />Part II - Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition <br />I. Statutory Authority<br />The sole source acquisition is justified under the statutory authority contained in U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and the following authority contemplated by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2). "When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for."<br />II. Justification<br />Hologic, Inc., a Family of Companies (aka "Hologic"), proposes to offer a service maintenance agreement for the following piece of equipment, which is located within the Radiology and Imaging Sciences Department, Nuclear Medicine (NM): 1) the "Discovery A" bone densitometry unit. This piece of equipment was originally purchased through Hologic, as the original equipment manufacturer and sole service provider. <br />Hologic will provide new release operating software and upgrades to software as developed and when necessary to maintain this equipment at high operational standards, which diminishes the untimely obsolescence of imaging equipment. These software packages, physician workstation, acquisition terminal and imaging scanner equipment are in daily use by the Radiology and Imaging Sciences Department, Nuclear Medicine section. Nuclear Medicine is requesting this service maintenance agreement for the Hologic Bone Densitometry unit, on a sole source basis for the following reasons:<br />&bull; The Hologic operating and applications software, a component covered by the service maintenance agreement, have been found to work well with the current RAD&amp;IS and PACS daily workflow.<br />&bull; As a product line developed and maintained by Hologic, the operating and applications software, physician workstation, operating console and imaging scanner are only available from Hologic. Only Hologic has the rights to this copyrighted product line. Hologic is the only provider of updates, upgrades and technical support for this product line. <br />&bull; As a product developed and maintained by Hologic, only Hologic has the knowledge base and support services required to maintain this product line.<br />&bull; Hologic has proven to be a reliable service provider.</p>
<p><br /><br /><br /><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a capability statement. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the Clinical Center to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. The capability statement must be received in the CC contracting office on or before 10:00 AM EST on March 28, 2012. All questions must be submitted in writing and can be emailed to Gail Akinbinu, Contract Specialist at gakinbinu@cc.nih.gov@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov. No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference solicitation 12-007025 on all correspondence.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<DESC><p>This is a Request for Quotes.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NOAA Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Marine Mammal Laboratory is seeking a contractor to provide a charter vessel (including crew) for up to 33 days during Aug - Sep 2012.</p>
<p>The objective of the research is to conduct passive acoustic monitoring studies and oceanographic sampling to determine abundance, migratory patterns, acoustic ecology, and foraging ecology of cetaceans and their prey. In addition, biological and population studies of large whales will be continued in the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas by deploying radio and satellite transmitters on whales, conducting photo-identification, and biopsy sampling.<br />There may be 4 additional option days used to work additional areas following the main cruise.<br />The cruise will depart from and return to Dutch Harbor, AK. Sonobuoys will be deployed round the clock during the transit to acoustically monitor for the presence of whales. Also during transit to the working area one or more onshore/offshore transects (CTD and net tows) will be conducted. Once in the working area, approximately 30 moorings containing passive acoustic recorders, active acoustic instruments, and a variety of oceanographic instrumentation will be retrieved and re-deployed at predetermined locations throughout the study area. At least six onshore/offshore transects (each consisting of approximately 10 CTD/net tow stations) will be conducted in the study area. In addition, dragging along the seafloor will be conducted in an attempt to recover moorings as necessary from previous years. Additional personnel or equipment may need to be picked up and/or dropped off in Nome, Wainwright, Kotzebue, Barrow, or any other suitable transfer location near the working grounds. <br />In addition to the 29 charter days and the 4 optional charter days, two weeks of dwell time are required in Seattle WA for installation of Government Owned equipment prior to the vessel's departure for Dutch Harbor AK. An additional 2 days in Seattle WA (preferably at the NOAA Sandpoint pier) prior to the vessel's departure for Dutch Harbor AK will be required for on-loading of Government owned equipment. At the conclusion of the charter one additional day will be required for the off loading of the Government owned equipment at either Seattle WA (preferably at the NOAA Sandpoint pier) or at Dutch Harbor AK. If the offeror proposes to off load at Dutch Harbor rather than Seattle the Governments anticipates incurring shipping costs which the Government will add to the proposed price for evaluation purposes.</p>

Qualified vendors shall be capable of providing the necessary special knowledge and skills not available within the organization required of OASD(NII)/DOD CIO to support its mission.</p>
<p>The Office of the DOD Chief Information Officer (DOD CIO) requires Information Management (IM), Information Technology (IT), and Information Assurance (IA) support services. The DOD CIO drives the evolution of the Department's network &amp; information capabilities to meet its ever changing mission needs creating a seamless, secure information environment that delivers agile and secure information capabilities to enhance our Nation's combat power and decision making is critical to the accomplishment of the DOD CIO's vision. To that end, the DOD CIO requires contractor support services and expertise in areas such as command and control (C2), communications, IT infrastructure, and information assurance (IA) to ensure that these capabilities are architected, engineered, and delivered in a manner that optimizes the Department's mission capabilities, increases the Department's security posture, and makes most effective use of the Department's financial resources. The contractor shall provide expertise, personnel, equipment, software development capabilities &amp; tools, materials, supervision, other items and the non-personal services necessary to support the DOD CIO in all matters associated with IM/IT/IA. The required outcome is to support the DOD Information Technology (IT) Enterprise goals - increase mission effectiveness, improve cyber security, and deliver efficiencies. The DOD CIO declared that Information is one of our Nation's greatest sources of power. Therefore, the DOD CIO requires contractor support services that ultimately support the goal of delivering that power to enable the achievement of mission success in all operations of the Department: war fighting, business, and intelligence.</p>

<DESC>This activity supports the objectives of the NASA Airspace Systems Program (ASP)and the NextGen Concepts and Technology Development (CTD) Project.  Specifically, itsupports NextGen CTD Project Milestone Development and Evaluation of a Traffic AwareStrategic Aircrew Requests (TASAR) System. The NextGen CTD Project develops innovativeconcepts and technologies to improve the efficiency, capacity, and safety of the NationalAirspace System.  Research focus areas include traffic flow management, dynamic airspaceconfiguration, separation assurance, super density operations, and airport surfaceoperations.  In the area of separation assurance, CTD research includes the developmentof advanced concepts and technologies for aircraft to provide their own trafficseparation services, i.e. airborne separation, using Automatic Dependent SurveillanceBroadcast (ADS-B).  This far-term research activity has produced advanced algorithmsfor detecting and resolving traffic conflicts in the presence of weather and timeconstraints.  Leveraging this far-term research, NASA envisions a near-term application of the advancedflight-deck technology to improve pilot-initiated requests for trajectory change made toAir Traffic Control (ATC) in todays operations.  In a concept called Traffic AwareStrategic Aircrew Requests (TASAR), pilots would use onboard automation tools toidentify trajectory improvement opportunities and to de-conflict them from trafficaircraft prior to making the trajectory-change request to ATC. The TASAR capability isanticipated to increase ATC approval frequency and therefore to provide benefits in areassuch as flight efficiency, flight schedule compliance, passenger comfort, and pilot andcontroller workload.  With TASAR, NASA intends to help accelerate the adoption of ADS-B equipage by theaircraft operator community.  The objective of this contract is to explore theimplementation requirements for certification and operational approval of TASAR, as wellas to assess the pilot interface and procedures associated with the flight-decktechnology.  By analyzing the implementation requirements and assessing pilot use of theTASAR capability in simulation, the path to possible implementation for operational usecan be shortened.This contract results from a proposal submitted by Rockwell Collins, Inc., for award ofTask 2 and Task 4 under the NASA Headquarters Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate(ARMD) NASA Research Announcement (NRA) entitled Research Opportunities in Aeronautics 2010, Amendment 7, NextGen CTD Project, Subtopic 5.  The focus of this effort is to explore the certification and operational approvalrequirements for a deployable TASAR system and to assess TASAR use by pilots andcontrollers.  Tasks are defined to achieve the following objectives: 1.      Productionof an implementation assessment to enable near term deployment and use of TASAR inregular service as a flight deck application.  (Solicitation Task 2) and 2. Design andexecution of a simulation plan resulting in pilot assessments of the technical functionsand the Human Machine Interface (HMI) designs of the TASAR Application.  (SolicitationTask 4).

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1
<AWDNBR>FA2543-12-R-0008
<AWDDATE>033012
<DESC><p>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL (J&amp;A) <br />FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p><br />I. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY</p>
<p>The 460th Contracting Squadron (CONS) at Buckley Air Force Base (BAFB), Colorado, intends to issue a two (2) month bridge purchase order for the 460th Civil Engineering Squadron (460 CES) to continue uninterrupted Refuse Collection Services under the current Contract No. FA2543-07-C-0002 that expires on 31 March 12. This is a Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) to document award of the contract under Other Than Full and Open Competition due to only one responsible source being able to provide the necessary services in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING PROCESSED</p>
<p>This action is for award of a two (2) month bridge purchase order to continue Refuse Collection Services. Currently the service is performed by Republic Services, Incorporated /Allied Waste Industries, Incorporated, 5075 East 74th Avenue, Commerce City, CO 80022-1536. The period of performance for the purchase order will be from 01 April 12 through 31 May 12 for the work described within this Justification and Approval.</p>
<p>III. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY NEEDS</p>
<p>The 460 CES/CEOSS has the mission of providing Refuse Collection Services for Buckley AFB, Colorado. The estimated cost for this two (2) month bridge purchase order is $23,350. The Independent Government Estimate (IGE) is $23,350. This amount is based on the contractor's negotiated pricing from the current 6-month extension of services.</p>
<p>IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITON</p>
<p>The decision to award this contract under Other Than Full and Open Competition IAW FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A), is based upon only one responsible source and no other supplies or services available to satisfy agency requirements cited in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). These follow-on services may be deemed to be available only from the original source (current contractor). If this requirement was competed there would be substantial un-recoverable duplication of cost to the Government. The Government would also anticipate unacceptable delays of service if another contractor would take over this requirement with such a short turn-around time to initiate these services.</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATION OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE( APPLICABILITY OR AUTHORITY)</p>
<p>The Government conducted market research, details of which are in the market research section of this document. FAR Part 5.202 (13) (i) applies to this procurement action.<br />The nature of this acquisition requires that only one source can provide these services based on the following circumstances. When the current contract came to an end, a new acquisition for these services were required to be solicited under the Air Force template which mandates a combination of refuse and recycling services to a single contract. The new template standardizes the level of service throughout the United States Air Force. Evaluation of offers received for the new combined service has resulted in the filing of a Protest with the Small Business Administration; therefore, it is anticipated a new Integrated Solid Waste Management contract will be awarded at the end of the two (2) month period. Since the resolution to the CO Protest may take SBA up to 30 days or more, it is imperative that refuse collection services not be interrupted during the resolution period. The current contractor can provide the continuity of operations and delivery of refuse collection services until the new acquisition is in place.</p>
<p>The current service for Refuse Collection Service is due to expire on 31 March 2012. Awarding to a new contractor would not be cost effective for the Government based on the two (2) week turn-around time to award this purchase order and the two (2) month duration of the new purchase order. In turn, to process a full solicitation package would also create unnecessary cost for the Government.</p>
<p>Based on the two (2) week turn-around-time prior to the end of the current contract and the two (2) month duration of the new purchase order, awarding to a new contractor would not be cost effective for the Government. In turn, to process a full solicitation package would also create unnecessary cost for the Government.</p>
<p>Due to the criticality of services provided by the current contractor and the impact that would result from an interruption of services, the 460th Space Wing mission would be seriously jeopardized unless the agency is permitted to award a bridge purchase order for a period of two (2) months. The transition of a new contractor may take up to 30-60 days as a new contractor would have to setup and process security badges for employees, possibly lease or buy additional equipment, as well as hire personnel to perform the contract. These delays along with transitioning into full performance would impair the Space Wing's mission.</p>
<p>The Refuse Collection Services currently being provided are vital to the mission performed on Buckley AFB. Any interruption of these services could jeopardize the mission of the Government.</p>
<p>VI. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICTED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE</p>
<p>A Notice of Intent to issue a sole source bridge purchase order in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 for a performance period of two (2) months will be publicized on FedBizOpps at the same time of the posting of this J&amp;A. The J&amp;A will be posted once it has been approved and signed by the Contracting Officer and the technical representative. Given the costs associated for the startup and time associated with this requirement and training of personnel, ordering of equipment, the completion and award of a competitive purchase order is not realistic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VII. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL Be FAIR AND REASONABLE</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer anticipates the price for this bridge purchase order to be fair and reasonable in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(ii). The Contracting Officer (CO) will make the determination based on, but not limited to, prior contract history of like services, prevailing labor rates and adjustments, along with technical personnel. The proposed purchase order will reflect the like terms of the existing Refuse Collection contract. Therefore, current pricing (option period five) for this contract will be used for the 2-month bridge plus any additional wage determination increases. The pricing for this extension is fair and reasonable when compared to similar commercial services. Awarding a 2-month purchase order will result in lower costs than soliciting a new purchase order (re-acquisition) to acquire these services for the same length of time.</p>
<p>VIII. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS, OR A STATMENT OF THE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED</p>
<p>Market research, in accordance with FAR Part 10 was conducted by soliciting and reviewing historic pricing data, rates from the present contractor's current option period, local companies with like-services, and other local Air Force entities with similar requirements. The following local companies were contacted; Waste Connections of Colorado; Alpine Waste and Recycling and; Waste Management. Waste Connections of Colorado did not respond with current pricing, although historic information showed that their pricing is higher than the current contractor's refuse collection pricing. Alpine Waste and Recycling did not respond with pricing. Waste Management would not provide pricing for market research. Peterson AFB was also contacted to inquire on their current pricing for refuse services. The rates Peterson AFB is currently paying for refuse services is comparable but higher than the current contractor's rates.<br /><br />IX. FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>Full and open competition has been deemed unnecessary based on the contractor's knowledge of these services, combined with the urgency of this requirement, and the temporary nature of the bridge purchase order. This bridge purchase order will serve as a follow-on acquisition as described in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). The Independent Government Estimate (IGE) of $23,350 would be duplicated if this requirement was procured as a Full and Open Competition. The IGE was derived by obtained market research identified in paragraph VII of this document. Overall, the proposed bridge purchase order would ensure continuation of mission essential services. The incumbent contractor (Republic Services, Incorporated /Allied Waste Industries, Incorporated), holds all required certifications and clearances; is familiar with the requirement and is fully capable of continuing to perform for the additional two (2) months of services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>X. A LISTING OF ANY SOURCES THAT EXPRESSED THEIR INTEREST IN WRITING<br />NEIE Medical Waste Services, LLC teaming w/Republic Services, Incorporated /Allied Waste Industries, Incorporated<br /><br />Sea Coast Disposal, Incorporated</p>
<p>Hamilton Alliance</p>
<p>XI. A STATEMENT OF ACTIONS THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO FUTURE COMPETITION</p>
<p>The previous acquisition was solicited as a competitive small business set-aside. As stated within paragraph III of this document the reacquisition of this requirement was solicited as small business set-aside. <br />XII. CONTRACTING OFFICERS CERTIFICATION</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 6.303-2(b)(12) The Contracting Officer's signature on the Coordination and Approval Document is evidence he has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of his knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>As evidenced by their signature on the Coordination and Approval Document, the technical and/or requirements personnel have certified that any supporting data contained herein, which is their responsibility, is both accurate and complete.<br /><br />COORDINATION AND APPROVAL DOCUMENT</p>
<p>CONTRACTING ACTIVITY: 460th Contracting Squadron (460 CONS)<br />PROGRAM/PROJECT: Two (2) Month Refuse Collection Services Bridge Purchase Order (PO) for, Buckley AFB, Colorado<br />AUTHORITY: 10 USC 2304(c) (1) - FAR 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible Source <br />ESTIMATED COST: This action will be a purchase order in the amount of $11,675.00 per month for a 2-month period with a grand total of $23,350.00. <br />TYPE J&amp;A: Individual</p>

<DESC>FEMA tasked HNC Deployment and Housing PRT to prepare and provide infrastructure upgrades to an existing commercial mobile home park to install FEMA Temporary Housing Units (THUs) at the Country Terrace & Stony Brook Expansion Mobile Home Park in Columbia County, Pennsylvania. The contract provided forty-one mobile home sites for the placement of FEMA trailers for displaced flood victims.  <br><br>The agency's need for this contract was considered unusual and compelling because it provided for immediate  response to the safety, security, health and welfare of displaced flood victims in Columbia County, PA as directed under Presidential Disaster Declaration DR-4030, dated 12 September 2011. Due, to the fact that numerous families were homeless in the Columbia County, Pennsylvania, USACE and FEMA worked together as first responders to assist displaced flood victims.  The subject matter expertise provided by USACE HNC PRT's scope of work provided electricity, water and sewage capacity as well as site preparation so FEMA could safely and immediately install Temporary Housing Units (THUs) at Country Terrace & Stony Brook Expansion site.   FEMA rated this acquisition "High Priority" due to extensive flooding from Tropical Storm Lee and Hurricane Irene. Due to the sense of urgency, a partial Notice to Proceed (NTP) sent out by the contracting officer to the contractor on 07 November 2011.<br><br>The Government solicited Popple Construction because they were a local vendor and working a similar FEMA project within a neighboring Pennsylvania county.

<DESC>A low cost, rapidly fielded radar analysis tool that will be used by NORAD to predict changes in radar performance when proposed development projects (such as wind turbines, buildings, towers, etc) lie within a radar&rsquo;s operational line-of-sight (LOS). ROEMS shall use best available data to accurately model a range of air defense and air traffic control (ATC) radar systems. ROEMS shall also use best available data to accurately model an array of potential development obstructions, including, but not limited to: wind turbines, buildings, towers and antennae. ROEMS shall be able to output scientific radar performance measures and be able to interface seamlessly with several NORAD graphical visualization tools (Systems Tool Kit (STK) v9.2 or later, NORAD&rsquo;S Advanced Visualization Tool (AVT), the US Navy&rsquo;s Mission Compatibility Analysis Tool (MCAT), and Google Earth (Enterprise Edition)). ROEMS will use commercial off-the-shelf open-source data tool sets and existing visualization environments to the maximum extent practical. ROEMS will be a government-owned information system in order to collaborate with other federal departments in obstruction evaluations.
