<CONTACT>Beverly C. Sechrest Contracting Officer 3032313935     bev.c.sechrest@mms.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), Minerals Revenue Management (MRM), Lakewood, Colorado intends to hold an Industry Day to discuss the requirements for contract re-competition of operations and support for the financial management system. The NAICS code is 541513, Computer Facilities Management Services, Size Standard is $23 Million. Industry Day is scheduled for May 2, 2006, 9:00 a.m. to noon at the Sheraton Denver West Hotel.  Reservations are required to attend.  Please see bottom of synopsis for reservation/address/contact information.      The MRM is responsible for ensuring all revenues from federal and producing Indian mineral leases are accurately collected and disbursed to appropriate recipients in a timely manner.  To accomplish this, MRM employs a sophisticated computer system, the MRM Support System (MRMSS).      The primary production site for the MRMSS is physically housed in a contractor-owned private facility in Annapolis, MD.  The disaster recovery system is physically housed in a contractor-owned private facility in Wood Dale, IL.        The MRMSS is comprised of several different sub-systems.  These subsystems and their purpose are: 1)	Minerals Revenue Management Financial System (MFS)    The PeopleSoft based MFS contains federal onshore and offshore and producing Indian mineral lease and agreement data for use in processing mineral production and revenue reports and payments.  The data includes: ---Anniversary date and lease term, lease status - producing, non-producing, suspended, etc. ---Billing ---Accounts Receivable ---Standard General Ledger ---Accounts Payable ---Lease/well production ---Distribution Data - county, state, fund codes ---Agreement allocation schedules      The MFS also contains date related to MRM customer's mineral production and revenue reports, their mineral payments, and the disbursement of the payments to designated Indian, Federal and State recipients.      2)	Minerals Revenue Management Data Warehouse (MRMDW)    The MRMDW is a repository of historical financial and production information accessed, by internal users, other Federal agencies, industry, and the States and Tribes.  Industry accesses data confirming how reported production and royalty lines were accepted into the system.  State and tribal revenue officials access reports on revenues received and disbursed.  The Compliance Asset Management Program extends the MRMDW with tools aimed at ensuring MRM is paid all revenues owed.        3)	Royalty In Kind (RIK) System    The RIK office performs a suite of business activities involved with the sale or exchange of the government's royalty share of production taken "in kind" from Federal leases.  The RIK system is used for RIK activities involving RIK property selection, marketing, delivery nomination, credit analysis, invoicing, volume imbalance resolution, and MRM financial system interfacing.      INDUSTRY DAY will comprise of a brief introduction of the MRMSS with a question and answer of the Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS)/Solicitation which will be posted to www.fbo.gov on or about 4/11/06/.

<DESC>The goal of the electronics program is to develop and transition affordable, high  performance Radio Frequency (RF) electronics that will provide a decisive edge to the warfighter.
The program encompasses RF research, design, modeling, fabrication, and testing of  devices, integrated circuits, and multi-chip assemblies that span digital, analog, microwave and millimeter wave technologies. Toward that end the Electronics Science and Technology Program invests in science and technology initiatives that will provide the present Navy, the Next Navy, and Navy After Next with electronics technology to meet these needs.  

The ONR Science and Technology Program is divided into three parts - Discovery and Invention (D&I), Exploitation and Deployment (E&D),  and Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP).  The goals of the D&I program are to develop technologies that are applicable to the more far-term needs of the operational forces.  Efforts within the E&D Program focus primarily on the Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs) that have been selected by the Navy and Marine Corps leadership.  The focus of the E&D Program is technology development to satisfy the more near-to-midterm needs of the operational forces.  Efforts within the INP Program focus on near-term but high risk development of prototypes that could be fielded rapidly to provide significant advantages to the warfighter.  

The applications areas that provide the strongest pull for the Electronics Program are Electronic Warfare, Surveillance, and Communications Technologies.  Within Surveillance the primary thrusts are Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance, Element-Level Digital Array Radar and Non-Cooperative Target Recognition.  Within Electronic Warfare the primary thrusts are Situational Awareness, Threat Detection, and Threat ID, Counter Targeting, Self Protection, and Support Jamming, and Network Centric EW/Mission Support. Within  Communications the primary thrusts are Spectral and Energy Efficient Communications, Tactical Communications, and Dynamic Ad-hoc Wireless Networks and Internetworking.  The electronics needs of these programs are included in the information provided below.

The Health Advisor (Azerbaijan) will serve as the lead for all health and projects and activities under USAID/Caucasus, Azerbaijan and as the leader of the Health Strategtic Objective team. He/she is directly responsible for the design, management and evaluation of health activities in Azerbaijan

Azerbaijan’s health care sector faces tremendous challenges. Being one of the lowest funded in the former Soviet Union, medical facilities are poorly maintained and medical professionals do not receive updated training and knowledge. In addition, the current policy environment and inefficient public funding system hinder the country’s ability to provide accessible quality care. As a result, the cost of health care has increased while the quality of care has decreased. The health of Azerbaijani citizens has declined dramatically since independence in 1991. The leading causes of death in children are acute lower respiratory infections, diarrhea, and neonatal conditions. Only 12% of couples use modern family planning methods, and abortion remains the major fertility control method. The health of adults has suffered and life expectancy has decreased. The leading causes of mortality among adults in Azerbaijan are cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes, and injuries, and these are increasing. These health issues have an important impact on economic growth and the future productivity of the workforce, as well as on the increased burden of health care financing.

To address these challenges in Azerbaijan, USAID has made the health sector one of the Missions’s three strategic objectives and introduced health projects aim to improve health services and practices through health care reform; better use of health resources; dissemination of information on healthy lifestyles, rights and responsibilities of the patient, and health care services. USAID works closely with the government and other international donors to ensure systematic, institutionalized changes, with a focus on reproductive health/family planning, primary health care, child survival, emergency medicine, and health system strengthening.

The Health Advisor will serve as the Strategic Team leader for all health projects and activities under USAID/Caucasus, Azerbaijan. The Advisor will provide leadership for the design, implementation and evaluation of health activities and advise the Country Coordinator in Azerbaijan and the Mission Director in Tbilisi, Georgia in all aspects of the health portfolio. This position reports to the Country Coordinator and will also be responsible for providing training and mentoring to team members. The Health Advisor will supervise three local staff and work closely with the Health Fellow.


In particular the incumbent will be responsible for the following:

<DESC>The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), intends to award a sole source contract,  cost plus fixed fee contract to Zeta-Tech Associates, Inc. of Cherry Hill, NJ pursuant to the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.3 (48 CFR 6.3) NJ, to assist the FRA in monitoring the performance and assessing the benefits of two modified-alignment No. 20 rail turnouts which could allow a 10-mph speed increase through the diverging route.  These turnouts are installed in one of New Jersey Transit's main tracks, and hundreds of trains operate over them each week.  This is a follow-on effort to a previous FRA-funded project performed by Zeta-Tech Associates, Inc.. The work will require that in-service data on turnout wear and performance be collected and analyzed at regular intervals without time gaps.  The Contractor will apply previously developed design and demonstrated methods to monitor turnout component wear, collect and assess ride quality data through a turnout, and assess the potential operating benefits of a 10 mph speed increase through a turnout diverging route. The period of performance shall be two years from the award date, with an optional third year of monitoring.    The project requires measurements of the wear sustained by the subject turnouts at regular intervals. This is a non-competitive acquisition and no solicitation is available.   Interested sources must submit a fully descriptive statement of qualifications by 2:00 pm, Tuesday, April 19, 2006.  Qualification statements and resumes may be sent to the above adress, or via fax to (202)493 6171, or via email to natalie.burgess@fra.dot.gov.

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Notice 
Broad Agency Announcement VS-06-04
Air Force Research Laboratory
Space Vehicles Directorate

The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Space Vehicles Directorate (VS), Kirtland AFB, NM is interested in receiving proposals from all offerors to advance the state-of-the-art and scientific knowledge in space and missile technology; specifically, in the Risk Reduction for the Alternative Infrared Satellite System (RR-AIRSS): The Alternative Infrared Satellite System (AIRSS) program is being managed by the Developmental Planning Directorate of the Air Force Space and Missile Command (SMC/XR).  AIRSS is a parallel program to the Space Based Infrared Satellite (SBIRS) High geosynchronous satellite number 3 (GEO 3).  The decision to produce GEO 3 or AIRSS will be dependent on developmental success of the geosynchronous satellites, and the technical maturity demonstrated by AIRSS.  The decision is expected to be made in FY08.

To help support the FY08 decision gate, the Air Force Research Laboratory Space Vehicles Directorate (AFRL/VS) is executing Risk Reduction for the Alternative Infrared Satellite System (RR-AIRSS) under SMC/XR support.  The overarching goal of RR-AIRSS is to raise the maturity of the critical technologies through component and system-level performance test, environmental test and flight qualification.  The goal of RR-AIRSS is to produce the quantitative data needed to define a highly-reliable AIRSS Program Baseline for Functional Design, Budget, and Schedule and enable a low-risk on-ramp into SBIRS if needed.  The RR-AIRSS is soliciting proposals in 2 general areas: 

Topic 1.  Integrated AIRSS Payload Experiments:  Candidate infrared (IR) payloads will be assembled from components with high Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) and seek quantitative systems-level verification through ground performance and environmental test.  The integrated payloads will be tested for performance comparison to SBIRS and DSP-like requirements.   The integrated payloads will be fully flight-qualified through environmental testing focused on vibration, shock, thermal-vacuum, and electromagnetic interference (EMI).  This approach is designed to offer the most iron-clad risk reduction for AIRSS, as opposed to striving for the greatest possible payload performance.

Topic 2.  Critical AIRSS Component Development:  Design work under Topic 1 is expected to identify key areas where technology development at the component level will have major impact on the systems-level performance of the integrated payload.  Topic 2 will solicit proposals at the component level for technology development and component-level flight qualification.  Component level elements of primary interest include, but are not limited to, large area focal plane arrays, cryocoolers, advanced data processing hardware and algorithms, and wide-field-of-view (WFOV) telescopes.  The goal of efforts funded under Topic 2 will be to provide quantitative data or demonstrated capability needed to include the component in an integrated payload.  Where applicable, components should be environmentally tested for suitability in a flight system.

This effort may require access to and processing of classified information up to and including SECRET/NOFORN.  Specific security guidance can be addressed to the Security Point of Contact listed below. This acquisition involves data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. A foreign disclosure review of the technical data has been accomplished and RR-AIRSS technical data are subject to export controls. All prospective offerors shall have appropriate clearances to participate in this acquisition.  The availability and commitment of adequately cleared personnel, required facilities, automated information system (AIS) and communications to support the effort in a timely and acceptable manner at the appropriate level of classification is required.

<CONTACT>Harrison Smith, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-254-2314, Email harrison.smith@dhs.gov
<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been tasked to ensure that the United States remains safe from attack by the illicit importation, development, or procurement of a nuclear or radiological device.     In recognition of the catastrophic risk posed by the use of a nuclear weapon within the United States, DHS has integrated all nuclear detection research, development, testing, evaluation, acquisition, and operational support into a single office: the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, (DNDO).  The DNDO will develop the global nuclear detection architecture; conduct research and development; and acquire and support the deployment of the domestic nuclear detection system.
The DNDO established the Office of Transformational Research and Development (OTR&D) to conduct, support, coordinate, and encourage an aggressive transformational program of Research and Development (R&D) that will dramatically improve national capabilities to detect and report attempts to import or transport a nuclear device, Special Nuclear Material (SNM), or radiological materials intended for illicit use.

Towards this end, OTR&D is conducting an aggressive program of research and development to make significant advances in basic detection technology and to reduce the cost and manpower required to fulfill DNDO objectives.  Priority is placed on R&D that has the greatest potential for filling the capability gaps in the global nuclear detection architecture.  The OTR&D will undertake those efforts that dramatically improve system performance and reduce technical, performance, and/or cost risks in achieving DNDO objectives.  The Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) is the final stage of performance testing and evaluation before transitioning to commercial system development.
The DNDO is soliciting proposals under this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for an ATD of Intelligent Personal Radiation Locators (IPRLs) that can lead to a dramatic improvement in national capabilities in nuclear/radiological detection and verification.  The Government encourages participation from private industry, academic institutions, National/Government laboratories, Federally Funded Research & Development Centers (FFRDCs), and non-profit organizations.  The submission deadline for full technical and cost proposals is May 16, 2006.

<DESC>The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is seeking information from industry relating to technologies and approaches for the automated conversion (to the highest degree practical) of BLS statistical information, represented in XML, to Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF). This notice is a Request for Information (RFI) from interested vendors who believe they are able to satisfy the requirements detailed in the description below.  BLS does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for information received in response to this request.  This RFI is being issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  The information contained in this RFI is based on the best and most current information available to date, is subject to change, and is not binding on the Government.  Below is background information and description of the requirements for the XML to PDF conversion.

Background
The BLS is the principal fact-finding agency for the Federal Government in the broad field of labor economics and statistics. The BLS is an independent national statistical agency that collects, processes, analyzes, and disseminates essential statistical data to the American public, the U.S. Congress, other Federal agencies, State and local governments, business, and labor. 

The BLS provides its data to the public in a variety of formats including digital formats (such as web pages on the Internet, e.g.  http://stats.bls.gov)  and printed formats (e.g. http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf ).  

BLS data, either in print or electronic form, is often presented as tables of statistical data.  Formatting statistical data tables for print is more difficult than formatting them for presentation in, for example, HTML because printed output is constrained by the fixed size of a standard printed page. Currently, BLS requires substantial manual manipulation of tabular data for printed output to ensure that tables, and to a lesser degree, text and graphics are displayed in a sensible and readable fashion.   (See Requirements and Constraints section below for more detail on issues related to displaying statistical tables in print).

Currently, BLS extracts tabular data from a database in the form of an XML dataset, which is transformed into XHTML for display on the Bureau’s web site.  This RFI is for investigation of the feasibility of transforming the XML dataset into PDF for use as a camera-ready output.  The transformation should be accomplished with a minimum of manual intervention.  


Requirements and Constraints
•	The goal is to convert XML data sets to camera ready PDF files for printed distribution.
•	The source XML datasets specify content and structure.  As such they do not, and should not, contain presentation information. 
•	Style sheets containing presentation information do not currently exist.
•	The desired solution will be as highly automated, and will require as little manual intervention, as possible.
•	It is highly desirable that the solution be implemented in Java in order to make it more compatible with the current environment.
•	The camera ready copy (PDF) will be in black and white and contain statistical tables of varying length, text, graphics, header and footer information, footnotes and may contain multiple fonts.
•	The layout of the statistical tables must support multiple levels of nested column headings, spanned across columns, and multiple levels of nested row headings, indicated through indentation.
•	Statistical tables will vary in length, and some will extend over multiple pages. Long tables will need to be broken across page boundaries at appropriate places, with the position of page breaks to be automatically determined by the software.  Column header information and footnotes should be repeated on new pages when tables span multiple pages.   
•	Statistical tables will have a varying number of columns. The default size of each column must be automatically determined by its contents, with the possibility of design-time overrides of the defaults.
•	Columns containing numeric data must be wide enough to display the data and associated footnotes on one line (subject to the constraints of page width.)
•	Columns and headers containing text should be hyphenated as needed to fit within the boundaries of the cell. 
•	Table layouts must support decimal-point alignment when specified for a particular column.


Hardware Platform and operating system Requirements
We seek a solution using Java that can easily be integrated into our current Java/Solaris environment.  Other approaches will be considered if an acceptable Java and Solaris solution can not be identified.   

Other Requirements
The vendors must provide a statement of how the applicable Federal 508 requirements are addressed.

The solution must be capable of running in an IPv6 environment, or documented plans must exist for a timetable for implementation of any necessary enhancements required for proper functionality in an IPv6 environment.

All software (and hardware if applicable) will be evaluated in a simulated BLS computing environment to determine that the solution meets the functional and system requirements set forth in this document as well as BLS security, networking, and usage guidelines applicable to software and hardware permitted to run in the BLS computing environment.   

Respondents are requested to offer comments regarding the requirements as stated above, level of detail, completeness, consistency with industry best practices, suitability for achieving stated objectives, any areas that have been left out and should be considered, potential cost of the system and whether or not the items are available for purchase off the GSA schedule.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME.  BLS reserves the right to conduct oral capabilities demonstrations/discussions that may be scheduled at a later date.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service is issuing a Request for Proposals on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security, for an enterprise recruitment/hiring solution that can consolidate and modernize its current and/or future hiring systems, seamlessly integrate with other DHS services and non-DHS services (e.g., OPM¡¦s USAJobs and NFC¡¦s EmpowHR personnel system), and provide sufficient functionality and flexibility to meet the needs of all component organizations.  DHS will consider using systems based on commercial or government off-the-shelf software but will not adopt any solution that involves a traditional software development effort.  The DHS employee population is approximately 180,000 persons; application inflow to DHS exceeds 2 million resumes/applications annually.  In 2004, DHS filled over 28,000 positions.  DHS wishes to find, acquire and implement an enterprise solution that will automate the processes and business requirements including but  not limited to Workforce Planning, Requisitioning, Candidate Acquisition, Applicant Tracking, and Reporting/Analytics.  Additional key high level goals for this system are:  Automate the processes used to manage the full recruitment/hiring lifecycle; create a single portal for all job applicants; reduce manual processes and/or eliminate paper-based systems; provide an easy-to-use interface for all system users (hiring managers, HR and EEO professionals; and applicantsƒ{internal and external); implement industry best practices; and reduce hiring/recruitment costs.  Specific quantities and units of issue, delivery schedule, and destination information can be located within the solicitation document attached herein.  This requirement is being solicited under full and open competition.  It is anticipated that a single Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract will result from this solicitation, to include both firm-fixed price and labor hour Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs).  Contractor teaming arrangements are an acceptable solution to meet the requirements.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 511210.  The small business size standard for this NAICS code is $23 million in average annual receipts for the previous three years.  This acquisition will be conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items) and Part 15 (Contracting by Negotiation).  It is the Government¡¦s intent to award on initial proposals.  Offerors must submit a written proposal in response to the solicitation.  The duration of the contract is a one-year base period with four one-year option periods.  Potential offerors will have until April 13, 2006, to submit questions or comments regarding the solicitation.  These will be consolidated and a response will be posted on FedBizOpps approximately April 19, 2006.  Place of Performance:  The majority of the work will be performed in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.  There may be occasions requiring performance outside of this area.     The anticipated award date is July 13, 2006.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>THIS IS THE 8(a) BOA SYNOPSIS.
(THE 8(a) BOA SOLICITATION WILL BE LOADED IN FED BIZ OPPS AT THIS SAME TIME.)



SOURCES SOUGHT: Restricted to eligible 8(a) program participants serviced by the SBA San Francisco, Fresno, Sacramento, Los Angeles, Santa Ana, and San Diego District Offices, and SBA Seattle and Portland District Offices, and other 8(a) construction firms with a bona-fide places of business located in the specified geographical area in which the work is to be performed.  No solicitation will be available.  The draft BOA and the BOA submittal requirements are posted on FED BIZ OPPS in conjunction with this announcement.  The United States Coast Guard Civil Engineering Unit Oakland is seeking Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) firms serviced by SBA District Offices in Washington, Oregon, and California, and other 8(a) participants with bona-fide places of business in Washington, Oregon, and California to participate in a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) Pilot Program.  BOAs are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the U.S. Small Business Administration.  The BOA is not a contract but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the US Coast Guard, Civil Engineering Unit (CEU) Oakland, and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of construction services, if and when ordered. The BOA contains contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions, which will apply to all task orders issued under the BOA according to the dollar amount of each task order.  Annually, CEU Oakland will review the continued need for the BOA in light of (a) usefulness and need for service and (b) the effectiveness of individual contractors.  The Contracting Officer will open/advertise the BOA program for new entrants twice a year.  Under the BOA 8(a) firms compete on task orders for construction and construction related service requirements pursuant to the BOA.  General contractors are preferred, but specialty contractors will be considered as well.  Individual projects will be solicited and awarded if and when required. CEU Oakland gives no assurance from the BOA of a steady stream of work. Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by the Coast Guard to place future contracts or orders with the Contractor or to require that the Coast Guard solicit and acquire covered services from that contractor only. The anticipated construction work may require a diversity of skills suitable to a variety of tasks. The anticipated construction work to be covered under the BOAs include, but is not limited to, new construction, minor construction projects (exterior and interior renovations, alterations, repairs (emergency and routine)), handling of hazardous waste and material, maintenance, mechanical, electrical, heating/air conditioning, painting, paving, earthwork, demolition, installing pipelines, and design assistance (on-site design solution for emergency calls only).   Construction projects covered under the BOA are for work performed in the NAICS Subsector Codes 236 (formerly 233), 237 (formerly 234), and 238 (formerly 235).  GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF COVERAGE: The BOA covers Coast Guard and government installations in Washington, Oregon, and California.  PERFORMANCE PERIOD:  The performance period for the BOA is three (3) years with the Government reserving the right to grant extensions for up to two (2) additional years with no single extension exceeding one year OR until the firm graduates from the 8(a) program, whichever occurs first.  Options will not be exercised for firms that do not continue to meet all BOA requirements and will be removed accordingly.  The Agreement can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder. Either party may cancel the agreement with 60 days written notice to the other party. Any cancellation will not have any effect on task orders issued prior to the effective date of cancellation. SOLICITATIONS: Each project solicitation will indicate the detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror, and evaluation criteria and the basis for award to be used for each project.  The Contracting Officer, when awarding on a best value basis, may consider factors such as Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Management Approach and Price.  If the award basis will be on price alone, the Contractor may be required to furnish a Bid Bond with each proposal over $25,000.  CEU Oakland will require Performance and Payment Bonds on each Task order over $25,000. The Government reserves the right to obtain a more detailed cost breakdown of labor, materials, equipment, overhead and profit at any time. ORDERS: Individual projects will be awarded using the Optional Form 347 and will provide appropriate descriptions, specifications, administrative requirements, pricing terms and completion time. Each order will be considered a separate binding contract. LIMITATION OF ORDERS: The range will be from $2,000 to a maximum of $3,000,000.  Firms must demonstrate they meet the qualifications to receive a BOA.  Upon submission of the following information, the Government will review the documents and the firm will be determined to be either Eligible or Ineligible.

<DESC>NASA/DFRC intends to extend contract NAS4-01029, Facilities Maintenance, Janitorial and Grounds Maintenance, and Minor Construction Services, for six (6) months.  The incumbent contractor, DTI and Associates, Inc. currently provides maintenance, modification, landscaping, and support services for approximately 910,000 square feet of structural floor space.  Facilities and infrastructure include office buildings, mobile/modular offices and labs, warehouses, aircraft hangars, computer rooms, industrial shops, laboratories, cafeteria, roads, parking lots, aircraft taxiways, aircraft staging areas, fences and storage containers.  Associated equipment and utilities include water, irrigation systems, sewer, electric, diesel-electric generators, heating, ventilating, air conditioning, natural gas, compressed air, fire alarm, hydrazine alarm and storm damage control. NASA/DFRC intends to procure these services from DTI and Associates, Inc. of Arlington, Virginia.  The authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1 “Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements”.  A separate competitive follow-on procurement is being conducted at this time, however, it will not be completed in time to prevent a lapse in service.  A lapse in the services provided by this contract would prevent DFRC from completing its mission.  The incumbent is in possession of the requisite knowledge, skills, and experience required, which will ensure continuous services during the interim extension period.  Award to any other source would result in failure to meet the Agency's requirements. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. See note 22. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is considering issuing a contract to develop a course of intensive training in clinical trial methodology for neurology research.   NINDS is attempting to identify sources with experience and expertise to develop and coordinate the scientific design and implementation of such training.  

The field of neurology clinical trials is still fairly young; unlike in oncology and other disciplines, there is no highly developed standard for clinical trial methodology, especially with respect to pilot or early phase trials. Good design and conduct of clinical trials can provide the necessary knowledge for the generation of definitive answers about the effectiveness of new therapeutic approaches.  In contrast, poorly designed or administered trials may provide misleading results, subject patients to unnecessary risk, waste considerable resources, and potentially diminish the interest of the research community and the public in the clinical trials enterprise.   The need for more medically-trained researchers with appropriate methodological training has been identified as an important limiting factor in the scope and quality of clinical research overall and specifically in neurology.

The purpose of the “Clinical Trial Methods in Neurology” course is to increase the reliability and effectiveness of clinical trials by: introducing clinical fellows and junior faculty in any neurology or neurosurgical subspecialty to the principles of good clinical trial design; exposing early career clinical scientists to the full spectrum of challenges in clinical research; and developing a cadre of well-trained, experienced clinical researchers whose expertise will foster better clinical trials design and thereby hasten the introduction of improved regimens for therapy and prevention of neurological disorders into everyday medical practice and patient care.

It is anticipated that this annual course will yield a group of talented, dedicated neurology researchers who will consequently be in a position to obtain funding for their own high quality clinical research.  If the program is successful, it is anticipated that students will return to their academic departments where they will take a prominent role in advancing local research priorities in neurology.  To achieve this objective, NINDS requires a high-impact program for training future researchers that is innovative and that exceeds all other training experiences available to those treating neurological disease.  Currently, more than half of the NINDS extramural clinical trials budget is spent on early phase (phase I, II and pilot) trials.  However, the majority of trials supported through the NINDS pilot study program have not made use of the full range of available trial designs and thus have not been as effective as possible in leading to high-impact definitive clinical trials.  Thus, the primary focus of this solicitation will be on developing researchers with expertise in early phase clinical trials.

Specific goals of the contract are as follows:  (1)  to develop scientific content, curriculum, and format of a comprehensive, hands-on training program incorporating innovative methods of teaching and conducting clinical trial research and taking advantage of knowledge gained in disciplines outside of neurology, with emphasis on early phase/pilot trials;  (2)  to organize and conduct the training program, including recruitment and selection of faculty and participants;  (3)  to conduct formal evaluation of the training program and, where relevant, incorporate results into subsequent course offerings.  Specific requirements of the contract are: (1) develop course content; (2) organize and offer course; (3) recruit course participants; (4) conduct evaluation of training program; and (5) plan, organize, and conduct subsequent training course sessions.

It is anticipated that one cost-reimbursement type contract will be made for a period of five years in February 2007.  This is not a request for Proposals (RFP).  THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY ONLY.  Request for Proposal (RFP) No. NIH-NINDS-06-03 will be available electronically and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps (URL: http://www.fedbisopps.gov) or through the NINDS website at the following URL address: (http://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/currentrfps.htm) 15 or more calendar days after the issuance of this synopsis.  OFFERORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ROUTINELY CHECKING THIS WEBSITE FOR ANY POSSIBLE SOLICITATION AMENDMENTS THAT MAY BE ISSUED.  NO INDIVIDUAL NOTIFICATION OF ANY AMENDMENTS WILL BE PROVIDED.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  Refer to number note 26. ***

These data are highly specialized and the major components thereof are not to be found from any other source with the same coverage and precision.  Any alternate sources that could possibly provide the same data would require duplicating the past data series previously procured with a resultant duplication of cost to the Government that cannot be recovered through competition.  Additionally, the cost of EPA directly funding surveys of specialized markets pesicide data would be many times the cost of procuring these commericially available data.

RFI TECHNICAL INFORMATION:     Substantially Reducing CO emissions from portable engine-powered generators 

A.INTRODUCTION:

The CPSC is concerned about the hazard of acute residential CO exposures from portable gasoline engine-powered generators that can result in death or in serious and/or lasting adverse health effects in exposed individuals.  

Since 1999, the percentage of estimated CO poisoning deaths associated with generators has been increasing annually.  In 1999, generators were associated with 6% of the total yearly estimated CO poisoning deaths.  In 2000, 2001, and 2002, the percentages were 14%, 17%, and 24%, respectively.  Typically, these deaths occur when consumers use a generator in an enclosed space or outdoors near an open door, window or vent.  The output of the majority of light duty generators sold in 2002 was in the 5.1 kW to 6.0 kW range

The CPSC staff is considering various means to limit consumer exposure to the CO produced by portable generators.  One of the strategies being considered is to very substantially limit the tailpipe emission of CO.  

B. REQUEST:

The CPSC staff is interested in obtaining ideas, data, concepts, etc. that may lead to practical approaches to substantially reduce the tailpipe CO emissions from portable gasoline engine-powered generators to levels that could reduce the number of CO poisoning deaths and injuries.  CPSC staff realizes that, while the ideal goal of eliminating the CO poisoning hazard is most likely not feasible, a goal of increasing survivability may be achievable and should be investigated. 

Potential solutions would reduce CO emissions from Class I and/or Class II non-handheld engines within the small spark-ignited engine category to the lowest possible level without negatively affecting engine performance and engine life.  The modified engines would still be required to meet the anticipated EPA Phase III emission requirements.  At the same time, any increase in the fire and burn risk associated with increased temperatures on the exterior of the exhaust system and adjacent engine and generator components must be minimized. Incremental cost increases associated with the CO emission-abatement equipment must be small enough to be consistent with product marketability. 

Based on previous research sponsored by the California Air Resources Board and reviewed by CPSC staff, exhaust catalyst after-treatment, improvements to the engine and/or alternative fuel systems designs may potentially offer realistic solutions.  However, the Government is willing to consider other approaches. CPSC staff has set a tentative target of reducing current emissions by 90% using existing emission-abatement technologies that can be reapplied to small engines. Staff acknowledges this is a very aggressive target, and will consider information on technologies that result in somewhat smaller reductions. Similarly, staff is interested in information that would indicate even further reductions in CO emissions are feasible, to the point of a zero CO-emission system.

We request that responders provide documentation of the technical feasibility of substantially reducing tailpipe emissions in the form of test results (published or clearly marked as proprietary), design options (currently marketed, or proprietary), research (public or proprietary), hardware prototypes with detailed data supporting performance claims, or studies or literature reviews documenting the likely success or failure of achieving a 90% reduction in emissions.  

Parameters we will use in determining technical feasibility will be: 1) amount of CO emissions reduction; 2) effect on engine performance; 3) compatibility with existing engine design; 4) compatibility with anticipated EPA Phase III emission requirements; 5) increased fire/burn risk; and 6) cost.

Responses should be in the form of reports or letters discussing the likely success of achieving the target emissions reductions while meeting the design parameters listed above.  Particular emphasis will be placed on empirical emissions reduction test data.  All conclusions should be supported by such data, preferably in the form of emissions test measurements.  If emissions test results are provided, the test method and data analysis method must be provided in sufficient detail to allow independent analysis of the results.  If the responder provides a compilation of published test results from other sources, the results should be summarized in a form that allows direct comparison of results. 

Responders should address the following questions in their submissions:
1.	What is the minimum CO emissions rate (g/kW-hr.) achievable using currently available technologies without significantly degrading engine performance or life?
2.	What effect if any would the technologies have on engine performance and life?
3.	What is the minimum CO emissions rate (g/kW-hr.) achievable without significantly increasing the risk of fire or consumer burn injuries?
4.	What would be the size and nature of the effect on the temperature of the engine components, exhaust, and exhaust system exterior?
5.	How would existing engines need to be modified to accept the proposed technologies?
6.	How much would successful emissions controls add to the cost of current portable generator designs?
7.	What factors or circumstances could reduce these costs?
8.	What are the tradeoffs between CO emissions reduction, complexity of the emissions control technology, added risk of fire or burn injuries, effect on engine performance and life, and cost?
9.	How long would it take to bring adequate emissions control technology to the market?
10.	Would CO emissions abatement affect the maintenance or service requirements of the generators or their power supply? 
11.	What effects would the proposed technology have on the overall size and portability of the product?
12.	Does the proposed technology require power to operate? 

Responses to this Request For Information (RFI) are to be submitted directly to the Contracting Office address indicated above, Attn: Kim Miles no later April 28, 2006.

<DESC>The Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness (OPHEP) through the Program Support Center (PSC) has a requirement for the development of radiation monitoring of patients for radioactive contamination.

Under Emergency Support Function #8 of the National Response Plan, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is responsible for coordinating the Federal response for public health and medical issues for Incidents of National Significance involving weapons of mass destruction (WMD), including radiological dispersal devices (RDDs).  An RDD event could result in many patients presenting to hospital emergency rooms who may not realize that they have been radioactively contaminated.  Therefore, it is important that hospitals are able to adequately monitor patients for radioactive contamination as early as possible following an incident, in order to properly triage and treat the patients and to protect hospital staff and property.

To address these concerns, HHS has undertaken a program to develop guidelines for radiation monitoring in hospital emergency rooms.  A subgroup of the HHS Radiological Dispersal Device Medical Response Working Group was convened, consisting of experts in health physics who reviewed the types of radiation detection instrumentation currently available and recommended a system of wall-mounted radiation area monitors utilizing sodium iodide detectors.  This Health Physics Subgroup obtained a set of two sodium iodide-based area monitors linked through a software system to a laptop PC to test the system’s response to various radionuclide sources in order to optimize the operating parameters of such a system for use in an emergency room setting.  Having arrived at a set of operating conditions for the area monitor system, the system will now be evaluated under real world conditions in 3 hospital emergency departments. 

The goal of the project is to assess the utility of the system in a hospital emergency room setting including ease of installation, operation and maintenance, instrument response, data collection, computer networking and alarm functionality.  The system will be evaluated under normal operating conditions, as well as during mock incidents with sealed radioactive sources.  Special attention should be paid to the potential for false positive alarms.  The project will also evaluate issues of staff training and response.  The project will conclude with an emergency response exercise simulating the medical and health physics response to an RDD by hospital staff.  The period of performance will be approximately 16 months.  

The radiation monitoring system shall consist of two Ludlum Measurements, Inc. Model 375-10 digital wall-mounted area monitors (or equivalent) connected in parallel to a PC via an Ethernet connection.  These monitors must utilize 2x2 inch sodium iodide scintillation detectors with a low energy discriminator set at 300 keV in order to eliminate most radionuclides used in nuclear medicine and thus reduce the rate of false positive alarms.  The monitors must operate on AC current but shall come equipped with auxiliary battery power to allow for eight hours of operation without AC power.

The detectors must be mounted on each side of the entrance to the emergency room at an approximate height of one meter from the floor.  The power supply shall either be connected to an existing outlet or hard-wired.  Appropriate routing of Ethernet cables shall be necessary in order to be able to monitor the detectors remotely at a PC workstation (i.e., located in the Radiation Safety Office).  Software included with the detectors must be downloaded to the workstation.

The area monitors must be equipped with two LED displays for low and high alarm settings.  The low alarm setting shall be determined by first collecting a background reading for each detector for 24 hours.  The low alarm shall then be set at a value equal to the average background plus two standard

Three Turn-Key Radiation Detection Kits shall be constructed to include radiation detection devices, protocols, training information (CD’s), and access to on-line training.

The Contractor will demonstrate successful experience with: Using a radiation detection device in a hospital emergency department setting.  Designing and instituting training programs to include internet-based and other technologies.  Evaluating hardware and software systems in emergency department settings.  Working in a senior leadership position in an Emergency Department.  Designing projects or studies across multiple institutions.  Evaluating training experiences.  Experience performing the required tasks.  Communicating effectively during interactions with all levels of individuals. Communicating in a written format i.e., writing letters, memoranda, reports, etc., to include government-style correspondence and reports related to public health and emergency management.  The need for specialized technical expertise in working with radioactive materials and detectors. The requirement for an understanding of how Emergency Departments function to include human factors issues.  The ability to successfully negotiate for the placement of three (3) systems in Emergency Departments within a 65 mile radius of HHS HQ and for two (2) additional test sites. 

The project shall be performed in three (3) hospital Emergency Departments (ED) as follows:

1.	All must be located within 65 miles of HHS HQ.  
2.	One location shall be within seven (7) miles of HHS HQ. 
3.	Contractor’s hospital system must have a minimum of two (2) EDs.
4.	At least one (1) ED must be a Level One Shock-Trauma Center in a facility which administers radioactive isotopes. 
5.	HHS will identify two (2) additional EDs in which to pilot equipment and procedures.  


The solicitation will be posted 15 days after this posting.  All questions regarding this requirement shall be e-mailed to Michele Namoski, Contracting Officer.  The solicitation will be posted on this website and no hard copies will be issued.  The RFP Number for this requirement is 06EASPHEP060084.  Proposals will be due 45 days after issuance of the solicitation.

<DESC>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for a five (5) year, $300 million, multiple award, Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC).  There will be approximately three (3) unrestricted and two (2) small business set-aside awards.  However the number of awards will be based upon the best value determination of the Contracting Officer.  The anticipated small business subcontracting percentage will be 40% of the contract ceiling. Of that percentage, a 15% requirement will be allocated to Small Disadvantaged Business participation. Perspective offerors are encouraged to use the following Small Business Administration (SBA) website to identify potential small businesses in support of the requirements set forth above:     http://web.sba.gov/subnet/


The Prosperity, Livelihoods and Conserving Ecosystems (PLACE) IQC will support the Natural Resources Management Office’s (EGAT/NRM) Strategic Objective (SO) “Increased social, economic and environmental benefits through healthy ecosystems and sustainable resource management”.  The Intermediate Results (IRs) associated with this SO include:  

IR1: 	Improving management and conservation across diverse landscapes through science, interdisciplinary approaches and the adoption of best practices; 
IR2: 	Promoting equitable natural resources governance and management of natural resource conflicts;
IR3: 	Increasing economic opportunities through sustainable production, marketing and trade of natural resource-based products and services; and 
IR4: 	Strengthening USAID operating units and partners through field support, technical leadership and knowledge management.

The awardee(s) will be expected to respond rapidly to requests from USAID Missions and Bureaus for technical assistance in carrying out integrated approaches to managing the biophysical, social, governance and economic components of natural resources management and biodiversity conservation.  Activities may include interventions at multiple spatial scales from the household to issues of global dimension.

The awardee(s) shall furnish personnel having substantial experience and expertise, both practical and conceptual, to perform the range of activities described by this Statement of Work, and as further delineated in subsequent Task Orders. Awardee(s) will be expected to respond in a comprehensive and technically sound manner to Performance-Based Task Orders from all USAID clients. This form of Task Order describes and quantifies the results expected and provides target levels or standards of performance, but is not prescriptive in detailing the means to reach desired outcomes.

The technical assistance provided by the awardee(s) will address a wide range of topics relating to varied aspects of natural resources management. USAID anticipates that some commodity procurement, equipment installation, and/or the making of small grants to host-country organizations will be called for under various Task Orders.

The awardee(s) will be expected to work primarily with host country government institutions (national, provincial, and local) charged with management and decision-making responsibilities in biodiversity conservation and natural resources management and/or local NGOs, private sector entities, academic/research institutions and community/civil society organizations that are stakeholders in sound resource management and conservation. 

This mechanism will replace and build on the BIOFOR IQC in providing USAID Missions/Offices and their partners with a broad range of technical assistance components in order to address complex development needs across multi-use landscapes.  These components can be divided into three categories: 1) overarching themes; 2) Primary Natural Resource Management Categories; and 3) Cross-Cutting Resource Management Approaches.  

Overarching Themes

1. Integrated Landscape/Seascape Management
2. Scaling-up & Sustaining Impact
3. Supporting Fragile and Transformational States

Primary Natural Resource Management Categories

1. Biodiversity Conservation (terrestrial, fresh-water and marine) 
2. Sustainable Forestry
3. Sustainable Tourism 
4. Sustainable Agriculture
5. Provision of Ecosystem Services

   	Cross-cutting Natural Resource Management Approaches
1. Governance and Policy Reform
2. Property & Resource Rights
3. Institutional Strengthening & Capacity Building
4. Enterprise Development
5. Sustainable Finance
6. Conflict Mitigation & Management
7. Gender and strengthening the role of women and disadvantaged   groups
8. Small Grants Management

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Space Environment Center (SEC), (hereinafter referred to as the Government) is seeking potential vendors to provide analytical services in supporting the GOES R Risk Reduction effort for development of space weather products from solar remote sensing instrumentation and geosynchronous in situ plasma and energetic particle instrumentation. At this time, the Government is conducting market research. This is not a request for proposals, only a Request for Information (RFI).

Background
The GOES R Risk Reduction effort is intended to ensure that the Government is fully prepared to utilize the data expected from improved instruments on the GOES R spacecraft, which is currently planned for launch in 2012. GOES R solar instrumentation will include a soft X-ray imager, a disk-integrated, two-channel soft X-ray sensor, and a disk-integrated, extreme ultraviolet, spectrometer. In addition, it could include a white light coronagraph.  The GOES-R plasma and energetic particle instruments will include electrostatic analyzers and multiple solid state telescopes. These data will be combined with data from the vector magnetometer. Analysis of data and product utilization, validation, and product development will be conducted. The specific analyses requirements are detailed in Attachment 1 (Potential List of Analysis Tasks).  While performing these analyses, contractors will be expected to work collaboratively with staff of the NOAA Space Environment Center.  Since the GOES R instrument data are not yet available, proxy data sets and products currently available from other NOAA, NASA or international missions will be used for the analyses. 

Purpose/Specific Request
The purpose of this request for information is to determine (i) if there are sources capable of satisfying any or all of the Government’s requirements, (ii) the clarity, feasibility, and scope of the Government’s requirements, (iii) if there are potential alternative means of meeting the Government’s requirements by receiving comments from industry.  Industry capability is to be assessed based on the following factors: (A) direct corporate experience from past efforts in similar studies. Please provide a point of contact (name and phone number), (B) key personnel (please include a brief curriculum vitae), and (C) a statement of capabilities. In addition to comments, those interested are requested to provide a budgetary estimate for tasks that your organization is capable of performing.

Your response should identify your business size (large or small) in relation to this NIACS Code.  The anticipated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 541990 and the small business size standard is $6.5 million.  If your company has revenue equal to or exceeding $6.5 million you are considered a large business.  

NOAA will consider all comments, supporting or critical, but may or may not use these individual comments.  Interested sources are also encouraged to submit product or services literature in response to this Request for Information (RFI).  ***Any submission of such product/services literature will be treated separate from, and will have no bearing on, any subsequent evaluation of proposal submitted in response to any resulting future formal Request for Proposals. NOAA will not pay for information or comments provided and will not recognize any costs associated with submission of comments.  NOAA as noted above is assessing the existence of sources and is defining a strategy for future procurements.  Written responses shall be sent by e-mail to susan.labovitz@noaa.gov.  The e-mails shall be sent no later than 2:00 P.M. Mountain Time, Friday, April 14, 2006.  Telephone responses are not acceptable.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<ARCHDATE>06242006
<CONTACT>Peggy DeLuca, 732-427-6093
<DESC>Notice Date:     April 2006 Response Due:  NLT 25 April 2006 Points of Contact Contracting Officer: Linda A. Schmidt, Phone:  732-427-1323  e-mail: Linda.Schmidt@us.army.mil PM Radars POC: Tom Kosinski, Phone:  732-532-4665; e-mail: Tom.Kosinski@us.army.mil Description:  This is a request for information only.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The US Army PM Radars is seeking sources and information to perform long term (up to ten [10] years) interim logistics support to sustain approximately 38 LCM R Increment I systems (currently fielded), approximately 54 LCMR Increment II systems (fielding to commence in May 2006) and approximately 442 LCMR Increment III systems (fielding to begin in Fiscal Year [FY] 09).  In addition, PM Radars is seeking sources  and information regarding the overhaul of approximately thirty-eight (38) LCMR Increment I systems to the latest LCMR Increment II configuration.  The Government possesses no technical data package for the LCMR Program. Item Definition:  The LCMR is a lightweight, 360-degree, rapidly man-transportable, digitally connected, day/night mortar, cannon and rocket locating radar that uses computer-controlled signal processing of the radar signal data to perform target detection , verification, tracking, and classification of enemy and friendly mortars.  The system consists of an Antenna Transceiver Group (ATG) powered by battery or external generator.  Data processing is performed by the Radar Processor (RP) in the ATG and sent t o the Portable Display Unit (PDU).  The LCMR will be located in the Fires Battalion of both the Current and Future Force Units of Action.   a. The LCMR system shall have a 91% probability that 1 of 2 systems operate failure-free over a 72 hour mission pulse.  Rationale:  The LCMR is a low density system and must maintain continuous operations with minimal down time. b. The LCMR system shall have a 95% average operational availability (Ao).  Rationale:  The LCMR is a low density system and must maintain continuous operations with minimal down time. c. The LCMR system operators shall perform 80% of all unscheduled maintenance.  Rationale:  Key to maximizing the system availability and increasing self-sufficiency. d. The LCMR system shall have a field and sustainment maintenance ratio not to exceed 0.05 maintenance man hours per operating hour.  Rationale:  Ensures that the radar is maintained within the maintenance force structure constraints. e. The LCMR system Maximum Time to Repair at Field Level will not exceed 30 minutes for 90% of the maintenance tasks performed at this maintenance level.  Rationale:  The LCMR is a low density system and must maintain continuous operations with minimal dow n time. Requirements:  Approximately 34 LCMR I systems are fielded in theater supporting Operation Iraq Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF) operations.  By December 2006, 54 LCMR II systems will be fielded.  LCMR Increment III has yet to be developed, but  PM Radars anticipates First Unit Equipped for Increment III to occur in FY09. Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) may include, but not necessarily be limited to: material and facilities, as well as services, in the following areas:  (1) supply & distribution; (2) maintenance; (3) training; (4) software support; (5) rebuild/overhaul; (6) repair (CONUS & OCONUS); (7) repair and return (if the unit cannot be repair OCONUS); (8) modifications/upgrades/updates to hardware/software/firmware and (9) system support.  Seamless and transparent transition from in-garrison to deployment support w ill be required. LCMR maintenance and support will be composed of a mix of Government Logistics Assistance Representatives (LARs) and Contractor Field Service Engineers (FSEs) located at C4ISR Regional Support Centers (RSCs).  The C4ISR RSCs provide direct and integrated g eneral support as well as some limited depot support for other systems in OIF/OEF.  It serves as a centralized single  face to the field for a broad range of engineering, management, logistics and technical services.  Although the Government will provide these RSC facilities, the Contractor may be required to travel to remote and hostile areas.  Contractor-provided FSEs shall be co-located and integrated in theater at one or more of the following RSC locations (subject to change): 	IRAQ						AFGHANISTAN 	Tikrit (Camp Speicher)				Bagram 	Balad (Camp Anaconda)				Kandahar 	Baghdad (Camp Liberty/Victory) 	Mosul (Camp Diamond Back)         Al Ramadi A 2-level maintenance concept at the operational unit (Field) and Echelon Above Unit (EAU) (Depot) levels and provide ILS CONUS and OCONUS will be implemented.  This shall include, but not necessarily be limited to:  on-site and off-site repairs, 24/7 on c all services when a system is returned from the field to include maintenance, product support, shipping, training, documentation and manual updates to the LCMR program.  Any resultant contract will include the requirement to:  provide technical support for  damaged systems returned from the field, which shall include, but not be limited to, troubleshooting, repairs and test of failed systems; provide depot level support to include repair parts/field maintenance kits for all LCMR Increments I and II systems a nd the yet to be developed Increment III systems; provide FSEs for technical support of the system in the field, which shall include, but not be limited to, troubleshooting, repairs and test of failed systems, and operator guidance and training; provide up dated electronic technical documentation sufficient for soldiers to operate, maintain and train on the equipment in forward areas of the battlefield; document and implement a components and materials obsolescence program and monitor and evaluate electronic  part life cycle status and availability on the system design throughout the duration of the contract; provide training and documentation necessary for both Contractor and Government to be able to perform in-theater maintenance above unit level and conduct  unit and Government LAR training in theater.  Ease of supportability in the field environment is paramount. A wartime operational readiness supportability rate of 99.5% is a requirement.  Repair parts and personnel required to maintain stock levels to meet this readiness requirement is a critical element of any future requirement. When field failures occur and the Contractor FSE or Government LAR determines that the LCMR cannot be repaired in country, the established turnaround time for CONUS repair is a maximum of thirty (30) days once received at the Contractor CONUS depot to the time the repaired unit is received at the designated CONUS acceptance point.  The established turnaround time for OCONUS repair, once an evaluation indicates an item can be repaired within country, is twenty-four (24) hours with the item being repaired and  returned to the LAR. Records shall be maintained of all repair/replacement actions detailing inventory of all equipment, returned equipment by name, part number and serial number, maintenance actions underway, repairs completed, labor hours and categories expended for repairs and repair price/cost of repairs, repair/replacement action taken, why a repair or replacement decision was made, date each item was received for repair, and whether the item is covered by warranty and the date/time repaired or replaced item was shipped ba ck to the Government. Product Support Integrator (PSI) responsibilities for Increments I and II shall reside with the Contractor.  The Product Support Integrator (PSI) responsibilities for Increment III shall remain with PM Radars, Ft. Monmouth, NJ until award of any full rate production contract.  The contractor shall take on the role of Product Support Provider (PSP) to provide monthly report to the PSI with all metrics, detailed inventories, cost estimates to repair, and transportation discrepancies. The Contractor awarded any resultant contract shall develop Performance Based Logistics (PBL) metrics by establishing a baseline for the LCMRs logistics footprint.  The PBL metrics shall be developed as early as possible in the LCMR Life Cycle and become part  of the design and implementation process to provide information to assist in the Core Depot Assessment.  All collection of data shall be at the lowest level of detail and allow for visible cost drivers. The Contractor awarded any resultant contract shall provide a life cycle sustainment plan for the LCMR to be implemented using Public-Private Partnering (P3) incorporating metrics to measure performance and assure cost containment.  A Leader-Follower strat egy for life cycle sustainment shall be implemented with the leader being the contractor and the follower as the depot.  The Leader-Follower Plan (LFP) will articulate how the Contractor (OEM), the Program Management Office and the Organic Sustainer will m utually design, manufacture, field, and sustain the system. The Contractor awarded any resultant contract will develop an organic sustainment capability and transition plan.  The Contractor will assure that the organic depot has the capability to sustain the said equipments no later than the first unit equipped (FU E) that is, the required hardware, software, technical documentation and training.  The contractor will implement a two level maintenance capability utilizing, where feasible, Government Field Service Representatives (FSRs) at Forward Repair Activities (FR As) to serve in a base sustainment capacity. The Contractor awarded any resultant contract shall complete a Level of Repair Analysis (LORA) or an equivalent model and utilize the results to support a Best Value Business Case Analysis which shall include the following metrics to be measured:       A.  The Logistics Response Time (LRT) for the LCMR System is defined as the period of time from a logistics demand signal sent to satisfaction of that logistics demand.  This requirement can be provided to the Government via a Technical Discrepancy R eport.       B.  The Repair Cycle Time per System failure (the elapsed time from the receipt of a failure item at a repair facility until the time the item is repaired and ready for reissue to the user).  The contractor shall monitor and record the transportation  time of a failed LCMR item as a metric  and provide this information and any delays beyond the prescribed 96 Hour Turn-Around-Time to the Government.       C.  The Stock Availability at Units forward supply level (time to fill a Line Replaceable Unit by the units forward supply support).       D.  Maintenance Driven Sub-Elements called Not Mission Capable Maintenance (NMCM) (time system is inoperable due to delay in obtaining maintenance resources.)       E.  The Contractor shall provide accurate data collection process of the Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability (RAM) system information, MANPRINT, spiral development by enhancing BIT/BITE requirements, sustainment training, and personnel.  T he contractor shall use the transportation time to move parts as a metrics Packaging Handling Storage and Transportation. Using an open architecture will aide and lower the footprint by modernization through technology insertion and sparing.       F.  The contractor shall maintain and report LCMR System Life Cycle Sustainment Costs and achieve the optimized System Operational Availability (Ao).  The anticipated LCMR Ao is 95%. Overhaul of Increment I to Increment II Configuration:  Overhaul converts an LCMR Increment I system into the LCMR Increment II configuration.  These overhauled Increment II systems shall be identical in form, fit and function to those Increment II systems  currently in fabrication.  After FUE, Increment II systems may be overhauled to Increment III systems. Questions/Information Requested:  In providing your response to this announcement, please ensure you address  the following as well as provide any additional data/information you feel necessary for the Government to assess the availability of suppliers for this level of service. 1. The Government intends to implement a Performance Based Logistics Strategy for this requirement.  Please explain fully how you would implement PBL in a system that has been fielded.  Please detail performance characteristics you feel are measurable as p art of a PBL strategy?  Include any relative experience that demonstrates your capability to act as a PSI.  Your response should provide your past PBL accomplishments and the methods and metrics used to develop a support concept to reduce the logistics foo tprint.  Provide the type of planning your company used to manage the supply chain (Parts Support) for field and sustainment level maintenance and integrating it with the anticipated organic capability and transition. 2. How would you approach this long term ILS effort?  Describe your processes and methodologies to effect the transition from the current ILS provider of Increment I and II systems (the OEM, Syracuse Research Corporation)? 3. Describe how you would partner with a U. S. Army organic element to satisfy the Armys long range goal of depot capability for all repair and return and inventory management efforts for the LCMR System.  This capability has not been incorporated to date .  Please detail your approach to involving a depot, identifying how you would engulf them into the processes and provide a reasonable timeline to transition 100% repair and return and inventory management functions to that depot. 4. To accomplish the Governments requirements outlined in this announcement is there anything you feel the Government must provide to make it happen? The Government will not reimburse contractors or responders to this notice for any costs incurred in responding, or in any subsequent exchange of information. All proprietary and restricted information shall be clearly marked.  All information shall be sub mitted no later than April 25, 2006.

Work under the proposed supplement agreement will consist of the design-build replacement of the existing concrete floor in the AEOS buildings Lift Room based on the load capacity of the AEOS mirror and appurtenances at approximately 50,000 lbs.  The proposed sole source contractor, San Juan Construction, Inc., is currently designing the concrete floor in the adjoining Mirror Coating Facility at the very restrictive Maui Space Surveillance Site atop Haleakala, Maui.  The estimated construction cost for this req uirement is $90,000.  The Government requests that any interested contractors respond by May 4, 2006.

<DESC>The goal of the electronics program is to develop and transition affordable, high  performance Radio Frequency (RF) electronics that will provide a decisive edge to the warfighter.
The program encompasses RF research, design, modeling, fabrication, and testing of  devices, integrated circuits, and multi-chip assemblies that span digital, analog, microwave and millimeter wave technologies. Toward that end the Electronics Science and Technology Program invests in science and technology initiatives that will provide the present Navy, the Next Navy, and Navy After Next with electronics technology to meet these needs.  

The ONR Science and Technology Program is divided into three parts - Discovery and Invention (D&I), Exploitation and Deployment (E&D),  and Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP).  The goals of the D&I program are to develop technologies that are applicable to the more far-term needs of the operational forces.  Efforts within the E&D Program focus primarily on the Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs) that have been selected by the Navy and Marine Corps leadership.  The focus of the E&D Program is technology development to satisfy the more near-to-midterm needs of the operational forces.  Efforts within the INP Program focus on near-term but high risk development of prototypes that could be fielded rapidly to provide significant advantages to the warfighter.  

The applications areas that provide the strongest pull for the Electronics Program are Electronic Warfare, Surveillance, and Communications Technologies.  Within Surveillance the primary thrusts are Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance, Element-Level Digital Array Radar and Non-Cooperative Target Recognition.  Within Electronic Warfare the primary thrusts are Situational Awareness, Threat Detection, and Threat ID, Counter Targeting, Self Protection, and Support Jamming, and Network Centric EW/Mission Support. Within  Communications the primary thrusts are Spectral and Energy Efficient Communications, Tactical Communications, and Dynamic Ad-hoc Wireless Networks and Internetworking.  The electronics needs of these programs are included in the information provided below.

<DESC>Increased use of portable electronics such as cellular phones, laptop computers and PDAs over the last several years has increased the demand for compact, low cost, and environmentally friendly rechargeable batteries.  Lithium based Solid Polymer Electrolyte (SPE) batteries have emerged as a forerunner in this growing technology.  SPE batteries use solid lithium based polymers as their electrolyte (in place of traditional liquid electrolyte) sandwiched between a lithium metal sheet and a metal oxide sheet.  This laminate construction allows for the creation of batteries which are as thin as a credit card and which can be configured in many different shapes and sizes.  The use of a polymer electrolyte is also much safer and more environmentally friendly than traditional battery technologies.  
Presently, the most attractive cathode materials for use in SPE batteries are Li-based metal oxides.  These compounds are in a class of compounds known as intercalation compounds which allow the insertion and removal of guest species (especially metal ions) into their crystalline lattice structures.  Traditionally, Li-based intercalation compounds have been formed by a mixed oxide process, in which the oxides react at high temperatures to form the desired compound.  Typical methods require mixing of solid oxides followed by a high temperature calcination (heating) process in the temperature range of 600-1000°C.  Many of these processes also require long heating times in the range of 5 hours to several days and multiple heating and/or grinding steps.  The long heating times and multiple grinding steps required by such processes drive up production costs considerably and introduce impurities.
The patented invention elucidates a method to produce Li-based intercalation powders in less time and at a lower cost for use in secondary batteries and other applications.  It relates to a process for preparing lithium intercalation compounds by plasma reaction.
The INL is soliciting a written indication of interest from industry partners interested in funding a collaborative technology development project and/or entering into a license agreement for the purpose of developing and commercializing this technology.  
Interested parties should respond thirty (30) days after publication.  Interested parties should send a description of their company and their ability to commercialize this technology to the contact listed below.  Any questions or inquiries should be directed to the contact listed below.

<DESC>This follow up notice announces completion of a trade study conducted by the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, Detachment Norfolk (NSWCCDDN) for clean-fuel technology (CFT) prime movers suitable for use in propulsion systems for new ferry boats to be procured for the USS ARIZONA Memorial in Pearl Harbor, HI.  Information received from the original notice was used to assess the emissions and noise reduction benefits and the technical, cost, schedule and logistical feasibility and maturity of various CFT prime movers for this application.  The following information summarizes the findings and recommendations of the study: Based on an assessment of conventional and alternative fuels, the following are identified as suitable fuels for CFT propulsion systems on the new ferry boats:  (1) conventional diesel; (2) Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD); (3) Biodiesel.  Other fuels (including propane, natural gas and hydrogen) are not recommended for various reasons, including the lack of applicable regulations for marine propulsion use; lack of availability on Oahu; and significant impact to infrastructure.  The study recommends new ferry boat systems be optimized for biodiesel fuel (up to 100% biodiesel, B100) where practicable. Based on an assessment of five CFT propulsion system conceptual configurations, the following are identified as viable CFT propulsion systems for the new ferry boats: (1) Conventional direct drive diesel propulsion system using EPA Tier 2 emissions-compliant diesel engines; (2) Hybrid electric vehicle (HEV)-Series system consisting of EPA Tier 2 emissions-compliant diesel engine-powered generators, electric drive motors, and nickel metal hydride (Nimh) battery banks.  Of the two viable CFT options, the HEV-Series configuration is recommended for the new ferry boats.  The HEV-Series configuration reduces fuel consumption, reduces the volume of air emissions, and demonstrates an evolutionary step towards eventual fielding of a zero-emissions propulsion system for boats.  Additionally, the study recommends new ferry boat engines be equipped with exhaust catalyst and fuel-borne catalyst systems (where practicable and available) to provide further air emission reductions.  Other !  CFT options (HEV-Battery Electric Vehicle, HEV-Parallel, HEV-Series with hydrogen fuel cell) are not recommended for various reasons, including lack of maturity of associated systems; issues with integrating the CFT system on the boat; unsatisfactory mission performance; and significant fielding costs for the CFT or associated infrastructure. The majority of U.S. Navy boats are currently procured from the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) schedule.  The study concludes that the typical GSA boat acquisition strategy used by PEO SHIPS (PMS 325G) is feasible, and it recommends this strategy be used for the new ferry boats, with special attention given to the unique aspects related to CFT propulsion systems and federal accessibility requirements.   This is a Sources Sought Notice.  This announcement is not a Request For Proposal (RFP) and is not be construed as a commitment by the Government to award a contract or contracts at this time.  The Government is not requesting submission of information per this follow up notice and will not pay for any information that is provided in response to this announcement nor will it compensate any respondents for the development of an such information.

In this ongoing project with the Southeast Fisheries Science Center. Potential Sources must be able to demonstrate an ability to work effectively with the large amounts of data (>40,000 records) included in the St. Lucie fish health database.    

Project objectives are to (1) determine sources of variation and trends in the prevalence of abnormalities in fish of the St. Lucie estuarine system and nearby reference sites, (2) relate the prevalence of abnormalities to freshwater inflow and other environmental variables, and (3) develop performance measures that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of regional and local restoration and remediation projects.  Duties are described below.  .   

DESC: The required work will consist of the following:

Statistical analyses of the field-collected data are an important element of the overall study and the major component of this service order.  Planned continued sampling will add an additional year to the database and strengthen the basis for the analyses.  The expanded data base is expected to enhance the ability, through logistic regression analysis, to separate species differences from time/space differences, examine individual species, and relate the prevalence of abnormal fish to environmental variables and other potential influencing factors.  

The provider shall:

1) expand the existing database with the new data as it becomes available from the field component of the project and will perform quality assurance.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business or HUBZone small businesses capable of providing the following:  Build and commission three respiratory chambers located in the Hatfield Clinical Research Center at NIH.  These respiratory chambers are critical to the conduct of research in the area of obesity and are used to determine the metabolic rate of research subjects.  In contrast to conventional respiratory chambers, requirements for the three NIH respiratory chambers include:

1) Size large enough to accommodate obese subjects up to 600 lbs;
2) Modifications to allow procurement of research samples during the 24 hour metabolic studies;
3) Integration of all components to assure high sensitivity and high-resolution data acquisition so that metabolic changes can be assessed rapidly;
4) Take no more than 18 months to set up, integrate and commission three chambers.

The vendor will assure that the necessary materials and equipment including high-precision sensors, high-end gas – sampling and conditioning devices and high-resolution data-acquisition hardware are used according to design.  The vendor will set-up, mount, and integrate all chamber hardware components, sensors, plumbing, and accessories according to design.  The vendor will integrate all sensors (pressure, temperature, humidity, activity and flow) to the data acquisition board and verify accuracy of the data.  The vendor will perform zero and span calibration, and quantify noise level on oxygen and carbon dioxide analyzers.  The vendor will design the gas sampling configuration and customize the analysis software to achieve proper noise suppression for rapid resolution of metabolic changes.  The vendor will determine the accuracy of the chamber using a series of propane burns and varying noise suppression windows down to 15 minute while keeping error to 2% or less.  Optimization of the noise suppression window and validation of the time resolution of the chamber must be performed by injecting mixed gas (20% CO2, 80%N2) for various intervals.  Chamber measurements need to be conducted on human volunteers to measure resting energy expenditure and metabolic changes with exercise.  The vendor will work with investigators at the NIH to conduct 24 hour chamber measurement in 10 human volunteers for reproducibility of 24 hour energy expenditure, 24 hour respiratory quotient, and short term energy expenditure and respiratory quotient.  The vendor will provide NIH investigators with an operating manual, and on-site training for staff.  The vendor must supply sufficient warranty for labor and technical support for a period of 6 months after completion to assure proper functioning of the chambers.  Each chamber measures about 11’ 7” x 12’ 6-1/2” which is approximately a total of 438 square feet.  These are freestanding chambers surrounded by a “buffer zone” of approximately 1-2 feet.  The rooms where the chambers are located are approximately 13’ x 14’ not including a separate area for the instrumentation that services the chambers.  

This request is for interested firms with the capability of providing the required equipment to submit a capability statement along with projected pricing, to assist the Government in determining in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.502-29b) whether or not this procurement will be set-aside for any of the programs described above.  The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) code 339112 with a size standard of 500 employees.  All respondents are requested to identify their firm’s size and type of business.  Interested firms responding to this market survey must provide (a) capability statement demonstrating their experience, skills and capability to fulfill the Government’s requirements for the above.  The capability statement shall be in sufficient enough detail, but not to exceed 10 pages, so that the Government can determine the experience and capability of your firm to provide the requirements above.  Your capability statement, not to exceed 10 pages, should include references.  A copy of the capability statement must be received at the address identified in this synopsis by no later than close of business (5:00p.m local time at designated location) on April 13, 2006.  Responses by fax or e-mail WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

<DESC>Network Centric Warfare-Digital Battlefield Instrumentation (NCW-DBI) Solutions
Request for Information (RFI)

Closing Date:  17 April 2006

The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI); Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS); Instrumentation Management Office (IMO) in support of providing major instrumentation for the US Army Operational and Developmental Testing Communities to test and evaluate Future Force communications networks and Warfighting technologies, is seeking information from interested parties that have existing instrumentation that can be upgraded to support the multiple mission needs of testing at the system level and in a Force-on-Force Network Centric Warfare (NCW) environment.  It is the desire of PM ITTS to expand on the existing capabilities of the Army’s existing Improved Field Data Collector (IFDC) V4 system as the foundation for this initiative. Responders must have experience with the IFDC V4 and have the means to grow and expand its current capabilities to support the future mission objectives addressed herein.  If alternate considerations are submitted, the instrumentation and capability would, at some level, have supported US Army testing missions, have been designed and tested to insure required performance in the tactical and training operational environment, be able to interface directly with multiple tactical radios and LANs to provide ground truth of the tactical communications networks, interface to the Weapon systems’ data bus to monitor and record messages as well as provide some level of message injection, provide Real Time Casualty Assessment (RTCA) by interfacing to existing RTCA systems and performing stand-alone internal Force-on-Force adjudication for both direct and indirect fire events, and provide a direct injection jamming capability to simulate threat emitters.  The desired system would provide correlated data based on each instrumented component and be able to support secure communications and provide tamper proof housings at each instrumentation node.

Capabilities:

Specific capabilities for each of the four integrated Network Centric Warfare – Digital Battlefield Instrumentation (NCW-DBI) capabilities sought include:
 
1.  Tactical Communications Analysis is needed at each node in the battlefield (weapon systems and dismounted soldiers) to provide ground truth of both tactical network, LAN communication and individual point to point communications.  Specific element capabilities desired include, but are not limited to: Data collection platforms such as JTRS Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW), Man pack, small form fit variants (soldiers, UAV/UGV), IFDCv4 enhancement/upgrades (secure, tamper-proof), smaller, more powerful, higher speed data collection (Gig-E LAN, USB 2.0), emerging physical interfaces and data formats (USB, Firewire, IPv6, XML, sensor data, and JVMF), and Current Force Systems (JNN, Win-T, VoIP), including the Wideband Network Waveform (WNW) and JTRS Cluster 1.
  
2.  Weapon Systems Data Bus interface and message filtering capability is desired to capture and process digital message traffic on various weapon system data busses.  The interface should be capable of selecting specific messages of interest, and be reprogrammable to support various data bus implementations and message content.  The interface should be able to provide critical data elements to other portions of the NCW-DBI system to support aggregated and correlated performance assessments.  The capability should exist to have access to system information based on crew actions and performance right off the system.

3.	The threat jamming simulation component of NCW-DBI is desired to have both a direct injection jamming simulation capability and a software simulated jamming capability.  The direct injection component must be threat accredited to replicate expected RF wave forms directly into the tactical communications systems to preclude the need for over the air jamming.  It is highly desired that the direct injection jamming component of NCW-DBI provide multiple simultaneous threat waveforms, be able to monitor and control jamming assets thru Starship, and have interfaces to support smaller, more mobile Electronic Warfare (EW) instrumentation. 

4.  Real Time Casualty Assessment (RTCA) capability is required to provide direct and indirect Force-on-Force engagement simulation.  The RTCA architecture must be expandable in terms of both software modeling and hardware interfacing to support future growth.  The RTCA component of NCW-DBI should be capable of interfacing to existing MILES and MAIS Family of Devices and be expandable to interface to new laser based paring devices and geo-paring devices and software models.


RFI Purpose and Limitations:

The Government’s intention is to better understand the current state-of-the-art and to determine the best acquisition approach.  Industry feedback is vitally important and the Government will be receptive to any and all ideas received from industry.  This RFI is an expression of the Government’s interest only and does not obligate the Government to pay for the requested information nor respond to any submissions.

<DESC>Description
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is seeking to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to work with an electrical safety equipment manufacturer to design, test, and evaluate the marketability of the Electrical Injury Protection System (EIPS), personal protective equipment for electrical workers and electricians, which is being developed by NIOSH.  The goal of this project is to improve the safety of electrical workers/electricians by bringing the EIPS into the marketplace.  This announcement is a business opportunity in that the partner selected will share expertise with NIOSH researchers toward making the EIPS a viable and profitable piece of safety equipment.

An investigation of fatal occupational electrocutions in the U.S. between 1992 and 1999 shows that most fatal occupational electrocutions were attributed to contact with overhead power lines (1046, 41.4%).  Another investigation of occupational electrocution fatalities shows that a large percentage of electrocution victims were working around an electrical circuit that was not de-energized (54%) and/or were working without the presence of a GFCI (98%).  The investigation also shows that 47% of the victims did not use lock-out/tag-out procedures.  

In order to address these risk factors, NIOSH is developing the EIPS to reduce the occupational fatality and injury rates related to contact with electrical energy.  The EIPS uses a 60-Hz electric-field sensor, which is mounted either on a human body or on a piece of metal equipment, to detect the proximity of, or electrical contact with, a worker or a piece of metal equipment to an energized power line or electrical circuit at low (less than 600 volts) or high voltage (at least 600 volts).  The sensor will setoff an audible and/or visual alarm as it detects the human/equipment proximity or electrical contact. To further protect the workers from electrocution, the system can also include a controller which is plugged into a low voltage (less than 600 volts) electrical circuit.  The controller can setoff an audible/visual alarm, and trip a GFCI (if in place), or a circuit breaker on its plugged-in electrical circuit (when the controller receives a radio-frequency tripping command transmitted from the electric-field sensor as the sensor detects the human/equipment electrical contact with this electrical circuit).  The controller trips the GFCI and the circuit breaker by generating artificial excessive line-to-ground and line-to-neutral currents on the circuit, respectively.  Alternatively, the controller can be re-configured as a lock-out/tag-out condition monitor.  In this configuration, the controller can setoff an alarm and trip a circuit breaker or GFCI on its plugged-in primary electrical circuit as the circuit is re-energized.  The controller is also able to setoff an alarm as other electrical circuits adjacent to the primary circuit are re-energized.

The project is currently in the system development phase.  Electronic circuit and tripping mechanism development are underway.  System development is scheduled to be completed in early 2006. 

Candidate companies, which appear to provide the most promise of meeting the requirements listed below, will be evaluated based on their capability to complete the research and development needed to bring the EIPS into commercial production.   This announcement does not obligate NIOSH to sign an MOU with any presented company.  NIOSH reserves the right to establish a partnership based on engineering analysis/evaluation capabilities found under this announcement or other searches, if determined to be in the best interest of the government. 

EIPS Commercialization Capabilities Parameters: (Companies should try to meet as many of these requirements as possible, but highly innovative solutions without testing are not discouraged from presentation or response.) 

(A) Provide significant intellectual, engineering, and technical expertise in manufacturing personal electrical-injury protection equipment.  This would include defining the cost and usability needs of the electrical personal protective equipment market.  Also, assistance will be given in setting realistic product cost objectives and providing suggestions on how the EIPS can achieve product cost goals - Required; 

(B) Fabricate prototypes for test and evaluation - Required; 

(C) Provide expertise to NIOSH in designing and conducting field evaluations; 

(D) Review testing methods and recommend appropriate, new testing criteria; and

(E) Review test results and recommend design modifications.


NIOSH is seeking an innovative partner to address these major areas.  A company that is qualified and currently producing electrical personal protective equipment is highly desired.  However, past testing and design of equipment similar to EIPS is not required.  If prior testing has been performed the test information and results should be provided.  Interested parties responding to this request should provide detailed information regarding capabilities, test results, and cost data.  Presentation material may consist of literature, electronic presentation, or video. (Samples and data provided to the government as part of this solicitation will not be returned to vendors following the completion of this project.)  Vendors may be offered the opportunity to meet with representatives of the project team following a review of all submitted data. Data and/or product samples must be delivered to Shengke Zeng at NIOSH within two weeks (10 business days) of the closing of this announcement.  Although every effort will be made to consider all information received, the government will not be obligated to evaluate information received after the two week period.  If any data are to be excluded from exchange with any of the project participants, a statement of that fact shall be included by the vendors with a statement of propriety.  Presentations from interested vendors are optional but encouraged.  The government has identified May 23rd and 24th, 2006 for these presentations to be conducted.  The Government reserves the right to identify an alternate meeting date if those identified are not viable for one or more interested vendors.

SUBJECT: The NMFS intends to award a sole source purchase order base and four option years to  Fernanda Aguiar Kandrashoff for field assistance in a study of the prevalence of fish with abnormalities in the St. Lucie estuarine system and nearby reference sites.  Fernanda Aguiar Kandrashoff has been trained by the original samplers on the ongoing project that this activity supports.  She is accomplished at capturing fish, has been trained to screen fish for abnormalities, and has been trained in the procedures and codes for recording fish species and specific types of abnormalities according to the protocols of the long-term project. It is critically important to the success of the project to maintain continuity in methods and continue the sampling without interruption.  Otherwise, the data could be lost or seriously compromised.  
Project objectives are to (1) quantify the most obvious sources of variation in the prevalence of abnormal fish (taxonomic, temporal, spatial, and type of abnormality), (2) standardize an index of prevalence for sources of variation that might confound the ability to discern trends, (3) determine trends over time, (4) compare the St. Lucie estuarine system to nearby reference areas, (5) characterize the abnormalities miscroscopically, and (5) examine the relationship of prevalence to potential causal factors.  The objective of the field component of the St. Lucie project is to sample the fish of the St. Lucie estuarine system and a reference site to extend a multi-year database and facilitate statistical analyses.  This announcement relates to obtaining assistance in conducting field sampling three days per week on a variable schedule established based on tide, weather, and other conditions that may affect sampling.

DESC: The required work will consist of the following:

I. Assistance in sampling fish.  
II. Record, in a data book, the species, length, and condition (including type and location of abnormality) of the fish caught.  
III. Assistance in handling sampling materials and equipment.

The above support must be provided three days a week on a variable schedule.  The provider must be available to take part in a field trip on short notice and to change plans quickly as required by the weather or other variables that affect sampling.

<SUBJECT>Z -- Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source Procurement
<DESC>Notice of Intent to award Sole Source Procurement.  

The Government intends to issue a sole source purchase order for Drainage way clearance and maintenance to PAPIO-MISSOURI RIVER NATURAL RESOURCES DISTRICT (NRD), 8901 S 154TH ST STE A, OMAHA, NE 68138-3621.  The acquisition of operating, maintaining, and repairing of the drainage way service is necessary to reduce the prospective damage to the City of Bellevue and Offutt AFB due to flooding.  The 55th Contracting Squadron intends to award a purchase order by other than full and open competition in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.

A determination not to compete this proposed procurement was made because there is a memorandum of agreement that was signed in June 1996, between the Offutt Air Force Base, the City of Bellevue, Nebraska, and the Papio-Missouri River Natural Resources District (NRD).  This agreement states that the City would be responsible for the design and engineering of a project for an extension of the existing enclosed storm sewer at the northern end of the Bellevue/Offutt Drain, together with enlargement of channel capacity downstream thereof, and installation of enlarged culverts along such drainage way.  After completion of construction project, the NRD shall be responsible for operating, maintaining, and repairing the open channel portions of the project with the Base and the City sharing the cost.  This agreement is in effect for a 5 year initial term and 4 (5-year) options.  The base is intending on exercising the 2nd option year of this agreement pending the availability of funds Far 53.232-19 and Far 53.232-20.  The procurement for the operating, maintaining, and repairing of the drainage way service must be completed in a timely manner.

<SUBJECT>B -- NATO Request for Presentations by Manufacturers of Deployable Passive Sensors for Allocation to the Deployable Air Command and Control System (ACCS) Program
<DESC>The NATO Air Command and Control Management Agency (NACMA) has been requested by Allied Command Transformation to assist in the preparation of a Capability Package (CP) on Deployable Ground Based Sensors for Air C2 Surveillance and Identification.  

In order to acquire factual elements useful for the CP preparation, NACMA is offering the opportunity for sensors manufactures to present their current products to establish the available state of the art.  

This fact-finding mission is intended only to support the production of the CP, which will be developed without prejudice to any subsequent procurement process to be decided at the proper time.

The planning and NATO CP production activity in hand is focused on the urgent requirement to provide NATO with Deployable Early Warning/Longer Range Air Defense Radars, and Deployable Passive Sensors with similar and complementary surveillance capabilities, for allocation to the Deployable ACCS Component. 

To aid this planning activity, and given that it supports an urgent requirement, the fact finding to establish current product lines and the state of the art will have a particular interest in what is proved and available in the market now, with little or no development, and, broadly, the capabilities, procurement times, deployability and environmental parameters of representative sensors. 

So as to maintain the necessary progress in the CP generation,
NACMA hopes to complete this preliminary fact finding within the next 2 months.
 
If a sensors manufacturer wishes to make a presentation, the firm should contact the NATO official below to arrange a suitable date and time:

<SUBJECT>A -- OPPORTUNITY FOR CLINICAL TRIAL AGREEMENT (CTA): Clinical trials of Saw Palmetto for Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy
<DESC>INTRODUCTION: 
NIDDK, NCCAM, and ODS will evaluate in a phase I / II trial, and potentially develop via a phase III trial, Saw Palmetto for Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy (BPH). NCCAM will file an IND with the FDA for this purpose.

SUMMARY: 
The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), the National Institute of Diabetes and  Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) , and the Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS)  of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), U.S Department of Health and Human Services, is seeking proposals in the form of capability statements from companies for a Clinical Trial Agreement (CTA) to provide Saw Palmetto to support the NIH’s Saw Palmetto clinical trials program. The saw palmetto product must be presently available in the United States.

The initial part of the Saw Palmetto clinical trials program consists of a phase 1 / 2 dose-ranging study.  The protocol for the phase I / II clinical trial has been written by a Saw Palmetto Steering Committee (SC) consisting of an Invited Chair, Principal Investigators from 11 clinical centers, and the Principal Investigator of the Data Coordinating Center. 
The protocol and SC membership are attached. The protocol is designed as a dose-escalation study for the active (and placebo) groups. Because the Product has not yet been chosen, the present protocol cannot include exact doses. The intent, however, is that the initial dose will be the customary dose; the final dose will be the maximum amount of product that can feasibly be administered for a period of months; the middle dose will be between the initial dose and the final dose. It is likely that these doses will be 1 pill (initial dose), 2 pills (middle dose), 3 pills (final dose).
It is possible that other protocol particulars might need to be modified to be in conformity with Product characteristics. However, NIH foresees that only minor protocol alterations will be necessary after the Product has been chosen. 

If the data from the phase 1 / 2 trials suggests that proceeding to phase 3 is appropriate,  NIH, SC, and Product Supplier/Collaborator will together plan a phase 3 pivotal trial. 


Pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (FTTA, 15 U.S.C. 3710; and
Executive Order 12591 of April 10, 1987, as amended by the National Technology Transfer and
Advancement Act of 1995), the National Center For Complementary and Alternative Medicine  of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the Public Health Service (PHS) of the
Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) seeks a Clinical Trial Agreement (CTA) with a suitable company to provide Saw Palmetto to support these clinical studies for benign prostatic hypertrophy. 

The potential Collaborator’s capability statement should provide proof of A) product quality, B) non-clinical safety and efficacy, C) clinical safety and efficacy, D) ability to meet regulatory requirements, and E) ability to provide product for the phase I / II trial and potentially the phase III trial. More detailed criteria that the Collaborator’s capability statement should address are listed under “capability statement” at the end of this document. Collaborator will be a non-voting member of the Saw Palmetto Steering Committee.


DATES: Only written CTA capability statements received by the NCCAM on or before
Aug 1, 2006 will be considered. The capability statements will be reviewed by a Scientific Review Panel. Applicants meeting the criteria as set forth in this announcement may be invited at the Applicants’ own expense to discuss with the NCCAM further aspects of product dossier at a date to be determined. 

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND QUESTIONS: Capability statements should be
submitted to Charlotte McGuinness, Technology Transfer Specialist, Technology Transfer Branch, National Cancer Institute, 6120 Executive Blvd. Suite 450, Rockville, MD 20852; tel: 301-496-0477, email: mcguinnc@mail.nih.gov. 
	For technical questions, please contact Jonathan (Josh) Berman MD PhD,  Director, Office of Clinical and Regulatory Affairs, National Center For Complementary and Alternative Medicine, National Institutes of Health,  6707 Democracy Blvd, Suite 401, Bethesda MD 20892 USA,  Tel: 301-594-7105, Email:      Bermanjo@mail.nih.gov. 

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A CTA is an agreement designed to enable certain
collaborations between Government laboratories and non-Government laboratories. It is not a
grant, and is not a contract for the procurement of goods/services. The NCCAM is prohibited from transferring funds to a CTA collaborator. Under a CTA, NCCAM can contribute facilities,
staff, materials, and expertise to the effort. The collaborator typically contributes facilities, staff,
materials, and expertise to the collaboration. Typically, the data generated as a result of this collaboration is the property of the Government laboratories, but Collaborator will have right of access to and use of the data for regulatory purposes.



Capability Statements: 
A Selection Committee will utilize the information provided in the “Collaborator Capability Statements” received in response to this announcement to help in its
deliberations. It is the intention of the NCCAM that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to the Selection Committee through their capability statements. 
The Capability Statement must address the following selection criteria:


A. CMC CRITERIA

General:
	The details should be in conformity with FDA’s expert advice with respect to acceptability for a pivotal trial. See for reference: “Botanical Drug Products “ Guidance for Industry CDER, FDA. June 2004.

In particular:

1. Botanical raw material:
	Description, spectroscopic and/or chromatographic fingerprint, material processor, preparation of the raw material, quality control tests and analytical procedures, voucher specimen, certificate of analysis of the raw material, storage conditions

2. Botanical drug substance:
	Description, chemical identification for active constituents and characteristic markers, specifications, manufacturing process, quality control tests, analytical procedures validation, reference standard, batch analysis, container, stability, container label

3. Botanical drug product:
               Description, acceptance specifications, manufacturing process, quality control tests, validation reports of analytical procedures, batch analysis, container, stability. 
               Please discuss conformity with ICH Q3C with respect to residual level of solvents, if an ethanolic or hexane extract is being proposed.	

4. Placebo

5. Labeling

6. Environmental assessment or claim of exclusion
 

B. NON-CLINICAL CRITERIA

1. Nonclinical data suggesting safety and efficacy of the product for treating benign prostatic hypertrophy. 
Nonclinical data would normally include: efficacy in vitro and in animal models; toxicity after single and multiple doses in two species; reproductive toxicity in females and in males; mutagenicity/genotoxicity in vitro and in vivo; carcinogenicity data if available; plasma levels of parent compounds and metabolites corresponding to acute and chronic toxicity. 
Because Saw Palmetto will be clinically administered for  more than 1 year  in the phase I/II and eventual phase III studies, chronic toxicity studies (with reversal) should be at least 3 months in duration and if possible 6 months in rodents and 9 months in non-rodents. [ICH M3]
Special pharmacology/toxicology studies, such as cardiovascular toxicity, neurologic toxicity, and toxicity to indicated target organs, would be highly desirable. 

2. Additionally, any available absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion data should be submitted.  
	 
C. CLINICAL DATA

1.  Clinical data suggesting safety and efficacy of the product for treating or preventing the progression of  benign prostatic hypertrophy.         

2. Additionally, any available human absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion data, in normal or compromised populations, should be submitted.  Drug-drug interaction studies are highly desirable.

3. Instructions for use.

D. REGULATORY DATA

1. A copy of an Investigator Brochure for the product.

2. A list of the countries where your product is in clinical testing or has been approved or marketed, if appropriate.

E1. ABILITY TO SUPPLY PRODUCT FOR PHASE 1 / 2 IND STUDIES

1. The manufacturer must be able to supply sufficient quantity of the formulated Saw Palmetto and matching placebo(s) within proposed specifications for the duration of the clinical trial. 
	For this initial inquiry, manufacturers should assume that in phase 1 / 2 trials, there will be a total of approximately 400 patients receiving Saw Palmetto  or matching placebo daily for up to 18 months, and the daily dose will range from approximately 1 pill a day to approximately 3 pills a day. 

2. Manufacturing capacity (batch size) for the product.

3. Please indicate when the appropriately packaged final formulation of Saw Palmetto could be made available to the NIH for use in clinical studies. 

4. To indicate the reliability of product supply, please delineate the business relationship between ingredient supplier and clinical product manufacturer.

<SUBJECT>D -- Global Transportation Network (GTN)
<DESC>The HQ AMC Contracting Flight intends to extend the Global Transportation Network (GTN) contract with Lockheed Martin Integrated Systems & Solutions, 9500 Godwin Drive, Manassas, VA, to provide continued GTN operational support.  The GTN operational system provides United States Transportation Command Intransit Visibility capability of passenger, cargo and supplies moving through the Defense Transportation System.  The contractor is to provide all necessary personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision and other items and services necessary to perform functions of system maintenance and operational support that include identification, analysis and repair of software deficiencies in contractor developed software and integrated COTS products, configuration control, system administration, system operation, database management, help desk support, outreach support, and implement a data warehouse solution.  The resultant contract extension will be cost plus award fee for up to an additional twenty-six months.  The first 12-month option period of performance is 1 September 2006 through 31 August 2007.  The second 12-month option period of performance is 1 September 2007 through 31 August 2008.  The third 2-month option period of performance is 1 September 2008 through 31 October 2008 to support contractor site close out related activities.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541511.  This requirement is sole source pursuant to the authority 10 U.S.C.2304 (c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, due to unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements and duplication of costs.  The GTN replacement system termed GTN for the 21st Century (GTN 21), experienced technical problems due in part to changing requirements.  As a result, the government elected to discontinue the production of GTN 21 that drives the need to continue GTN as an operational system.  The government is currently in the early planning stage to determine future requirements and acquisition strategy.  All questions and comments should be addressed to Mr. Don Tucker, Contracting Officer, at (618) 229-5004, don.tucker@ustranscom.mil.  Verbal questions/requests will not be acted upon.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.

Part of the emergency response capabilities, is the ability to inform the public at large, and to deliver emergency health and life safety information quickly and accurately nationwide from the medical experts within the department, to hospitals, emergency health responders and the public as a whole. In researching a rapidly deployable communications resource for the Department, Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS) systems provided a sufficient quality, as well as a readily available national “stockpile” of systems capable of receiving HHS broadcasts in the event of an emergency.  In order to provide the Department with immediately accessible, full-time national broadcast capabilities, a Public Interest Channel accessible through Satellite Television reaching an audience of several million subscribers is required. The requirement is the leasing of such an above described Channel for use by the Department of Health and Human Services on a public interest-basis.

The government intends to negotiate and award a contract to Echostar, LLC on a sole-source basis utilizing FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 15 procedures. The period of performance will be one twelve (12) month base year from date of award, and four twelve (12) month option periods. The terms and conditions that apply to this acquisition are FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions- Commercial Items (Sept 2005), FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders- Commercial Items (Feb 2006), FAR 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services (Nov 1999) and 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000). THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. All inquiries or responses to this announcement should be addressed in writing to Jonathan Hamlet at jhamlet@psc.gov. A determination by the Government to compete or not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.
