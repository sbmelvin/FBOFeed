<DESC>DESC Bulk Fuels, Overseas Contracting Division (DESC-BFA) is currently considering a solicitation for the acquisition of "Transportation" via tank truck delivery of DESC owned petroleum products from various refineries throughout the country of Pakistan.  Upon loading, the tank trucks transport the petroleum products to the Afghanistan/Pakistan border crossings at Torkham and Chaman and then on to various locations inside Afghanistan.  At this time, the primary delivery locations in Afghanistan are Bagram, Kabul, Jalabad, and Kandahar.  Locations are subject to change based upon customer requirements.  

The primary products and current estimated daily quantities to be delivered to Afghanistan include: Turbine Fuel, Aviation (F34), 200,000 U. S. Gallons (USG) per day; Gasoline, Automotive Unleaded (PAG), 2,400 USG per day; Fuel Oil, Diesel, (PAD) 17,700 USG per day.  A relatively small requirement of Turbine Fuel, Aviation (F34) ranging from 5,000-10,000 USG per week is also required for fuel support in Shamsi, Pakistan. 

DESC encourages all interested companies to submit a detailed response that specifically outlines: 

(1)	The strategic interest of your company to pursue the business of bulk fuels transportation in the Afghanistan and Pakistan region including the required level of management and concepts needed to ensure mission success.

(2)	A management approach to accept the total risk of loss for equipment, fuel (due to theft and hostile activity), and personnel in an active combat zone as part of the contract terms.

(3)	A security plan that affords protection for all fuel shipments and personnel from the loading points in Pakistan to the delivery locations in Afghanistan.  This plan should address areas related to security escorts, force protection, in-transit visibility, and fuel losses due to thefts from unscrupulous drivers and unregulated officials who may demand payments along the delivery routes.
 
(4)	Any recommended contract terms desired to facilitate the solicitation process.   This could include but are not limited to the length of contract term, pricing structure,  and desired performance metric, etc.

(5)	The known impacts related to customs, taxes, and laws as it pertains to the transportation of bulk fuels in the Afghanistan and Pakistan region and the challenges presented in overcoming border crossings with no disruptions in delivery schedules.

(6)	The leverage management would apply to resolve truck driver strikes and disputes.

(7)	A description of your company?s truck fleet size and composition along with a staffing plan for truck drivers and estimated truck turn times.
