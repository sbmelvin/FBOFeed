<DESC>DESCRIPTION AND GOALS:  Under the Innovative Space Payloads and Capabilities (INSPACE) Program, DARPA is soliciting proposals for the development and testing of revolutionary technology designed to enable new missions and capabilities in space.  The short-term goal of this effort is to solicit designs for revolutionary spacecraft, payloads and subsystems.  The long-term goal of this effort is to enable innovative missions and capabilities such as, but not limited to:  on-orbit assembly of large space structures and modular spacecraft; spacecraft repositioning for rescue, retirement, or change of service area; migration of space capabilities onto microsatellite-scale buses; establishment of large geosynchronous sensor bases; novel imaging sensor focal plane concepts; novel telescope and optical fabrication designs; novel communications concepts and other revolutionary space capabilities.  The goal is for DARPA to receive designs for DoD space missions that have never been done before.  Because DARPA's mission is to develop and demonstrate imaginative, innovative and often high-risk research ideas offering a significant technological impact for DoD applications, proposed technology must be revolutionary.  TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS:  The proposed technology should be payload technology - for example: lightweight and adaptive optics and deployable optical structures, grasping/manipulating systems, shape determination packages, self assembling systems, and inflatable packages - or complete spacecraft, or spacecraft bus technology like batteries, thrusters, or processors.  The technology should be defined in the context of eventual integration with a spacecraft bus.  The revolutionary mission addressed should be described.   Both classified and unclassified proposals may be submitted.  SCOPE AND FUNDING:  Multiple awards are anticipated from FY 2003 funds.  The Government plans to make $2.4M of FY2003 funds available in total for all funded efforts, but the total of all awards may be less than or more than that amount.  The amount of funds, if any, for efforts or optional work after FY 2003 has not been decided.  Government programmatic flexibility, all offerors should segment their cost proposals as follows: an initial 12-month or shorter effort to explore and validate the concept followed by one or more optional efforts. The total effort including options should not exceed four years.  Successful initial efforts will increase the likelihood that DARPA will make funds available after FY 2003.  The work is to be performed throughout a design phase lasting approximately 12 months.  Successful offerors will be asked to execute designs of their concepts, culminating in a final design report.  The government retains the option to provide additional funding to some, all or none of the designs to move into fabrication.  Therefore, the proposal must include provisions to have the flight qualification plan reviewed by an organization with previous experience developing space-qualified hardware.  OFFERORS:  Teaming is encouraged.  Participation by commercial and academic organizations with no previous practice in spacecraft manufacture is encouraged.  Teaming with and/or review of proposals by organizations with space manufacturing experience assist in assuring that the proposed design is credible for the space environment.  Proposals from other government agencies for joint efforts may also be submitted.  PROPOSAL FORMAT:  All proposals must be in the following page format: single-spaced, not greater than 8.5 by 11 inches, typed single-sided with 1 inch minimum margins, with a font, preferably New Times Roman, size not smaller than 12 point.  The proposal shall be two volumes: 1) Technical and Management and 2) Cost.  Volume 1 - Technical and Management: The title page shall include the following information of the principal investigators: names, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses.  Pages two and three shall be an executive summary.  The remaining proposal shall be divided into two sections.  Section I shall be the technical proposal, limited to twenty-five pages.  It shall describe the proposed system or technology, the revolutionary mission/capability addressed, the technical approach including a schedule, and a test plan.  Section II shall be a summary of offeror's core competence and capabilities, relevant prior work, organizational structure, management plan, and resumes of key individuals.  Volume II - Cost: The cost proposal shall contain a complete cost breakdown per task.  Use of an activity based cost (ABC) system is preferred, but not required.  The Government will not be liable for costs associated with the preparation of proposals in response to this BAA.  The address and point of contact for this response shall be clearly and prominently identified in the proposal.  Within approximately seven (7) business days of receipt, DARPA will acknowledge receipt of the submission and assign a control number that shall be used in all further correspondence regarding the proposal.  EVALUATION CRITERIA:  The following criteria will be applied for the evaluation of the proposals: (1) overall engineering and technical merit  (2) potential contribution and relevance to DoD Space missions (3) offeror's capabilities and related experience, and (4) cost realism.  The criteria are listed in order of significance.  Note:  cost realism will only be significant in proposals that have significantly under or over-estimated the cost to complete their effort.  SCHEDULE:  This BAA solicits both white papers and proposals.  The purpose of a white paper is for the offeror to solicit early feedback as to whether the research proposed will be of interest to DARPA.  It is thus in the submitter's best interest to articulate clearly the innovative concept and the technology development proposed.  The submission of a white paper is optional, but should be used by the offeror to avoid the expense of proposal generation for ideas that have little likelihood of selection within this BAA.  DARPA will endeavor to respond to each white paper within thirty (30) days after its receipt with a recommendation on the likelihood of selection.  Regardless of the DARPA recommendation based on its review of the white paper, an offeror may submit a proposal and that proposal will be reviewed and evaluated.  DARPA will conduct an initial round of proposal receipt, evaluation, selection, and award.  For the initial round of source selection, white papers should be submitted to DARPA at the address identified below not later than 1600 local time, September 30, 2003.

The Government plans to make award decisions for the first round within approximately 65 days after receipt of full proposals.  Final funding determination will be based on best value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, none or portions of the proposals received under this solicitation.  The Government reserves the right to use contracts or other transactions agreements as instruments for funding the proposals selected for award.  Information concerning Other Transactions can be found at URL http://www.darpa.mil/cmo/pages/other_trans.html.  Space-related proposals received under any of the following Broad Agency Announcements (BAA) may be considered under this BAA upon receipt of a written request from proposer Innovative Tactical Technologies (BAA 03-01), SPO Office-wide BAA (BAA 03-14).

Unclassified proposals shall be sent to: DARPA, ATTN: BAA 03-24, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714.  The technical POCs for this offering are Dr. Gary Graham, TTO, ggraham@darpa.mil and Dr. Joseph Guerci, SPO, jguerci@darpa.mil. Offerors intending to include classified information or data as a part of their proposal shall, in advance of providing their proposal, contact Ms. Ana Santiago, (703) 284-7873, ana.santiago@wg.srs.com, for guidance.  Telephone inquiries are strongly discouraged; written inquiries may be sent by e-mail to BAA03-24@darpa.mil.  Any inquiries by the potential bidders after the initial due date of proposals will be posted on the solicitation web site http://www.darpa.mil/DARPA/solicitations.html.  All proprietary material submitted should be clearly marked as such and will be held in strict confidence.  All proposals must reference DARPA BAA 03-24.  Aside from the PIP, no additional information is available.  Requests for the same will be disregarded.  Acceptance of an award under this program shall constitute an acknowledgement that the Government is entitled to unrestricted use of all designs and associated information.  ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST:  Each cost proposal shall contain a section satisfying the requirements of the following: Awards made under this BAA are subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest.  All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract.  All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports and identify the prime contract number.  Affirmations shall be furnished at the time of proposal submission, and the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in FAR 9.501, must be disclosed.  This disclosure shall include a description of the action the offeror has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict.  If the offeror believes that no such conflict exists, then it shall so state in this section.  It is the policy of DARPA to treat all proposals as competitive information, and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation.  Proposals will be evaluated by government technical personnel only.  The Government intends to use SRS Technologies personnel as special resources to assist with the logistics of administering proposal evaluation, and to provide advice on specific technical areas.  Personnel of this contractor are restricted by their contracts from disclosing proposal information for any purpose other than these administrative or advisory tasks.  Contractor personnel are required to sign the Conflict of Interest and Non-Disclosure Agreement.  By submission of its proposal, each offeror agrees that proposal information may be disclosed to those selected contractors for the limited purpose stated above.  Any information not intended for limited release to this contractor must be clearly marked and segregated from other submitted proposal material.  This FedBizOpps notice itself constitutes the Broad Agency Announcement as contemplated by FAR 6.102(d)(2).  No portion of this BAA will be set aside for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable tasks relating to spacecraft innovative technology, however HBCUs and MIs are encouraged to apply.  In cases where evaluation of proposals is substantially equal, preference for award will be given to those proposals that include HBCUs and MIs as participants over those which do not include HBCUs and MIs.  No additional information will be made available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) 03-39 RADIO ISOTOPE MICRO-POWER SOURCES (RIMS); CLOSING DATE: 29 August 2004; ABSTRACTS:  26 September 2003;  FULL PROPOSALS FOR FIRST SELECTIONS: 7 November 2003  POCs: Preston Marshall, DARPA/ATO and Dr. Clark Nguyen, DARPA/MTO; Email: BAA 03-39@darpa.mil, WEB: http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/RIMS/index.htm.  

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA to develop the enabling technologies and system concepts to develop radio isotope-based power sources for use in powering existing and future military systems.  The technologies to be investigated include the augmentation of existing power sources for existing military systems and direct powering of future miniature or MEMS-based electrical and mechanical devices.  It is believed that recent advances in capturing alpha and beta emissions from readily manufactured radio isotopes provide the fundamental technology for developing power sources that can scale to fit numerous applications.  As such, DARPA intends to support fundamental research as well as system development and demonstration in developing radioisotope power sources as well as prototype applications.  Note: This BAA shall remain open for one year from the date of publication in the FedBizOpps. Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the funds that are currently available will be awarded during the first selection phase. To be considered for funding during First Selections, proposals must be received no later than 12:00 pm NOON Local Time on November 7, 2003. Proposers are strongly encouraged to submit a proposal abstract in advance of a full proposal. This procedure is intended to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review.  Proposal abstracts should be submitted not later than 12:00 Noon Local Time, Friday, September 26, 2003 if proposers intend to submit full proposals for the first selections.

EVALUATION CRITERIA: Offerors choosing to respond to this BAA will be evaluated against the following five (5) criteria: 1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit, 2) Contribution to DARPA Mission, 3) Offeror's Capabilities and Related Experience, 4) Approach/Ability to Transition Technology, 5) Cost Realism. Technical factors (Overall Scientific and Technical Merit and Contribution to DARPA Mission) are considered more important than non-technical factors (Offeror's Capabilities and Related Experience, Approach/Ability to Transition Technology, and Cost Realism). In accordance with FAR 35.016(e), the primary basis for selecting proposals for award shall be technical, importance to agency programs, and funds availability. 

The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  

All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities. 

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE: Offerors choosing to respond to this BAA must read the associated Proposer Information Pamphlet available at http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/RIMS/index.htm.   which provides specific information about this BAA, including instructions on how to respond.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences intends to award a sole source purchase order to Translational Genomics Research,  pursuant to 41-U.S.C. 253(c)(1)–Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This is a non-commercial procurement for ongoing studies of the identification of the melanoma susceptibility gene.  This is a collaborative study between the NIH/NHGRI and Translational Genomics Research.  This collaboration involves individuals who have worked on this project for the past six years.  The next step is screening of candidate genes as they are identified using Bioinformatics approaches or oligonucleotide array experiments.  As most of the currently known candidate genes either have been screened or are in the process of screening, immediate efforts would be focused on the identification of new candidate genes. Also, potential tumor suppressors will be identified, and the genes will be screened for mutations in the melanoma patient grid.  Observed changes will be tracked in families for segregation with the disease.  This study is tentatively scheduled for one year.  All responsible sources may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability within 15 days of date of notice to Elaine Shoaf at the above address or e-mail shoaf1@niehs.nih.gov for consideration by the agency.  Response must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet these requirements.  Responses shall also include itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, an order will be placed with Translational Genomics Research.  The NAICS Code/Size is 541690/$6.0M.  This procurement is to be processed using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  For any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Elaine Shoaf via email shoaf1@niehs.nih.gov.*****

<DESC>The Hope Highway Fuel Reduction Project area is located on National Forest land on the Seward Ranger District of the Chugach National Forest, along the Hope Highway & in recreation sites from Mile 0.5 to Mile 5.5 on the Kenai Peninsula.  The project consists of conducting mechanical tree & slash removal & site preparation for natural regeneration work on approximately 120 acres within a 217 acre project area to meet fuel reduction & natural regeneration objectives, construction of four, 50 – 195 foot long temporary road spurs off the Hope Highway to provide access to the project area, closure & site preparation for natural regeneration of the temporary road spurs at the conclusion tree removal operations.

National Forest land in the project area has significant amounts of spruce tree mortality, breakage & blowdown caused by the spruce bark beetle epidemic in southcentral Alaska, with many of the dead spruce trees already jackstrawed on the ground.  The Hope Highway Fuel Reduction Project Area is classifed as being located in a wildland urban interace for the purpose of hazardous fuel reduction because of it’s close proximity to residental structures in the community of Sunrise.  There are no private structures within the fuel reduction unit in this Hope Highway Fuel Reduction Project area. 

The purpose of the project is to have the contractor furnish all labor, equipment, fuel, oil, transportation (mobilization & demobilization) & supplies to perform the following work in the Hope Highway Fuel Reduction Project Area on the Seward Ranger District of the Chugach National Forest:

The contractor will be responsible under this contract to provide necessary equipment to develop four spur roads into fuel reduction unit 1.  Typical spur road access will include entry culvert, gravel fill approximately 18 feet wide for culvert installation, road fabric material over culvert fill with rock on top of fabric & spot rocking of temp roads & landings.  The Forest Service has applied for temporary road construction permits from the Department of Transportation for this purpose.

Culvert removal & mechanical site preparation for natural regeneration of four temporary road spurs with a crawler tractor mounted brush rake and/or ripper at the conclusion of tree removal operations.

Tree Removal in Unit 1 totaling approximately120 acres.  The work in each tree removal unit consists of mechanically felling all live trees marked with yellow paint & all dead & down trees, whole tree yarding of all felled & down trees to landings. All trees will be yarded to landings.  At landings approximately 600,000 bf will be de-limbed, bucked to length & decked seperately to Forest Service specification.  All remaining slash will be decked by contractor for later burning by the Forest Service.

Mechanical site preparation for natural regeneration of fuel reduction Unit 1 with a crawler tractor mounted brush rake or excavator mounted slashbuster at the conclusion of tree removal operations.

The contractor shall, without additional expense to the government, be responsible for obtaining any necessary licenses & permits, complying with federal, state, or municipal code & regulations applicable to the performance of work.

All costs for equipment maintenance and repair, fuel & filters, mobilization & demobilization to & from the project area must be included in the bid price amount for each Bid Item.  Bid quantities (number of acres) for each fuel reduction unit are approximate estimates at the time of receiving bid quotations.  After completion of fuel reduction operations in each unit, the government will complete a field traverse to establish actual treatment acreage.   Contract payments will be based on unit acreage determinations & the acreage unit price identified by the contractor.  The government reserves the right to add additional acreage to the total project operation pending the availability of funds.

Within seven days following contract award, the CONTRACTOR shall provide the government, a performance bond.

<CONTACT>BILL SPIGEL CONTRACT SPECIALIST 9283459595     bill_spigel@nps.gov;
<DESC>Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, the NPS will construct a vehicle barrier along the International Boundary through Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument (ORPI).  The barrier will eventually extend for almost the entire 30 miles along the International Boundary within ORPI.  Re-vegetation activities will require both pre- and post- barrier construction actions.  All re-vegetation activities will be limited to the project areas designated to receive ground and vegetation disturbance unless otherwise noted (e.g. native seed collection). Project includes inventory (survey and GPS location documentation) and data collection for five targeted plant species, plant salvage and storage for native cactus, native seed collection from seven native shrub species, cleaning and storage of seeds, and 6 - 8 inches of topsoil salvage (3.4 acres) from nine of the 14 identified disturbance areas. Salvaged topsoil will be stockpiled for long-term storage (4 - 5 months) in windrows no higher than 3 feet in height. Stockpiles will be placed immediately adjacent to the disturbance area from which it was salvaged and silt fencing will be placed where appropriate around the pile to prevent soil erosion/loss during long-term storage.  Post-construction actions will include ground ripping, topsoil replacement, planting of native shrub seed, re-planting of salvaged cactus within 15 feet of their original location, and invasive plant species monitoring and control.  Invasive plant monitoring and control actions will occur twice per year for four years after the construction is complete.  Most invasive weed control actions will involve hand-grubbing or use of herbicides as appropriately determined and approved by the NPS. Herbicide applications must be made by a state certified and licensed herbicide applicator(s). No herbicide use can occur without prior approval from the NPS.  Site visits may be arranged by contacting Sue Rutman at the Monument, 520-387-7661 ext 7115 or via e-mail at sue_rutman@nps.gov.  Additional Park information can be found at www.nps.gov/orpi.  The Solicitation will be available on or about 09/05/2003.  Vendors are requested to register as vendors and bidders at the following web site http://ideasec.nbc.gov.  This is also the site where the Solicitation documents can be downloaded.  No paper documents will be issued.  The Due date for receipt of proposals in response to this solicitation is 09/17/2003.

This acquisition will comply with the procedures prescribed in Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-76, the Commercial Activities (CA) program.  This A-76 cost comparison study will examine the possibility of converting Government in-house operations to contractor operations.  This solicitation may result in the award of a combination Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) and Indefinite Quantity (IQ) type contract.  This solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 562211 (previously SIC Code 4953).  The applicable size standard is $10.5 million.

If the best value contractor is the successful service provider as a result of the cost comparison, the estimated date of contract award is January 2005 with full performance starting May 2005.  Following the selection of a best value contractor, a cost comparison to determine the feasibility and economy of converting the work currently performed by Government personnel to contract performance will be conducted.  A contract will not be awarded unless the costs of contracting are lower than the costs of continued Government performance by a minimum cost differential of the lesser of 10% of in-house personnel-related costs or $10 million over the performance period.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information (SF1449.rtf) included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, which is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP); proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Proposal for Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) digital elevation data and related products to support NASA's ongoing Earth Science Enterprise research and applications. These data will be used to evaluate natural hazards in the support of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solid Earth and Natural Hazards (SENH) Program. Two equally sized areas are to be mapped in the Cascade Range of Washington State, in the vicinity of the Darrington fault zone and Mount Saint Helens. The two areas to be mapped consist of high-relief, heavily vegetated terrain. Proposal responses that offer approaches for data acquisition, processing, and classification that are well adapted to collection and identification of ground elevations in topographically rugged, vegetated landscapes are desired.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Pursuant to the provisions of FAR 36.601-4(a)(4), this procurement is considered to include mapping services that are not connected to traditionally understood or accepted architectural and engineering activities and therefore shall be procured pursuant to FAR Part 12 and the Simplified Acquisition Procedures set forth in FAR Part 13.5.

The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541370 and 4.0M, respectively.  Questions regarding this acquisition must be submitted in writing (e-mail is preferred) no later than 2 days after the posting date of this notice.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute(NCI), Tobacco Control Research Branch (TCRB), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), plans to enter into a sole source contract with Bioserve Biotechnologies LTD, 1050 West Street, Laurel, MD 20707 for the Genetic Determinants of Smoking Cessation Among Heavy Smoking men:  An Analysis from the Alpha-Tocopherol Beta Carotene Cancer Prevention Study (ATBC). Using the cohort from the ATBC, a logitudinal sample of heavy smoking, a nested case-control study will be conducted to determine the potential role of a number of important candidate genes associated with smoking cessation.  DNA will be compared in 600 cases (individuals who made a quit attempt but did not successfully sustain abstinence) and 600 controls (made a quit attempt and did successfully sustain abstinence).  TCRB hypothesizes that variations in genes associated with the reinforcement effects of nicotine will be predictive of smoking cessation success and failure among those participants who made a quit attempt during the follow up period of the study.  TCRB's objectives of the study are to: 1) identify the prevalence among the ATCB participants of polymorphisms of key genes associated with nocotine metabolisms and the dopamine and opioidergic reward pathways believed to be linked with smoking behavior; 2) assess the association of each of these polymorphisms with success or failure of smoking cessation defined as a dichotomous variable; and 3) investigate whether any of those polymorphisms are predictive of cessation success treated as a continuous variable (e.g. survival analysis).  The Cancer Prevention Studies Branch in the Center for Cancer Research has been coordinating a variety of analyses based on the ATBC study, and will provide the ATBC samples, scientific collaboration, and oversight of the project.  This procurement will be performed in parallel with an ongoing project being conducted within DCEG that is investigating the possible genetic determinants of smoking among a sample from the Prostate Lung Colorectal Ovarian Cancer Prevention Trial (PLCO).  As the study of the PLCO samples is currently underway with assays being developed, a window of opportunity exists for collaboration, sharing of resources, and the promise of presenting the findings to the scientific community in parallel.  Bioserve Biotechnologies, Ltd. is the only source known to the NCI that is equipped to handle the required services due to assays that were developed and that are currently available for use by the NCI.  However, if any interested party believes it can provide the aforementioned services it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statment of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements.  Capability statements msut be received in the contracting office by 1:30 PM EDT, (local Washington, D.C. time) on September 15, 2003.  This procurement will be processed based on FAR 13 simplified acquisition procedures.  If you have any questions please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No Collects calls will be accepted.  The NAICS Code is 621511.

The hydraulic tank shall have a capacity of 32 gallons (121 l) and be equipped with two sight gauges to indirect oil level.  The hydraulic system will be equipped with a 10-micron replaceable filter. Agitation:  A hydraulically driven full sweep vertical agitator with two opposing horizontal paddles with vertical risers attached to the ends shall mix the sealant material.  This feature ensures that material remains in complete suspension and that the hot material stays in the lower area of the tank and does not get splashed or thrown to the upper area of the tank. The agitation system shall be chain driven from the hydraulic motor to the agitator.  The agitator rotater shall rotate in either direction.  For additional safety, the agitator will shut off automatically when the loading hatch is opened. Bi-Directional Variable Speed Pumping Unit:  A hardened steel gear pump is located in the center of the material tank attached to the bottom of the tank.  Pumping of material is controlled by a switch on the hand wand and output is controlled hydraulically.  The pump and agitator drive shaft stands vertically attached to two motors on the top surface of the tank. One motor rotates an axial tube having radial mixing blades at the chamber bottom.  The second motor drives a coaxial shaft running through the tube to the pump.  The design allows the material to be pumped directly from the tank without in-line pressure.  Sealant pumping shall be on demand.  No external plumbing or recirculation back into the tank is needed.  No interior or external valves shall be used in the pumping and sealant delivery system.  The pump shall be capable of delivering sealant at a rate that exceeds the melt rate of the unit.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), Cancer Imaging Program (CIP) plans to procure a ClinArc system with Cedara software from Imaging Archive International, LLC (IAI), 5966 Exeter Circle, Norcross, GA  30071. IAI ClinArc is the archive system that will serve as the back bone for the CIP PACS system through the NCI Center for Bio-Informatics. The experience of IAI networking their ClinArc data archive management system with Cedara is critical for assuring the successful implementation and full functionality of these two products in the CIP PACS system. CIP has verified the functionality of this combined configuration of the ClinArc archive system and Cedara software and the performance of IAI using the Cedara product at a current active clinical site. The Cedara software is a crucial part of the integrated image archive and display system that allows us to download, visualize, manipulate, and return images to the archive system (ClinArc) using the open source architecture and the DICOM standard for image formats which is unique to both the ClinArc Archive and Cedara image display/veiwing software.  The ClinArc archive and the Cedara software have been designed to be compatible and supported by each of the manufacturers. ClinArc is only sold by Image Archive International as it is their proprietary image archive system. The Cedara software is also compatible with all of the other components of our system. Other vendors have software that can manipulate images however it is not open source code ( i.e. is uses proprietary architecture) that will not allow us to take images from numerous sites, investigators, types of imaging devices and easily display and analyze them and retrieve and return them to the ClinArc archive. More importantly there is no guarantee that this software would be compatible and be supported by IAI on the ClinArc archive. This item is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement. This system is being bought in the aggregate and capability statements to just supply the CEDARA will not be accepted.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on September 9, 2003.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.  NAICS 334611

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Background:  Findings are often disseminated by publishing in a variety of outlets such as academic journals, applied economic journals, ERS technical bulletins, ERS agricultural economic reports, etc.  ERS does not give out or publish the actual (raw) data, only results from models or statistical tabulations.

ERS occasionally enters into cooperative agreements and memorandums of understanding with academics at Universities to assist with research priorities and implementation of economic analysis.  The work may require access to the data.  In addition, ERS conducts staff analyses for internal use.  Internal staff analyses are conducted for the Administration, Congress, or the Department of Agriculture.

Objectives:   a) determine the types of foods that U.S. Households purchase by demographic segment with specific focus on low-income households and how they differ from other demographic groups.  b) identify what price households pay for foods purchased and how household demographics, including income, affect prices paid and quantities purchased. c) assess how food assistance-eligible households differ in the food choices they make and the prices that they pay for food. d) identify differences in food prices across markets in the U.S. and analyze the impact the increasing number of alternative retail outlets for food on food prices and accessibility.  e) investigate the effect of different tastes and preferences across households on food demand.  f) measure the impact of consumer food purchasing behavior on food prices, accessibility, services and assortment.  g) compare measures of food purchase behavior to measures of food consumption behavior in the Consumer Expenditure Survey.  h) investigate the impact of the increasing number of value added food products on food marketing firms and agricultural producers.   

Quotes shall include the following information:  The purchase will include 2 to 4 years of data covering the years 1998-2001.

More specifically, we are looking for coverage of all major food categories, including: meats, poultry, fish, dairy, fruits and vegetables and dry grocery.  Sampling and expenditure weights should be included in order to aggregate measures both nationally and per local market for individual food products and aggregated food group.  A complete description of sample design, in addition to sample weights, other relevant data (such as strata and clusters) should be included.  A data description dictionary that provides a full explanation of any abbreviated terms in the data and a listing of all the available common characteristics for categories within each department.

<DESC>The purpose of Amendment 1 to DTCG23-03-Q-OPD03 is to provide question and answers to all potential offerors and to change the total evaluated price methodology. Questions and answers are as follows; 1Q: Are there any specifications for the size and or number of He-3 tubes? 1A: The requirement is that all items must fit into the backpack.  There is no specific size or number of He-3 tubes. 2Q: Is an alternative neutron detection technology acceptable? 2A: 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items. Paragraph (e) Multiple offers clearly states ,“Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.”
3Q:  What are the sensitivity requirements for the neutron and gamma rays sensors? 3A:  There is no stated sensitivity requirement.  Sensitivity performance is related to unshielded detection (alerts) as a function of distance. 4Q:  Is there a size specification for the CsI detector? 4A: No. 5Q:  Is CsINa or CsITl preferred by the end user? 5A:  No preference. 6Q:  Is there a resolution specification for the CsI gamma detector? 6A:  No.  The intended use of the backpack is a threshold instruments not analytical instrument. 7Q:  Is the weight or the battery life more important in the assessment? 7A:  The weight is important and the operational capacity is important.  Since it can take 40 continuous hours or more to search a vessel, the backpack must have an operational capacity of 40 continuous hours. 8Q:  Is 40 hour battery life an absolute requirement or desired?
8A:  See answer 7A.  The total evaluated price is changed as follows:  The estimated annual requirement is 19 each  per year for an estimated total of 95.  The total evaluated price will be calculated by multiplying the estimated annual requirement per year and summing the five years.  All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.

<DESC>This solicitation will be changed from a Constructon contract to a Service Contract.  Date due extended to 16 May 03.  Solicitation available FBO 17 April 03.

The Hope Highway Fuel Reduction Project area is located on National Forest land on the Seward Ranger District of the Chugach National Forest, along the Hope Highway & in recreation sites from Mile 0.5 to Mile 5.5 on the Kenai Peninsula.  The project consists of conducting mechanical tree & slash removal & site preparation for natural regeneration work on approximately 120 acres within a 217 acre project area to meet fuel reduction & natural regeneration objectives, construction of four, 50 – 195 foot long temporary road spurs off the Hope Highway to provide access to the project area, closure & site preparation for natural regeneration of the temporary road spurs at the conclusion tree removal operations.

National Forest land in the project area has significant amounts of spruce tree mortality, breakage & blowdown caused by the spruce bark beetle epidemic in southcentral Alaska, with many of the dead spruce trees already jackstrawed on the ground.  The Hope Highway Fuel Reduction Project Area is classifed as being located in a wildland urban interace for the purpose of hazardous fuel reduction because of it’s close proximity to residental structures in the community of Sunrise.  There are no private structures within the fuel reduction unit in this Hope Highway Fuel Reduction Project area. 

The purpose of the project is to have the contractor furnish all labor, equipment, fuel, oil, transportation (mobilization & demobilization) & supplies to perform the following work in the Hope Highway Fuel Reduction Project Area on the Seward Ranger District of the Chugach National Forest:

The contractor will be responsible under this contract to provide necessary equipment to develop four spur roads into fuel reduction unit 1.  Typical spur road access will include entry culvert, gravel fill approximately 18 feet wide for culvert installation, road fabric material over culvert fill with rock on top of fabric & spot rocking of temp roads & landings.  The Forest Service has applied for temporary road construction permits from the Department of Transportation for this purpose.

Culvert removal & mechanical site preparation for natural regeneration of four temporary road spurs with a crawler tractor mounted brush rake and/or ripper at the conclusion of tree removal operations.

Tree Removal in Unit 1 totaling approximately120 acres.  The work in each tree removal unit consists of mechanically felling all live trees marked with yellow paint & all dead & down trees, whole tree yarding of all felled & down trees to landings. All trees will be yarded to landings.  At landings approximately 600,000 bf will be de-limbed, bucked to length & decked seperately to Forest Service specification.  All remaining slash will be decked by contractor for later burning by the Forest Service.

Mechanical site preparation for natural regeneration of fuel reduction Unit 1 with a crawler tractor mounted brush rake or excavator mounted slashbuster at the conclusion of tree removal operations.

The contractor shall, without additional expense to the government, be responsible for obtaining any necessary licenses & permits, complying with federal, state, or municipal code & regulations applicable to the performance of work.

Work must be started within 5 days of Notice to Proceed.  Work shall be performed during normal Forest Service business hours, unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer/Purchasing Agent.  All work must be completed by close of business on September 30, 2003.

The government reserves the right to adjust work locations within the project area to meet project needs & the right to add additional acreage or units to the total project operation.  

All costs for equipment maintenance and repair, fuel & filters, mobilization & demobilization to & from the project area must be included in the bid price amount for each Bid Item.  Bid quantities (number of acres) for each fuel reduction unit are approximate estimates at the time of receiving bid quotations.  After completion of fuel reduction operations in each unit, the government will complete a field traverse to establish actual treatment acreage.   Contract payments will be based on unit acreage determinations & the acreage unit price identified by the contractor.  The government reserves the right to add additional acreage to the total project operation pending the availability of funds.

Within seven days following contract award, the CONTRACTOR shall provide the government, a performance bond.  The performance bond may be provided in the form of cash, to be held on security account by the government, or in the form of a deposit account by a financial institution acceptable to the government.

The contractor must have on site at all times appropriate fire fighting equipment for all contractor personnel.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Aircraft Division (NAVAIR AD) intends to issue a firm fixed price modification with SYNESIS7 for the continued effort of digitizing Level IV paper technical manuals through the use of artificial intelligence to eliminate the need of human involvement during the conversion process for Naval Air Technical Data and Engineering Service Command (NATEC).   SYNESIS7 is currently under contract to develop a manufacturing process (artificial intelligent architecture) that combines a variety of software products (artificially intelligent models) and conversion methodologies to generate a Level IV Interactive Electronic Technical Manual (IETM) from paper technical manuals and utilize this process to manufacture Level IV IETMs for multiple aircraft platforms.  The modification will increase the number of paper technical manuals to be converted into Level IV IETMs for the sole purpose of training the artificiallay intelligent models and add expertise in NAVAIR's data type definitions (DTD).  This action will be negotiated on a sole source HUBZone basis with SYNESIS7.  SYNESIS7 is the only known responsible HUBZone source that can provide the required products and services that meet NATEC’s need for an easy to use, time-efficient Level IV technical publications digitization process (See note #22 and 27).

<DESC>The Department of Energy?s (DOE) Savannah River Operations Office (SR) announces the availability of Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) No. DE-RA09-03SR22278 entitled ?Alternatives for Non-Destructive Assay (NDA) Characterization of Large Containers to Allow Shipping in TRUPACT-III Without Resizing and/or Repackaging? expected to be published on or about (September 15, 2003).  The PRDA supports the missions of the Office of Science & Technology (OST) and the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), Office of the Assistant Secretary for Environmental Management (EM), U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The objective of this procurement is to select and demonstrate innovative technologies for alternatives to characterization of large containers (up to 5.5?x5.5?x8.5?) of Transuranic (TRU) waste without opening the containers.  This project will significantly reduce the baseline costs of disposal, eliminating the requirement for costly resizing and/or repackaging. The proposed work for this project is structured into Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III.  In the first phase, the selected contractor(s) will be expected to develop a technical approach, schedule, detailed system design, and a detailed cost estimate for the full-scale NDA unit and for development in Phase II for the Nondestructive Assay (NDA) characterization of large containers to allow shipping transuranic waste (TRU) in TRUPACT-III without resizing and/or repackaging.  One contractor will be selected from the Phase I contractor(s) to proceed into Phase II.  The selected contractor in Phase II will fabricate, install and demonstrate the NDA characterization of large containers as proposed in Phase I in order to allow the certification of the NDA system for the characterization of TRU waste in large containers. Phase III, funded separately by the DOE Carlsbad Field Office (CBFO), will be the actual certification related activities. Phase I will be performed at the contractor?s site. Demonstration of the selected system in Phase II is planned to be performed at the DOE Savannah River Site (SRS), SC. If the SRS Site cannot participate as the demonstration site, the alternate demonstration site will be the DOE Hanford Site. While the contractor will perform Phase I at its site, field visits may be necessary to compliment the work at the contractor?s site. To demonstrate the NDA system at SRS Site in Phase II, the contractor is expected to conform to SRS Site?s requirements. The selected contractor will demonstrate knowledge of the SRS Site Environmental Safety and Health (ES&H) requirements.  All ES&H issues related to hazardous operations are the responsibility of the contractor and will be coordinated with the DOE CBFO/SRS Site personnel. All work at the SRS Site must be approved by the DOE SRS Site personnel, and the appropriate regulatory agencies as may be needed.  This requires careful planning, scheduling, and adherence to all applicable procedures (e.g. health and safety, waste management) and DOE Orders.  Failure to meet these conditions would risk implementation of the project. Phase I _ Evaluating Characterization Techniques/Propose Conceptual Model The goal of Phase I is to model and develop the concept for NDA characterization of TRU waste in large containers that would result in confidence in a full scale system that would best meet the specification requirements. These requirements come from the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) Waste Acceptance Criteria (WAC). Phase I will develop a detailed design and cost estimate for a full-scale system for demonstration in Phase II. The Phase I proposed NDA characterization systems will be evaluated to validate the conceptual model meeting the requirements, therefore performance predictions including detector efficiency, limitations, and container handling provisions are important. Phase II Demonstration to Validate Conceptual Model The goal of Phase II is to demonstrate the characterization technology selected in Phase I and validate the proposed conceptual model.  The objective is to confirm the performance of the NDA system and allow for its certification for the characterization of TRU waste in large containers without resizing and or repackaging. Because this work will be performed on the SRS Site, the contractor will be required to comply with site-standard health and safety and operating procedures.  Among these requirements will be approval of a Work Plan that describes how the work will be done and a Health & Safety Plan.  Close coordination with the CBFO/SRS Site personnel will be expected to ensure compliance with site standards. The key deliverables at the end of this project will be comprehensive reports on the measured performance of the NDA system for the characterization of TRU waste in large containers. The deliverables will include: 1) a calibration report, 2) total measurement uncertainty report, 3) software and hardware configuration reports, 4) procedures for operation/calibration/quality assurance, and 5) performance demonstration program or equivalent evaluation. Phase III Certification Phase After successful completion of Phase II, and at the discretion of the Carlsbad office, it is anticipated that the successfully demonstrated NDA system will proceed towards certification. This activity, if pursued, will culminate in a certification audit. It is anticipated that a successfully certified NDA system will be duplicated for use at other DOE sites (e.g.- Hanford, LANL). It is also anticipated that these subsequent deployments will require a maintenance contract, support contract, and operational contract (with minimally three full-time equivalents for system operational support) at each site. Once released the solicitation will be available for downloading from the DOE Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) internet page.  At this internet site you will also be able to register with IIPS, enabling you to submit a proposal.  If you need technical assistance in registering for any other IIPS function, call the IIPS Help Desk at (800) 683-0751 or E-mail the Help Desk personnel at IIPS HelpDesk@e-center.doe.gov. The solicitation will only be available in IIPS; no hard (paper) copies of the solicitation and related documents will be made available.  Small businesses are encouraged to participate. Point of Contact: Angela M. Sistrunk, Contracting Officer, (803) 952-9236, a.sistrunk@srs.gov. All questions are to be submitted through IIPS using the ?Submit Question? feature.

All ES&H issues related to hazardous operations are the responsibility of the contractor and will be coordinated with the DOE CBFO/SRS Site personnel. All work at the SRS Site must be approved by the DOE SRS Site personnel, and the appropriate regulatory agencies as may be needed.  This requires careful planning, scheduling, and adherence to all applicable procedures (e.g. health and safety, waste management) and DOE Orders.  Failure to meet these conditions would risk implementation of the project. Phase I _ Evaluating Characterization Techniques/Propose Conceptual Model The goal of Phase I is to model and develop the concept for NDE characterization of TRU waste in large containers that would result in confidence in a full scale system that would best meet the  specification requirements. These requirements come from the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) Waste Analysis Plan (WAP). Phase I will develop a detailed design and an equipment and operations cost estimate for a full-scale system to be domonstrated in Phase II. The Phase I proposed NDE characterization systems will be evaluated to validate that the conceptual model meets the requirements, therefore performance predictions including resolution, limitations, and container-handling provisions are important. Phase II Demonstration to Validate Conceptual Model The goal of Phase II is to demonstrate the characterization technology selected in Phase I and validate the proposed conceptual model.  The objective is to confirm the performance of the NDE system and allow for its certification for the characterization of TRU waste in large containers without resizing and or repackaging. Because this work will be performed on the SRS Site, the contractor will be required to comply with site-standard health and safety and operating procedures.  Among these requirements will be approval of a Work Plan that describes how the work will be done and a Health & Safety Plan.  Close coordination with the CBFO/SRS Site personnel will be expected to ensure compliance with site standards. The key deliverables at the end of this project will be comprehensive reports on the performance of the NDE system for the characterization of TRU waste in large containers. The deliverables will include: 1) software and hardware configuration reports, 2) procedures for operation/ calibration/quality assurance, and 3) demonstration of acceptable performance. Phase III Certification Phase  After successful completion of Phase II, and at the discretion of the Carlsbad office, it is anticipated that the successfully demonstrated NDE system will proceed towards certification. This activity, if pursued, will culminate in a certification audit. It is anticipated that a successfully certified NDE system will be duplicated for use at other DOE sites (e.g.- Hanford, LANL). It is also anticipated that these subsequent deployments will require a maintenance contract, support contract, and operational contract (with minimally three full-time equivalents for system operational support) at each site. Once released the solicitation will be available for downloading from the DOE Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) internet page.  At this internet site you will also be able to register with IIPS, enabling you to submit a proposal.  If you need technical assistance in registering for any other IIPS function, call the IIPS Help Desk at (800) 683-0751 or E-mail the Help Desk personnel at IIPS HelpDesk@e-center.doe.gov. The solicitation will only be available in IIPS; no hard (paper) copies of the solicitation and related documents will be made available.  Small businesses are encouraged to participate.

<DESC>NASA/HQ is hereby conducting market research in its acquisition planning and soliciting information about potential 8(a) sources to support a requirement for the Academy of Program and Project Leadership (APPL), which falls under the auspices of the Training and Development Division, Code FT, in meeting its mission.  NASA is also considering utilizing the Federal Supply Schedules or conducting an open market procurement.   APPL requires technical, programmatic and high performance expertise to support the development and adaptation of broadly accepted program management, systems engineering and scientific practices for NASA organizations and non-NASA customers including teams, projects and programs.  Specifically, this procurement is for the promotion, management, and support of two of APPL's business areas, Career Development and Knowledge Sharing.   Career Development (CD) encompasses all academic and formal development and marks the first level of the integrated solution.  CD includes implementation of developmental activities, support of courses and proactive professional development consulting services.  Also housed in this business area in the Project Management Development Process (PMDP), which over the next three years will evolve into an interactive electronic resource (ePMDP) that catalogues, inventories and manages core Project Management (PM) competencies.  ePMDP will also serve as a portal to all APPL resources, connecting the entire PM community, thereby forming a cohesive "One NASA" human capital force. To increase the flexibility and effectiveness of off-the-shelf developmental resources, CD support will emphasize professional development consulting, tailored to Center needs.	APPL will then be able to offer both the Agency and the Centers expertise in creating, developing, implementing, and evaluating career systems and structures.  This will expand the current focus from the Agency-wide PM career development to all professional development planning at the Center or Organization level. CD support will not only interact with the Knowledge Sharing and Performance Enhancement initiatives, but it will also link with the Science and Engineering Communities and functional offices to collaboratively develop NASA professional development tools. Knowledge Sharing (KS) addresses the bimodal distribution of the PM Community: senior program/project managers and rising project practitioners.  While CD addresses the "generation gap" with traditional developmental activities, KS uses progressive informal knowledge exchange, story-telling. During the next three years, KS will encompass all levels of performance development by incorporating KS activities into each facet of the APPL resources.  The KS Community of Practice will grow within the NASA Community, encouraging project practitioners of all levels to share their stories, knowledge, and experiences.  This will unite the PM Community under one set of ever-evolving Best Practices. The major KS programs, which the successful offeror will initiate, administer and manage, are as follows: 1. Masters Forum of Project Managers: a bi-annual three day conference of NASA "best of the best" project managers, designed to give participants the opportunity to build cross-Center relationships, develop leadership expertise, and participate in a Community of Practice focusing on sharing lessons learned and unique practices.  2. APPL Sharing Knowledge Magazine (ASK) Magazine: the APPL website on-line magazine and hard copy NASA publication, providing a medium for explicit knowledge and creating a knowledge base for present and future NASA project managers. 3. Transfer Wisdom in Action Workshops: one-day workshops based on small group discussions on mini-case studies from the experiences of top NASA Project Managers taken from ASK Magazine.  Participants analyze the applicability of the stories to the challenges of their Center and projects. 4. Leaders as Teachers and Mentors (LT&M): a community of NASA practitioners and retired NASA project managers who share their knowledge, skill and expertise through guest lecturing, teaching, consulting and mentoring. 5. Project Management Shared Experience Program: an annual conference for NASA project managers, engineers, and scientists, as well as senior executives from industry and international agencies.  This conference is an opportunity to gather and share best practices and lessons learned, and reinforces the Agency's goals toward achieving a learning organization.  More information about the APPL program may be found at http://www.nasa.gov/portalsites/appl/home/index.html. Work Location: Work shall be performed at the Contractor's facility and at NASA Headquarters and Field Centers, as needed. Period of Performance and Contract Type: NASA intends to award a single five-year Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA.) Orders will be issued on a time and materials and/or fixed price basis. The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541611 and $6 million, respectively. The DPAS Rating for this procurement is DO-C9. The requirement is not considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product.  A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized as required in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Interested 8(a) offerors having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirement should submit a capability statement of 10 pages or less indicating experience, qualifications and the ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein.  Offerors must also submit a copy of their 8(a)certification letter. Questions should be directed to Nipa Shah. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.   The Government reserves the right to consider an 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.  All responses shall be submitted to Nipa Shah at Nipa.Shah-1@nasa.gov no later than September 12, 2003.

<DESC>The Bureau of Engraving and Printing is seeking qualified sources of supply for performance of a facility risk assessment.  This effort will, for the most part, concern a review of physical property (buildings, roads, perimeters, security access systems) rather than Information Technology assets.  The BEP will not consider awarding separate contracts for the physical infrastructure and IT infrastructure portions of the risk assessment to two separate contractors.  The BEP has identified a GSA-sponsored program entitled "Federal Security Risk Management" and associated FSR Manager software copyrighted by ARA Corporation as one means of meeting this requirement.  The BEP desires further information on other available products before potentially proceeding with a sole source to ARA.  If your firm has participated in such a program and has developed such software for other Federal agencies, please forward this office sufficient information for the BEP to make a judgement as to whether or not to request a demo of another available product from your firm.  Also, the BEP would desire to know whether or not the program services and software product are available under an existing Federal Government IDIQ contract such as MOBIS or a GSA Federal Supply Schedule.  An electronic response to this notice is acceptable; however, please contact this office prior to e-mailing any file larger than 1MB as it could adversely affect the recipient's mailbox capacity.  Point of contact is George Robertson at 202-874-3255, or e-mail george.robertson@bep.treas.gov.  Responses are due by Sept 17, 2003.  If hand-carried, the address for receipt of proposals is the BEP employee entrance on 14th and C Streets, SW, Washington, DC 20228 across the street from the visitor entrance.  Anyone hand-carrying information must be instructed by your firm to call the procurement office at 874-3255 and wait for pickup of a package or envelope.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in 
accordance (IAW) with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included with this notice. This commercial item acquisition is being conducted IAW FAR Part 13.106-2 and 13.5. A written solicitation will not be issued.  This announcement constitutes the Request for Quote (RFQ).  The solicitation number is DTCG23-03-Q-OPD03.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-15 Correction. This RFQ is a Small Business set-aside. The applicable NAICS is 334516 and the small business size standard is 500 employees. The Coast Guard (CG) will issue a single  Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity IDIQ.  The IDIQ contract will be effective for 60 months starting as of the date of award.  The minimum guarantee is $300,000 and the maximum value of the contract is $5,000,000.  The IDIQ will include firm-fixed-prices for  Radiation Detection Back Packs. The CG requirements are as follows.  The sensor must allow USCG personnel to search for and locate concealed sources of radioactive and special nuclear materials that could be used in either a radiological dispersion device (RDD) or an improvised nuclear device (IND).  The device must be designed to allow USCG personnel to quickly detect and locate a radiation threat in an unpredictable natural radiation background.  When gamma rays or neutrons are detected at levels above the natural background the device must quickly alert the operator.  Users should be able to operate the sensor with minimal training and/or experience.  User should be able to pick up the monitor, use it, only replace batteries and not have to worry about maintenance such as calibration or replacement of sensors.   The primary intended use of these detectors is to serve as a means to search large areas, detect and locate sources of radioactive material by USCG personnel while conducting typical USCG missions.  The projected operating environment (POE) includes extremely harsh maritime conditions as well as many different types of vessels including but not limited to cargo (break-bulk, bulk, container, etc.), passenger, fishing, and private recreational vessels.  Environmental conditions also include high noise, high vibration, wide and constantly changing temperature and humidity.  The maritime environment also presents many sources of electro-magnetic interference (EMI) as well as unusual levels of natural background radiation.  In addition to other parameters, the offered detector must be able to minimize false alarms that may be caused by EMI and or unusual natural background.  USCG operations often require climbing; as such the detector must be lightweight and compact.  Any control or display must be configured to provide the operator with easy access while the detector is worn on the operator’s back.  The carrying pack should be padded and ergonomically designed to minimize fatigue of the user.  When worn, the pack must minimize interferences to USCG personnel while maneuvering through a vessel.  CG personnel ranging from highly skilled technical experts to our least experienced, most junior personnel will use this sensor.  The training required to proficiently operate the sensor must be of minimal impact to the CG. Performance Specifications are as follows: 1. Features/Functions:1.1. Detect the presence of thermal neutron radiation and gamma rays at levels above the natural background in large areas,1.2. Detect the presence of gamma rays; 2.  Physical Characteristics: 2.1. Capable of operating in harsh marine environmental conditions, 2.2. Lightweight and compact, minimize interference to USCG personnel movements and agility during the performance of duties, 2.2.1. Desired weight – less than 15 lbs, 2.2.2. Desired dimensions-approximately 15 inches wide, 20 inches tall, 12 inches thickness, 2.3. Waterproof and padded to limit damage and interference from vibration and incidental impacts, 2.4. Power supply – battery, 2.4.1. Battery lifetime – equal to or greater than 40 hours of continuous use, 2.5 Alarms, 2.5.1. The detector must have a minimum of two (2) means of alarm to include visual and audible, 2.5.2. Alarms should be easily seen and heard, even when hearing protection by user and others around them; 3. Sensor: 3.1 Gamma detector – Cesium Iodide scintillator, 3.2 Neutron detector – Helium-3, 3.3 Response time – less than one (1) second, 3.4 Operating temperature range-greater than or equal to 5°F to 120°F, 3.5 Storage temperature range – (greater than or equal to) -10°F to 120°F, 4. Lifespan/Maintenance/Warranty: 4.1 Sensor to function for minimum of two years, 4.2 Zero maintenance other than battery change out, 4.3 Desired warranty is two years 4.4 Warranty coverage should include, but not be limited to defects in parts and/or workmanship and failures occurring during the course on normal and intended use; 5. Training-Vendor must provide instruction and training on the proper use and maintenance of the detector.  Offerors must provide Firm Fixed Unit Price for the Radiation Detection Back Pack. The estimated quantity over the life of the contract is 95 units.  The Government desired delivery is 30 days after receipt of a order (ARO). Required delivery is 90 days ARO. Interested parties may obtain a comprehensive list of anticipated delivery destinations by faxing a request to (202) 267-4019, ATTN: Pamela Bible, or may e-mail a request to pbible@comdt.uscg.mil.  Inspection shall be in accordance with FAR 52.247-34 --F.O.B. Destination.  Packing and packaging shall be in accordance with commercial practice to assure delivery at destination.  Provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors — Commercial, applies to this acquisition. Offerors attention is drawn to (10) past performance.  Contractors should provide past performance information on contracts in which the intended use of the item was in a maritime environment.  Past performance data is limited to three contracts.  Offerors should submit warranty information, as well as appropriate information on the prices at which the same item or similar items have previously been sold, adequate for determining the reasonableness of the price. Quotes may be submitted via email, facsimile or mailed.  If mailed, please include 2 copies of your quote. A comparative evaluation of quotes will be conducted on Technical, Past Performance and Price.  Technical is more important than past performance and price.  Past performance and price are equal in importance.  Total evaluated price will be calculated by multiplying unit prices by the total estimated quantity of 95. Offerors must include a completed copy of provision 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certification-Commercial Items Alt I, with their quote.  Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, is incorporated by reference into the solicitation.

Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, is incorporated by reference into this solicitation.  The following FAR clauses cited in 52.212-5(b) are applicable to this contract: 1;5; 11;12;13;14;15;16;17;18;21;22;24.  The 52-519-6 is incorporated by reference as addenda to 52.212-5. Quotes are due no later than 2:00 p.m. on  August 13, 2003  in Room 5222 at the address listed above.  An electronic version of the synopsis may be requested via email.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. To further this policy, the Commandant has created the position of Solicitation Ombudsman who is empowered to investigate issues raised by prospective offerors and resolve them, where possible, without expensive and time-consuming litigation. Potential offerors who believe that a Coast Guard solicitation is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the offeror should then contract the Coast Guard Solicitation Ombudsman at the following address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3)/2100 Second Street, SW/Washington, DC/20593-000l/Ph: (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential offerors should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and the solicitation closing date.

<DESC>OMBUDSMAN NOTICE

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Utility work will consist of relocating existing electrical, telecommunication, water, sewer, and natural gas facilities where conflicts occur.  Also included will be the installation of a new water main, new telecommunication conduit, and new street light system.  Three hundred feet of existing combined sanitary/storm sewer will also be lined.

Pavement reconstruction includes removing the existing pavement structure on Pennsylvania Avenue and constructing granite pavement and hot synthetic asphalt concrete pavement.  The granite pavement consists of 2-foot by 5-foot pavers on a reinforced Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) base.  The hot synthetic asphalt concrete pavement consists of a clear synthetic binder mixed with an architectural aggregate placed on a reinforced PCC base.  New granite and brick sidewalks will be constructed along the entire length of the Avenue.  The granite sidewalks will consist of 4-foot by 10-foot granite pavers on a reinforced PCC base.

Site security consists of constructing bollards, retractable bollards, and guard booths at the four entrances to the project site.  The guard booths are constructed out of granite, cast iron, and ballistic glazing and include lead coated copper roof, granite floor, under vehicle surveillance systems, geothermal heating and cooling units, stainless steel cabinetry, and other security items.

Site furnishings consist of granite benches and information kiosks.  Landscaping consists of planting Government furnished 5½ inch-6 inch caliper American Elms, excavating and placing structural soils in and around the tree boxes, and planting groundcover.

After analysis of data from the first 10,000 clones (Item 01), additional sequencing in increments of 5,000 clones (Option Item 02) clones may be ordered.  The Contractor shall adhere to the Rights in Data-Special Works clause 52.227-17.  The COR will advise the Contractor and the Contracting Officer if changes are required to the order. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS - 1) PROCEDURE METHOD STATEMENT: The Contractor shall provide a detailed statement on the protocols used for DNA isolation and sequencing; 2) CATALOG REPORT: The Contractor shall provide a detailed (final) report beginning thirty (30) days after receipt of each library.  The report shall include, at a minimum, the following: 1. Number of clones that have been sequenced.  2. Number of ESTs produced. 3. Detailing the average read length for each sequence. 4. Success rate. 5. Percentage of sequences that failed. 6. Balance of clones remaining. 7. Identify problems encountered. GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES - The Government shall provide a Government-owned Normalized cDNA Rainbow Trout Library to the Contractor.  The Library will be shipped to the Contractor by overnight mail on dry ice as frozen stocks of individual clones arrayed in 384-well plates.  The Contractor will receive the library within 30 days after receipt of the purchase order.  The number of clones in the library provided to the Contractor shall not exceed 9,792. The sequence data received from the Contractor will be analyzed at the USDA/ARS. The Government shall retain sole ownership of the data.  The Government will make all EST sequence information available publically by submission to the Genbank dbEST database after analysis is completed but not later than twelve (12) months from the date of award.  The Government shall notify the Contractor after the data has been made available to the public. DESIGNATION OF CONTRACTING OFFICER'S TECHNICAL REPRESENTATIVE - The Contracting Officer shall designate the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) at the time of contract award.  The COTR is responsible for administering the performance of work under this purchase order.  In no event, however, will any understanding, agreement, modification, change order, or other matter deviating from the terms of this purchase order be effective or binding upon the Government unless formalized by proper contractual documents executed by the Contracting Officer prior to completion of the purchase order.  The Contracting Officer should be informed as soon as possible of any actions or inactions by the Contractor or the Government which will change the required delivery or completion times stated in the purchase order so that the contract may be modified accordingly.  (This does not apply to individual task assignments which were issued by the COTR; provided they do not affect the delivery schedule or performance period stated in the purchase order.)  On all matters that pertain to the purchase order terms, the Contractor must communicate with the Contracting Officer.  Whenever, in the opinion of the Contractor, the COTR requests efforts outside the scope of the purchase order, the Contractor should so advise the COTR.  If the COTR persists and there still exists a disagreement as to proper contractual coverage, the Contractor should notify the Contracting Officer immediately, preferably in writing if time permits.  Proceeding with work without the proper contractual coverage could result in nonpayment or necessitate submittal of a purchase order claim.
DELIVERABLES - The Contractor shall provide the number of clones required to perform the work identified in the purchase order to the COR within two weeks of receipt of the purchase order.  The Contractor shall provide the sequence data in the form of chromatogram files and FASTA sequence files named in the following format: LibraryName_PlateID_WellPosition_PrimerName.ab1.  Example: 07RT_001_A01_5.ab1 would be from the 07RT library, plate 1, well position A01, 5? sequence.  The name of each chromatogram file is to reflect the clone that was sequenced.  The files are to be placed on RW CDs formatted for Windows 98.  The Contractor shall provide a Catalog Report to accompany each disc.  The reports shall begin monthly upon receipt of the samples and continue through the entire period of this project.  The Contractor shall return the library as it is sequenced.  The Contractor shall provide the above requirements, delivered (F.O.B. Destination), to the address below, within thirty (30) days after the receipt of each library from the Government.  Delivery shall be between the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, excl. Federal holidays to the address below.  Acceptance shall be made at destination.
