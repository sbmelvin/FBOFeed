<DESC>FBO ANNOUNCEMENT: PRESOLICITATION NOTICE
<p>ACTION CODE: &lt;PRESOL&gt;</p>
<p>CLASSIFICATION CODE: 66 - Laboratory Equipment and Supplies</p>
<p>SUBJECT: ASG-2 Bitstream generator</p>
<p>SOLICITATION NUMBER: NB684060-12-05462</p>
<p>RESPONSE DATE: September 14, 2012</p>
<p>CONTACT POINTS: Chris Ganey, Contract Specialist, 301-975-6205<br />Todd Hill, Contracting Officer, 301-975-8802</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Steven Waltman for the purchase of an ASG-2 Bitstream generator under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 13.106 (b)(1): Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>The requirement is based on NIST's need for an ASG-2 Bitstream generator which fulfills a critical need to meet milestones for the integration of quantum voltage standards in NIST voltage measurement services.</p>
<p>This instrument is a further development of a previous design for a custom device specifically designed to drive superconducting Josephson voltage standards, meeting the requirements to the Quantum Voltage Standards Project in NIST Boulder, where it was demonstrated that its performance exceeded the required specifications.</p>
<p>The unique specifications for this procurement, unavailable from any other vendor, include:<br />A data rate exceeding 28 gigabits per second</p>
<p>A pattern length of 32 gigabits for repetition frequencies below 1 Hz;</p>
<p>Output amplitudes up to 2 Volt peak-to-peak that eliminate the need for expensive external amplifiers; <br />A microwave source with continuously adjustable amplitude and phase that eliminates the need for an external microwave synthesizer, high power amplifier, and phase shifter, and meets stability requirements; and a bias compensation arbitrary waveform generator that eliminates the need for external compensation.</p>
<p>The device is custom made to order.</p>
<p>Steve Waltman has no re-sellers. A sole source is recommended to Steve Waltman.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 12:00 p.m. (Eastern) on September 14, 2012. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Christopher.ganey@nist.gov.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<a href="mailto:zbuss@usgs.gov">zbuss@usgs.gov</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Earthquake Science Center, intends to award of a non-competitive procurement to Kinemetrics for multi-channel, strong motion Rock Series Granite recorders. Equipment consisting of seven Kinemetrics Rock Series Granite recorders (Four 36-channel, three 24-channel) to monitor the performance of structures during seismic shaking.  The Western Earthquake Hazards Team (WEHZ) requires this equipment to fulfill a contract between the Veterans Affairs (VA) and the WEHZ to install seismic recorders in VA hospitals that are in seismically high or very high zones. Since the 1960s the USGS has had an ongoing agreement with the Veterans Affairs (VA) to maintain and install strong motion instrumentation at their hospitals and facilities.  Many of their hospitals are in seismically prone areas and indeed have suffered severe shaking from some of the major earthquakes in the San Francisco Bay and Los Angeles areas over the last 30 years.  They are required by law to instrument these facilities so that the ground motion that their buildings are subjected to is known.  Many facilities have sensors already but most sites are not instrumented in a way that the actual building performance can be assessed during a major earthquake.  The VA has a seismic hazard commission and they have recommended that their important hospitals in seismically high and very high zones be fully instrumented in order to properly assess the likelihood of structural damage during shaking from a major earthquake. Many of the areas where the VA has major hospital facilities are identified as having a significant probability of a M6.7 earthquake in the next 30 years. The USGS Earthquake Hazards Team in Menlo Park has contracted with the VA to provide this instrumentation, installation, and maintenance for an initial period of three years. In each building individual sensors are placed around the floors to determine the motion of each floor. Differencing the motion in each floor provides the strain in the columns holding the structure up. The sensors are then wired to a central recorder. Many of the buildings will require 24 or more single channel accelerometers. Each accelerometer is low-noise, low-power, and has stable characteristics over tens of years. The recorders (the subject of this purchase) need to be capable of sampling up to 36 channels simultaneously with a nominal 24 bit ADC.  It needs to be very internet aware, and open source in order for us to integrate the current systems that we are working on. We are building an alarm system that will be installed in each building that monitors the amount of movement that building has undergone (assuming an earthquake has occurred) with respect to design values. The alarm system is an additional piece of software that uses the signals from the installed accelerometers.   The Kinemetrics Rock series recorders offer features that are not available in any other product.  The following is a list and an explanation of why each features or group of features is important. 1.	The highest sample rate available on the Rock Series Granite recorder is 2000 samples per second (sps). This gives a bandwidth to 1000 Hz, which is important for detecting and locating damage in a building. For example if seismic waves travel at 3 km/s in the building then the waves travel 3m in a millisecond. That is about the distance between floors.  To locate damage at a particular floor or between a floor would require sample rates at 1000 sps or greater. Only the Kinemetrics Rock system provides for the high sample rates without compromising sample rate selection in other data channels. 2.	The Rock software that is the operating system for the recorders has numerous unique features that make the Kinemetrics system more flexible and useful in a situation where building performance is being monitored and alarms are being declared.  Such as:	 a)	Multiple data streams. This allows us to have multiple records from a single recorder at different sample rates and with different characteristics such as, i) A fail-safe, locally recorded, permanent record of a triggered strong motion data (e.g., 200 sps)  ii) A ring buffer (e.g., 30 days) of continuous, high-sample rate data (e.g. 2000 sps), grabbed on-demand over the Internet (e.g., for structural research: potentially, one could locate the acoustic emissions from fractures in welds in the steel frame of the building)  iii) A telemetered (e.g., Internet) continuous data stream to the regional seismic networks.  iv) A telemetered (e.g., Internet) state-of-health data stream to the regional seismic networks  v) Similar telemetered data streams to the USGS PI's for the VA project  vi) Similar telemetered data streams to the on-site VA building engineering staff and VA management b)   Synthetic data streams. For the VA project, we want the instrumentation to be able to generate real-time alerts if the building is shaken out-of-plumb during an earthquake.  At a minimum, this will require real-time integration of velocity or acceleration to displacement. The Kinemetrics OASIS software has built-in modules that can generate a velocity data stream from an acceleration data stream, and a displacement data stream from a velocity data stream.  These data streams can be used interchangeably with the sampled data streams (e.g., the A/D data from the accelerometers). The Kinemetrics Rock system allows us to add software which we write to the Rock system to add capabilities to the system.  No other vendor has such capability. c)   Customized and/or off-the-shelf The Kinemetrics Rock-based systems software, Rockhound, is user-programmable and extensible.  Rockhound is based on the modern Java programming language, running on the Linux open-source operating system. Custom modules can be written in Java and integrated into the system.  For example, ISTI has a module to integrate a Rocks system into an Earthworm seismic network.  Custom transfer functions can be programmed to generate any data stream, which can then be used for triggering alarms, for example. For the VA project, we plan to develop a transfer function that will generate the (true/false) out-of-plumb signal for a building, which will cause the immediate notification of the VA building engineers that a structural failure has occurred. d)    Multiple Rockhound systems can operate together.  Modules are available to replicate the data streams from one Rockhound system to another.  Each system can then independently process the data in real-time.  For example, the data stream can be split off to a second Rockhound system that can drive a real-time status display in the building engineer's office, without affecting the other data streams being telemetered, for example, to the regional seismic networks. e) Secure data transmissions. The Department of Interior requires that computers be secure.  Secure data transmission satisfies part of that requirement. Because Rockhound sits on top of Linux, numerous techniques are available to secure data transmissions.  One other vendor currently offers FTP as the method for transferring data over the Internet, which is not a secure protocol.  (Neither the user ID/password authentication transaction or the data transmission are encrypted.) f) Simplified maintenance: The Kinemetrics Rock-based systems can be managed using a standard web browser. g) The Kinemetrics Rock-based systems are very flexible, and can be configured for virtually any combination of data channels (either an actual ground motion signal or a synthetic signal) and data destinations. The Rock OS defines a protocol for retrieving data and state-of- health information remotely as well as a user interface. The NSMP is very familiar with the user interface and significant software was been written based on the Rock protocol to remotely and automatically retrieve SOH and data. We do not have the resources to rewrite this software to talk to another system. Other systems are not similar. This software is our own and cannot be modified by someone else. 3. The channel wiring system for these recorders is completely compatible with the Kinemetrics Episensor that we have about 1000 already procured. It is essential that these recorders work seamlessly with the other devices we already have in order to ensure complete compatibility and communication. The USGS Earthquake Science Center in Menlo Park has contracted with the VA to provide this instrumentation, installation, and maintenance. The project has been funded with a series of one year agreements, but has been ongoing since 2009. We have presently installed granite recorders in about 20 structures of which about 12 are VA hospitals; as well as the Factor Building at UCLA and the Federal Building in San Francisco. The government would incur undue hardship in cost and labor to learn a new system and maintain two different systems. Each vendor has a unique method for communicating with its equipment (browser or ftp, for example), retrieving data, formatting data, and handling state-of-health information. A substantial investment is made in the computer programs that handle all if these processes.  We have made this investment with the Rock-series recorders and the government would incur undue hardship in cost and labor to learn another system and continue to maintain two systems. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROCUREMENT. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the USGS requirement as stated herein may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the Agency (FAR 5.207(c)(16)(i)). All questions or comments regarding this procurement shall be addressed in writing to Zachary Buss, at zbuss@usgs.gov. This notice conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-60, Effective 27 Aug 2012.

Large Pupil             - when looking through a large fully             dilated pupil the optics are separated             and the light source remains in the             upper position, achieving maximum             stereopsis.  Intermediate Pupil - the             viewing optics and light sources are             in a "mid position" for maximum             stereopsis.  Small Pupil - when             looking through a small pupil the             viewing optics and light source are             converged to allow you to view the             retina through the smallest pupils             stereoscopically.

Includes four special plates             for tests to determine the kind and              degree of defect in color vision.

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice only; it is not a request for quotations or offers. 

The VISN 9 Network Contracting Office (NOC 9) is conducting market research for the Tennessee Valley Healthcare System (TVHS) in Nashville, Tennessee to identify potential sources for a contract within the service area (Stewart County, TN) to provide veteran beneficiaries the services of Community-Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs).  It is the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) intention to solicit proposals in accordance with all terms, conditions, provisions, specifications, and schedules of this solicitation and award a contract under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 8153.

TERM OF CONTRACT: The contract is projected to be effective with a base period commencing sometime in 2013 through one year with four, one-year renewal options to be exercised at the discretion of the Government.  


DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS)

The requirement is for Community-Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) for providing Primary Care Services in a private hospital, office or clinic environment to veterans primarily residing in Stewart County and the surrounding counties in Tennessee.  The Parent Facility for this CBOC is the VA Tennessee Valley Healthcare System (TVHS) in Nashville, Tennessee.  Unless otherwise noted, hereafter within this document, singular terms such as CBOC, clinic or Contractors facility shall refer to the Stewart County CBOC.  The Contractor shall provide a community-based outpatient clinic solely dedicated to veterans in one location.  Primary Care services will provide a continuum of care from prevention to diagnosis and treatment, to appropriate referral and follow-up.  Those patients needing specialty or follow-up care shall be referred to VA TVHS.  The CBOC must have the necessary professional medical staff, diagnostic testing and treatment capability, and referral arrangements needed to ensure continuity of health care.  Primary Care services include longitudinal outpatient medical care for the purposes of prevention and detection of disease and subsequent management of medical conditions, for veterans deemed eligible.  The care will be provided by primary care providers who may be general practitioners or general internists or their authorized designees.  The proposed CBOC, at a minimum, shall provide one standard of care that must be consistent, safe and of high quality.  Additionally, the proposed CBOC is expected to comply with all relevant VA policies and procedures, including those related to quality, patient safety and performance.  The CBOC must be poised to respond quickly to VA policy and procedure changes.  If requested or required by either the government or the Contractor, the Contractor will work closely with the Contracting Officer and COTR to modify the contract expeditiously, in order to limit the impact on the clinics veterans and ensure consistency with the care provided by the VAs other Primary Care Clinics.  This care will include: 

(1) Scheduled initial or follow-up visits to primary care providers at the CBOC site. A complete history and physical examination which includes cervical cancer screening for women (including one of the following Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes: 99203-99205; 99213-99215; 99243-99245; 99385-99387; or 99395-99397.) must be performed on the first visit other than in exceptional circumstances.  This is a Vesting CPT Code visit.  Exceptional circumstances means the Veteran is seen for his first visit as an emergency for a shorter duration visit.  In this case, a complete history and physical examination must be completed within 72 hours.  The complete history and physical examination will be performed with documentation of Veteran problems via the on-line Problem List option in the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VISTA)/Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) computer system which will be updated as needed on each subsequent visit.  The Problem List is to be updated by the third visit and all subsequent visits, and include all significant diagnoses, procedures, drug allergies, and medications.  Within twelve (12) months of the last visit, the Veteran must receive a visit which justifies any of the Vesting CPT Codes.

    (2) Point of Care Testing (POC):  The CBOC will provide POC Testing for the following conditions:

        (a) Conditions requiring chronic anticoagulation with warfarin.  All CBOCs will perform POC INR (International Normalized Ratio) testing to allow for real-time adjustment of warfarin dosing.  

        (b) Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1C) testing for patients with diabetes.  Several VA Mission Critical performance targets are based on HbA1C levels in diabetics, including yearly monitoring of HbA1C levels.  This POC testing should be performed at least yearly.

    (3) Office visits to other health care providers including nurses, physician extenders, or dietitians for the purposes of monitoring or preventing disease and providing patients with information and/or skills so they can participate in decision-making and self-care.

    (4) Diagnostic tests ordered by primary care provider or his/her designee as indicated in paragraph 1.b. below. 

    (5)  Phone contacts with patients and primary care providers or their designee.

<DESC>The 96th Test Wing (96 TW/PZIO), Eglin AFB, FL, intends to solicit and award a sole source firm-fixed price contract for a Bluesource Local Oscillator and BlueMax System Power Supply to Star Dynamics Corporation of Hilliard, OH under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). Anticipated award date is no later than 20 September 2012. The Local Oscillator/Power Supply provides essential capabilities to meet mission demands of the Advance MMW Imaging Radar System (AMIRS). The software that runs the AMIRS systems has been programmed to interface with the Star Dynamics Local Oscillator/Power Supply. Since this is a proprietary design, no other Local Oscillator/Power Supply will meet this requirement. Purchasing a Local Oscillator/Power Supply from a different vendor would result in significant costs to the government to modify the current AMIRS hardware and software for compatibility.<br /><br />These items shall be delivered to: 782 TS/RNWI - F1T0EB, EGLIN AFB, FL 32542. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this acquisition is 334515, the small business size standard is 500 employees. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals/quotes. However, the government will consider all responses received within 5 calendar days of publication. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Responses shall be submitted electronically to lesa.whitei@eglin.af.mil.<br />

<DESC>The U.S. Army Operational Test Command, Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate (ABNSOTD) intends to award a sole source Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii) to TREX Enterprises to develop new capabilities in the existing Geometric Automated Video Location System (GAVELS), produce GAVELS hardware and software for the ABNSOTD, and to provide GAVELS sustainment support for all GAVELS systems at ABSOTD and FIRES Test Directorate (FTD). This contract will develop the capability for the existing GAVELS-NVC to track paratroopers.  Upon completion of the development, the upgraded system consisting of eight Data Collection Systems, one Data Reduction System, a Remote Control System and all system software will be delivered to ABNSOTD.   Period of performance for the IDIQ contract is 36 months from date of award.  The system development and production Task Order period of performance will be 12 months after the date of the Task Order award.  Period of performance for the sustainment will be 36 months after the date of the Task Order award via one or more Task Orders.  Total estimated cost for this effort is approximately $2,789,490 for the upgrade development and production, and $299,940 for three (3) years of sustainment of all GAVELS fielded systems.  The minimum expenditure on the contract is estimated to be $2,789,490 and the maximum $3,089,430.  The current GAVELS systems were awarded competitively to TREX under contract W9115U-11-C-0003 and the government requires enhanced systems capabilities to meet mission essential needs.   FTD and ABNSOTD at times share GAVELS assets.  For this reason, it is imperative that the FTD and ABNSOTD systems be compatible.  To accomplish both the required upgrades and the sustainment a vendor would require access to the GAVELS system tracking software code.  This software and its code is proprietary to TREX.  The government does not have licensing or other data rights.  Without this code a vendor cannot accomplish the work required to design, test and install upgrades and perform sustainment work on the GAVEL systems to ensure uniformity of performance and operation.  The NAICS code is 334220 with a size standard of 750. The proposed contract action is for end items for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability by responding to this notice. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The Government will only consider the capability submissions received within fifteen days after date of publication of this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be used only for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  All responsible sources may identify interest and capability by responding to this synopsis.  All respondents must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), and have a valid DUNS number, Cage Code, and Tax Identification Number. All responses must be written and sent via electronic mail to the Government point of contact for this announcement angelic.m.hatcher.civ@mail.mil.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (Brand Name Justification)
<p>In accordance with FAR 11.105 (a) (3), the following brand name justification is hereby provided for public dissemination.</p>
<p>NOTE: This requirement will be competed under the NASA Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) to Groups B and C. All prime vendors under Groups B and C of the NASA SEWP contract will be given a fair opportunity to compete. The NASA SEWP RFQ Number is 144483.</p>
<p>1. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES AND SUPPLIES:</p>
<p>The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), Office of Technology and Information Management (OTIM) has a requirement for the purchase of Dell keyboards and monitors and Hewlett Packard printers use by FHFA employees.</p>
<p>2. STATUTORY AUTHORITY:</p>
<p>FAR 6.302-1 (c) Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, application for brand name descriptions.</p>
<p>3. RATIONALE SUPPORTING USE OF AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE: (Note: A redacted copy of the full Brand Name Justification is attached.)</p>
<p>This requirement is for specific brand name equipment. Although this requirement is brand specific to Dell and Hewlett Packard, multiple distributors are available to quote on a competitive basis under the NASA SEWP multiple award contract vehicles.</p>
<p>Brand Name Justification: FHFA currently uses of Dell keyboards and monitors and Hewlett Packard printers. The current FHFA's IT support staff is trained and has significant experience with these product lines. The incorporation of additional brand names and devices would likely increase FHFA's administrative burden in managing a more diverse IT infrastructure. FHFA will require additional staff to support the multiple brand names within the network environment. FHFA has a limited number of system engineers / server support staff that are trained and have significant experience with Dell and Hewlett Packard equipment. Further, a change in brand name requires establishing new IT standards, images, and standard operating procedures, which would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. Retaining a standard, uniform line of equipment allows FHFA the ability to substitute malfunctioning equipment with identical functioning equipment to avoid issues related to compatibility and functionality. The standardization of equipment also improves FHFA's ability to provide support as it promotes an experience base familiar with supporting these items.</p>

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation, Notice of Intent Number AG-64PP-S-12-BB07. The Midwest Area for the Agricultural Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture, intends to issue an award to Cornell University Bio Tech Lab, 147 Biotechnology Building, DNA Sequencing and Genotyping Lab, Ithaca, NY 14853. This is a sole source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This is a requirement of the Plant Genetics Resources Unit (PGRU) and the <br />Grape Genetics Research Unit (GGRU), USDA, ARS at Geneva, NY for 39 lanes of DNA sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq machine, and the bioinformatics analysis of the resultant data. There is also a requirement for a multiplexed library preparation, DNA sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq machine, and the bioinformatics analysis of the resultant data. The sequencing must be conducted using restriction digested, bar-coded DNA samples using the novel method developed at Cornell University. This method has not yet been made available commercially and is only available through Cornell University. No telephone inquiries will be accepted. Interested parties should submit written (mail or email) responses including prices and technical data sufficient to determine capability to meet the entire requirement and must be received in this office within 10 calendar days after publication of this notice. It should be noted that no contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a comparable source more advantageous to the Government is available. If no affirmative written responses are received, negotiations will be held with Cornell University. This acquisition is being conducted under the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.
<p>SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION:</p>
<p>Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>1. Agency and Contracting Activity (FAR 6.303-2(a)(1)). <br />USDA, AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH SERVICE, Midwest Area, Columbia, MO location, Procurement &amp; Property Section, <br />2. Nature/Description of Action(s) (FAR 6.303-2(a)(2)).<br />a. This contracting action is to purchase multiplexed library preparation with DNA sequencing and 39 lanes of DNA sequencing. Both of these items need to be sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq machine, with a bioinformatics analysis of the resultant data. <br />3. Description of Supplies/Services (FAR 6.303-2(a)(3)).<br />a. This contracting action is to purchase multiplexed library preparation with DNA sequencing and 39 lanes of DNA sequencing. Both of these items need to be sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq machine, with a bioinformatics analysis of the resultant data. Cost is $81,600.<br />4. Identification of Statutory Authority (FAR 6.303-2(a)(4)).<br />10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), FAR Subpart 6.302-1. The services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of services will satisfy the Agency requirements. <br />5. Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications (FAR 6.303-2(a)(5)).<br />a. Only one responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will satisfy Agency Requirements (FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)) <br />(1) FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) states, <br />"When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or for DOD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for." <br />(2) The named vendor is the producer of a proprietary method for sequencing DNA samples. The cost of DNA sequencing has dropped dramatically in just the last few years and new methods that take advantage of this reduced cost in the genotyping of samples by direct sequencing of genomic DNA have become available. A novel method developed at Cornell University by Drs. Sun Schweitzer and Buckler, incorporates a step for genomic complexity reduction (restriction digestion) plus that ligation of molecularly bar-coded samples to effectively sequence 96 samples simultaneously on one flow cell of the Illumina Genome Analyzer. This method has not been made publicly available and is not provided by other laboratories offering DNA sequencing services. Similarly, a bioinformatics pipeline has been established at Cornell University for the processing of the raw data generated through this unique method. Additionally, the research of these two research Units requires the sequencing to be processed through the same vendor as previous experiments so that data results will be consistent and can be comparatively analyzed<br />6. Federal Business Opportunities - FedBizOpps.gov (FBO) Announcement/Potential Sources (FAR 6.303-2(a)(6).<br />a. A Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) synopsis is published in an attempt to identify other possible vendors of the required consumable.<br />b. USDA/ARS does not anticipate other qualified sources; however, should any responses be received, they will be evaluated to determine if they can meet future needs of the Government.<br />7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost (FAR 6.303-2(a)(7).<br />The cost was determined to be fair and reasonable with this sequencing service. However, this cost could not be directly compared to other companies' offers because no other company provides identical sample processing and bioinformatic analysis. <br />8. Description of Market Research (FAR6.303-2 (a)(8).<br />USDA/ARS is constantly surveying the market and from this experience knows that the consumable is proprietary and only available from the vendor identified. <br />9. Any Other Supporting Facts (FAR 6.303-2(a)(9))<br />Due to the proprietary nature of the item needed to perform the research, at this time there is only one source available. <br />10. Listing of Interested Sources (FAR 6.303-2(a)(10).<br />No other sources are available at this time.<br />11. Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition (FAR 6.303(a)(11)).<br />Vendor surveys are done from time to time to see if other existing items can meet the research requirements. Scientists have tested other similar products but no similar results can be guaranteed.<br />12. Technical Requirements and Certifications; (FAR 6.303-1(b) and FAR 6.303-2(b)<br />I certify that the facts and representations under my cognizance which are included in this justification and which form a basis for this justification are complete and accurate.</p>
<p>CONTRACTING OFFICER CERTIFICATION: (FAR 6.303-1(A), 6.303-2(A)(12)<br />I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>

(D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern.
"Registered in the SAM database" means that-
(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database;
(2) The Contractor's CAGE code is in the SAM database; and 
(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record "Active".

(b)(1) The Contractor shall be registered in the SAM database prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.
(2) The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.
(3) If indicated by the Government during performance, registration in an alternate system may be required in lieu of SAM.
 
(c) If the Contractor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. 
(1) A contractor may obtain a DUNS number-
(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or
(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The contractor should indicate that it is a contractor for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(g) (1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-

(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(h) Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.

Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

POC: SSG Shaw, Ametrius 760-380-4472. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>In accordance with DFARS 252.232-7003, "Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports", the contractor shall submit their payment request electronically using the WAWF.

(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

PRICE AND PAST PERFORMANCE ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL, BOTH ARE GREATER THAN DELIVERY <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

   (d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers.

     (1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
 
     (2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--
 
         (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or

         (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
 
       (ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
 
     (3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.
 
     (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
 
     (5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.
 
   (g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.
 
   (h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.

(2) "Confidential commercial or financial information" means any business information (other than trade secrets) which is exempt from the mandatory disclosure requirement of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. Exemptions from mandatory disclosure which may be applicable to business information contained in proposals include exemption (4), which covers "commercial and financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential," and exemption (9), which covers "geological and geophysical information, including maps, concerning wells." (b) If the offeror, or its subcontractor(s), believes that the proposal contains trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552), the cover page of each copy of the proposal shall be marked with the following legend: "The information specifically identified on pages ______ of this proposal constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The offeror requests that this information not be disclosed to the public, except as may be required by law. The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract." (c) The offeror shall also specifically identify trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information on the pages of the proposal on which it appears and shall mark each such page with the following legend: "This page contains trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and which is subject to the legend contained on the cover page of this proposal.

The offeror will also be promptly notified of the request and given an opportunity to provide additional evidence and argument in support of its position, unless administratively unfeasible to do so.

The narrative shall also include the role and participation<br>of each partner.<br><br>Included in this Factor is the requirement to submit price-lists and/or labor<br>rates.<br><br>SUBMISSION AND EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS: The Government will<br>evaluate the Offeror's narrative on the requirements as described herein.<br><br>The Business Type/Classification & Firm information narrative shall describe<br>the Offeror's status as a small business, large business, joint venture, etc. The<br>narrative shall list the CCR registration status (with current date or expiration),<br>DUNS number and Cage Code as well as the NAICS codes as applicable. (A<br>copy of the CCR page can be included as an attachment to this Factor for<br>expedient review but is not required and if included, will not count as to the<br>total page count for this factor.) If the Offeror identifies themselves as a small<br>business, the classification as defined by the SBA - that is, Women Owned,<br>8a, Service Disabled, etc.<br><br>The narrative shall include all information relevant to the firm as to address<br>and primary office location, address of secondary or sub-contractor offices,<br>telephone numbers, size, required certifications for applicable trades, and any<br>other pertinent information directly related to the nature of the firm being<br>submitted - that is, management-oversight, self-performing, etc. More<br>consideration will be given to those Offeror's who are self performing - that is,<br>the primary business function of the firm is relevant to the PWS of this<br>solicitation/synopsis.<br><br>Each firm submitting will be evaluated on a Go/No-Go basis for meeting SBA<br>classification status. Priority consideration will be given to those firms who are<br>classified as Small Business and meet the qualifications as established by the<br>Small Business Administration. Any business not identified by classification in<br>the submittal or identified as a Large Business will receive a No-Go<br>determination.<br><br>The order of precedence for locality consideration is as follows: (1) those firms<br>who are located within a 4-hour radius of Camp Stanley will be given the<br>highest consideration; rated as highly acceptable; (2) firms located outside the<br>4-hour radius but located in the San Antonio regional area and with current<br>and established relationships with local contractors within the 4-hour response<br>window; rated as acceptable; (3) firms located out of state but with current<br>and existing established relationships with local contractors within the 4-hour<br>response window; rated as acceptable; (4) firms located out of state and no<br>apparent current relationships in local area; rated as unacceptable - and as<br>such the entire submittal will be rejected as unacceptable.<br><br>Price lists or labor rates shall be shown for the trades as applicable to this<br>solicitation/synopsis.<br><br><br>FACTOR 2: TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES.<br><br>SUBMISSION AND EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS: The Government will<br>evaluate the Offeror's narrative on proposed capabilities in terms of<br>maintenance and repair considerations and the Offeror's approach to meeting<br>requirements as described in the PWS.<br><br>Discuss, by trades, the approach required for all requirements of work,<br>demonstrating the Offeror's understanding of the PWS. Discussions shall also<br>address the firm's capability to respond and perform repair and maintenance<br>functions, as applicable. Greater consideration will be given to those Offerors<br>who, as a function of their firm, primarily perform the type of work<br>requirements as described in the PWS for the type of BPA being solicited. For<br>example, a solicitation/synopsis for a Plumbing BPA would be directed to<br>firms who do plumbing work as a primary function of their business or<br>plumbing is one of several major operations within the firm. A firm operating<br>as a management oversight or pass thru type operation is less favorable for<br>the intended BPA.<br><br>The Government will evaluate the capabilities submitted to ensure the Offeror<br>has considered all requirements as listed in the PWS, to include response<br>times and primary trade functions of the proposed firm. The Government will<br>give greater consideration on work performed as a primary or self-performing<br>contractor than as a management or oversight firm with respect to the type of<br>BPA being solicited. The order of precedence for consideration is as follows:<br>(1) firm has a primary function as self-performing in the functions of the PWS;<br>rated as highly acceptable; (2) firm performs at least 50% work of the PWS<br>and sub-contracts the rest to one specific firm in performance of the PWS;<br>rated as acceptable; (3) firm is a multi-functional firm that performs at least<br>25% of the work and oversees other contractors in performance of the PWS;<br>rated as acceptable; (4) firm operates completely as a pass-thru or<br>management over-sight firm; rated unacceptable - and as such the entire<br>submittal will be rejected as unacceptable.<br><br><br>FACTOR 3: PAST PERFORMANCE/SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE.<br><br>SUBMISSION AND EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS: Offerors shall be<br>evaluated on their recent, relevant experience with experience similar in size,<br>scope and complexity to the scope of work for this BPA. Past performance<br>refers to the extent and quality of recent, relevant experience, from a<br>subjective perspective. Offerors shall be evaluated on similar type services<br>and/or work completed or in progress in the last five years that are same<br>and/or similar in nature to the BPA requirements being solicited. Offerors shall<br>provide their team's recent, relevant experience with work similar in size,<br>scope and complexity to the requirements in the PWS. Each firm will be rated<br>on its own performance; a firm may not solely establish past performance<br>based on the past performance of a proposed sub-contractor or firm, apart<br>from that of the firm if the firm was acting in an oversight management type<br>function. The Offeror's past performance will be evaluated to determine<br>technical capability to perform the proposed services described in the BPA<br>PWS. The information presented in the Offeror's submittal, together with that<br>from other sources available to the Government (such as CPARS) will<br>comprise the input for evaluation of this factor.<br><br>The Offeror shall provide project information on at least three (3) but no more<br>than five (5) completed or current in-progress service type examples<br>(preferably BPA's or other maintenance service contracts) within the last five<br>(5) years that best represent their experience relevant to the PWS for this<br>BPA. As a minimum, provide the data as specified in the Past Performance<br>Information (PPI) format shown in the following paragraph as part of the<br>narrative submittal. This is a predominate method of evaluating past<br>performance along with any accompanying narrative for that particular<br>example.<br><br>COMPANY PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION (PPI) NARRATIVE<br>MECHANICAL HVAC MAINTENANCE SERVICES CAMP STANLEY, TEXAS<br>Use this suggested format as a guide per each example submitted. (This<br>information along with the Supplemental Narrative shall be a maximum of two<br>(2) pages.)<br>Firm's Name Accomplishing Work<br>Type of Work<br>Location of Work<br>General Scope of Work<br>Role (Prime, Joint Venture, Subcontractor, etc.) and Work Your Company Self<br>-Performed (with % performed):<br>Describe Relevancy to this Requirement<br>Cost (Dollar Value of Effort)<br>Contracting Officer and/or Owner's Point of Contact for Reference<br>Name<br>Company<br>Telephone<br>The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance to determine<br>how relevant it is to the intended services being solicited. Work will be<br>considered relevant to this effort if they are similar in complexity, type, scope,<br>and/or magnitude. More relevant past performance will typically be a stronger<br>predictor of future success and have more influence on the past performance<br>assessment than past performance of lesser relevance. Relevant qualifiers<br>include past governmental service agreements or contracts, experience in line<br>with PWS description, and work in the San Antonio and Camp Stanley<br>area/region. The order of precedence for consideration is as follows: (1) PPI<br>and supplemental narrative with three (3) - five (5) relevant examples to the<br>PWS; rated as highly acceptable; (2) PPI only with three (3) - five (5) relevant<br>examples to the PWS; rated as acceptable; (3) narrative only; rated as<br>marginal; (4) no minimum examples or non-relevant experience will be rated<br>as unacceptable and as such the entire submittal will be rejected as<br>unacceptable.<br>Government type service past performance will be given greater consideration<br>than non-Federal Government past performance. Recent and relevant work in<br>and around Camp Stanley and the San Antonio area will be given greater<br>consideration than other experience in other areas. The Government will<br>consider previous experience at the installation for which these BPA's will<br>cover value added strength.<br><br><br><br>QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN (QASP)<br>BLANKET PURCHASE AGREEMENT<br>FOR<br>MECHANCIAL-HVAC & CONTROLS SERVICES<br> CAMP STANLEY (ARMY)<br> SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS<br><br>22 August 2012<br><br><br><br>1.0 GENERAL<br><br>1.1 Description of Services: This QASP will establish oversight and<br>surveillance for the Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA's) established for<br>Environmental Services per the Performance Work Statement (PWS) shown<br>below for the DDESS schools located at Camp Stanley Army Installation, San<br>Antonio, Texas. This plan sets forth the procedures and guidelines that the<br>Corps of Engineers Southwest Fort Worth (SWF) will use in ensuring the<br>required performance standards or services levels are achieved by the<br>contractor.<br><br>1.1. Work Requiring Surveillance: The Contractors shall, in accordance with<br>the terms and conditions set forth in the awarded BPA IDIQ, and more<br>particularly, in each individually placed call for work, furnish all services,<br>materials, supplies, plant, labor, investigations, studies, superintendence, and<br>travel as necessary for the performance of the work specified herein.<br><br>2.0 PURPOSE<br><br>2.1 The purpose of the QASP is to describe the systematic methods used to<br>monitor performance and to identify the required documentation and the<br>resources to be employed. The QASP provides a means for evaluating<br>whether the contractor is meeting the performance standards identified in the<br>PWS to ensure that the government pays only for the level of services<br>received.<br><br>2.2 This QASP defines the roles and responsibilities of all members of the<br>integrated delivery team (IDT), identifies the performance objectives, defines<br>the methodologies used to monitor and evaluate the contractor's performance,<br>describes quality assurance documentation requirements, and describes the<br>analysis of quality assurance monitoring results.<br><br>3.0 Performance Management Approach<br>3.1 The PWS structures the acquisition around "what" service or quality level<br>is required, as opposed to "how" the contractor should perform the work (i.e.,<br>performance not prescriptive). This QASP will define the performance<br>management approach taken by the COR to monitor and manage the<br>contractor's performance to ensure the expected outcomes or performance<br>objectives communicated in the PWS are achieved. Performance<br>management rests on developing a capability to review and analyze<br>information generated through performance assessment. The ability to make<br>decisions based on the analysis of performance data is the cornerstone of<br>performance management; this analysis yields information that indicates<br>whether expected outcomes for the project are being achieved by the<br>contractor.<br><br>3.2 Performance management represents a significant shift from the more<br>traditional quality assurance (QA) concepts in several ways. Performance<br>management focuses on assessing whether outcomes are being achieved<br>and to what extent. This approach migrates away from scrutiny of compliance<br>with the processes and practices used to achieve the outcome. A<br>performance-based approach enables the contractor to play a large role in<br>how the work is performed, as long as the proposed processes are within the<br>stated constraints. The only exceptions to process reviews are those required<br>by law (federal, state, and local) and compelling business situations, such as<br>safety and health. A "results" focus provides the contractor flexibility to<br>continuously improve and innovate over the course of the BPA as long as the<br>critical outcomes expected are being achieved and/or the desired<br>performance levels are being met.<br><br>4.0 Performance Management Strategy<br><br>4.1 The contractor is responsible for the quality of all work performed. The<br>contractor measures that quality through the contractor's own quality control<br>(QC) program. QC is work output, not workers, and therefore includes all work<br>performed under this BPA regardless of whether the work is performed by<br>contractor employees or by subcontractors. The contractor will engage in<br>performance management to assess and monitor its own performance. The<br>contractor will perform self-inspection for quality, timeliness, responsiveness,<br>customer satisfaction, and other performance requirements.<br><br>4.2 The Government representative(s) will monitor performance to determine<br>how the contractor is performing against industry norms. The contractor will<br>be responsible for making required changes in processes and practices to<br>ensure performance is executed and managed effectively.<br><br>5.0 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES<br><br>5.1 The Contracting Officer (KO). The Contracting Officer (KO) is responsible<br>for monitoring compliance to the terms of the BPA and the individual orders<br>(calls), administration, and cost control and for resolving any differences<br>between the observations documented by the Contracting Officer's<br>Representative (COR) and the contractor. The KO will designate a COR as<br>the Government authority for performance management. The number of<br>additional representatives serving as technical inspectors depends on the<br>complexity of the services measured, as well as the contractor's performance,<br>and must be identified and designated by the KO.<br><br>5.2 The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR is designated<br>in writing by the KO to act as his or her authorized representative to assist in<br>administering the individual orders (calls) issued under this BPA. COR<br>limitations are contained in the written appointment letter. The COR is<br>responsible for technical administration of the project and ensures proper<br>Government surveillance of the contractor's performance. The COR is not<br>empowered to make any contractual commitments or to authorize any<br>contractual changes on the Government's behalf. Any changes that the<br>contractor deems may affect awarded price of an order (call), terms, or<br>conditions shall be referred to the KO for action. The COR will have the<br>responsibility for evaluation of the contractor's work performance. Government<br>surveillance may occur under the inspection of services clause for any service<br>relating to this BPA.<br><br>5.3 Ordering Officers. The Ordering Officer is designated in writing by the KO<br>to act as his or her authorized representative to administer the BPA and the<br>individual orders (calls). The ordering officer will be a designated school<br>official that will maintain a BPA log, BPA call file, and be authorized to place<br>orders (calls) up to the limit established by the KO in writing. The ordering<br>officer may also confirm the satisfactory completion of work and request<br>payment of submitted invoices for completed work.<br><br>6.0 IDENTIFICATION OF REQUIRED PERFORMANCE STANDARDS,<br>QUALITY LEVELS & PAYMENTS<br><br>The required performance standards and/or quality levels are included in the<br>PWS.  If the contractor meets the required service or performance level, it will be<br>paid the amount agreed on in the order (call). Failure to meet the required<br>service or performance level may result in a payment delay or deduction from<br>the requested invoice amount.<br><br>Payment and Corrective Action: Full payment for a BPA order (call) will be<br>provided upon verification of overall acceptable performance by the DDESS<br>BPA COR at the school, as rated on quality, timeliness and cost. This<br>verification will be recorded in a simplified performance evaluation form<br>submitted to the KO and PM rating overall performance with a<br>recommendation for payment. <br><br><br><br><br>6.1 METHODOLOGIES TO MONITOR PERFORMANCE<br><br>6.1.1 Surveillance Techniques. In an effort to minimize the performance<br>management burden, simplified surveillance methods shall be used by the<br>Government to evaluate contractor performance when appropriate. The<br>primary methods of surveillance are: (1) Random monitoring and/or (2) 100%<br>Inspection.<br><br>Since each BPA order (call) is a Firm-Fixed-Price Contract, the Contractor's<br>performance will be evaluated by assessing the milestones and deliverables<br>associated with each individual order (call) according to two standards: quality<br>and timeliness. For each of these performance standards, the COR will assign<br>one of three ratings to the performance: superior, acceptable, or<br>unacceptable.<br><br>6.1.2 Communications. The contractor is expected to establish and maintain<br>professional communication between its employees and customers. The<br>primary objective of this communication is customer satisfaction. Customer<br>satisfaction is the most significant external indicator of the success and<br>effectiveness of all services provided and can be measured through customer<br>complaints. Performance management drives the contractor to be customer<br>focused through initially and internally addressing customer complaints and<br>investigating the issues and/or problems but the customer always has the<br>option to communicate complaints to the COR or KO as opposed to the<br>contractor.<br><br>6.1.3 Customer complaints, to be considered valid, must set forth clearly and<br>in writing the detailed nature of the complaint, must be signed, and must be<br>forwarded to the COR or KO.<br><br>Customer feedback may also be obtained either from the results of formal<br>customer satisfaction surveys or from random customer complaints.<br><br>6.2 Acceptable Quality Levels.<br><br>The acceptable quality levels (AQLs) included in Attachment 2, Performance<br>Requirements Summary Table, for contractor performance are structured to<br>allow the contractor to manage how the work is performed while providing<br>processes for performance shortfalls. <br><br><br><br>6.3 QUALITY ASSURANCE DOCUMENTATION<br><br>6.3.1 Performance Management Feedback Loop. The performance<br>management feedback loop begins with the communication of expected<br>outcomes. Performance standards are expressed in the PWS.<br><br>6.3.2 Monitoring Forms. The Government's surveillance will be annotated. The forms, <br>when completed, will document the Government's assessment of the contractor's <br>performance under the individual orders (calls) to ensure that the required results are<br>being achieved. The form will be maintained in the BPA file at the school.<br><br>6.4 ANALYSIS OF QUALITY ASSURANCE ASSESSMENT<br><br>6.4.1 Determining Performance. Government shall use the monitoring<br>methods cited in paragraph 6.1.1 to determine whether the performance<br>service levels have been met. If the contractor has not met the minimum<br>requirements, a corrective action plan may need to be developed to show how<br>and by what date performance is intended to be brought up to the required<br>levels.<br><br>6.4.2 Reporting<br><br>At the completion of each individual order (call), the COR will prepare a<br>written report for summarizing the overall results of the contractor's<br>performance. This written report, which may be the just the completed quality<br>assurance monitoring form, will become part of the BPA<br>documentation file. It will aid in the yearly required evaluation of the BPA<br>contractor thru the CPARS. The COR must coordinate and communicate with<br>the contractor and the KO to resolve issues and concerns regarding marginal<br>or unacceptable performance and must should be clearly documented.<br>Point of contact is daisy.ciarlariello@usace.army.mil.

All Offeror's shall provide a narrative detailing their small<br>business status as well as the firm's information as requested in this<br>solicitation/synopsis. Firms shall detail their level of self performance for the<br>required work and the level of all sub-contractors. Joint Venture partners<br>should each demonstrate experience commensurate with their roles and<br>explain in the subject narrative how their experience qualifies them for their<br>role for these BPA's. The narrative shall also include the role and participation<br>of each partner.<br><br>Included in this Factor is the requirement to submit price-lists and/or labor<br>rates.<br><br>SUBMISSION AND EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS: The Government will<br>evaluate the Offeror's narrative on the requirements as described herein.<br>The Business Type/Classification & Firm information narrative shall describe<br>the Offeror's status as a small business, large business, joint venture, etc. The<br>narrative shall list the CCR registration status (with current date or expiration),<br>DUNS number and Cage Code as well as the NAICS codes as applicable. (A<br>copy of the CCR page can be included as an attachment to this Factor for<br>expedient review but is not required and if included, will not count as to the<br>total page count for this factor.) If the Offeror identifies themselves as a small<br>business, the classification as defined by the SBA - that is, Women Owned,<br>8a, Service Disabled, etc.<br><br>The narrative shall include all information relevant to the firm as to address<br>and primary office location, address of secondary or sub-contractor offices,<br>telephone numbers, size, required certifications for applicable trades, and any<br>other pertinent information directly related to the nature of the firm being<br>submitted - that is, management-oversight, self-performing, etc. More<br>consideration will be given to those Offeror's who are self performing - that is,<br>the primary business function of the firm is relevant to the PWS of this<br>solicitation/synopsis.<br><br>Each firm submitting will be evaluated on a Go/No-Go basis for meeting SBA<br>classification status. Priority consideration will be given to those firms who are<br>classified as Small Business and meet the qualifications as established by the<br>Small Business Administration. Any business not identified by classification in<br>the submittal or identified as a Large Business will receive a No-Go<br>determination.<br><br>The order of precedence for locality consideration is as follows: (1) those firms<br>who are located within a 4-hour radius of Camp Stanley will be given the<br>highest consideration; rated as highly acceptable; (2) firms located outside the<br>4-hour radius but located in the San Antonio regional area and with current<br>and established relationships with local contractors within the 4-hour response<br>window; rated as acceptable; (3) firms located out of state but with current<br>and existing established relationships with local contractors within the 4-hour<br>response window; rated as acceptable; (4) firms located out of state and no<br>apparent current relationships in local area; rated as unacceptable - and as<br>such the entire submittal will be rejected as unacceptable.<br><br>Price lists or labor rates shall be shown for the trades as applicable to this<br>solicitation/synopsis.<br><br>FACTOR 2: TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES.<br>SUBMISSION AND EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS: The Government will<br>evaluate the Offeror's narrative on proposed capabilities in terms of<br>maintenance and repair considerations and the Offeror's approach to meeting<br>requirements as described in the PWS.<br>Discuss, by trades, the approach required for all requirements of work,<br>demonstrating the Offeror's understanding of the PWS. Discussions shall also<br>address the firm's capability to respond and perform repair and maintenance<br>functions, as applicable. Greater consideration will be given to those Offerors<br>who, as a function of their firm, primarily perform the type of work<br>requirements as described in the PWS for the type of BPA being solicited. For<br>example, a solicitation/synopsis for a Plumbing BPA would be directed to<br>firms who do plumbing work as a primary function of their business or<br>plumbing is one of several major operations within the firm. A firm operating<br>as a management oversight or pass thru type operation is less favorable for<br>the intended BPA.<br><br>The Government will evaluate the capabilities submitted to ensure the Offeror<br>has considered all requirements as listed in the PWS, to include response<br>times and primary trade functions of the proposed firm. The Government will<br>give greater consideration on work performed as a primary or self-performing<br>contractor than as a management or oversight firm with respect to the type of<br>BPA being solicited. The order of precedence for consideration is as follows:<br>(1) firm has a primary function as self-performing in the functions of the PWS;<br>rated as highly acceptable; (2) firm performs at least 50% work of the PWS<br>and sub-contracts the rest to one specific firm in performance of the PWS;<br>rated as acceptable; (3) firm is a multi-functional firm that performs at least<br>25% of the work and oversees other contractors in performance of the PWS;<br>rated as acceptable; (4) firm operates completely as a pass-thru or<br>management over-sight firm; rated unacceptable - and as such the entire<br>submittal will be rejected as unacceptable.<br><br><br>FACTOR 3: PAST PERFORMANCE/SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE.<br><br>SUBMISSION AND EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS: Offerors shall be<br>evaluated on their recent, relevant experience with experience similar in size,<br>scope and complexity to the scope of work for this BPA. Past performance<br>refers to the extent and quality of recent, relevant experience, from a<br>subjective perspective. Offerors shall be evaluated on similar type services<br>and/or work completed or in progress in the last five years that are same<br>and/or similar in nature to the BPA requirements being solicited. Offerors shall<br>provide their team's recent, relevant experience with work similar in size,<br>scope and complexity to the requirements in the PWS. Each firm will be rated<br>on its own performance; a firm may not solely establish past performance<br>based on the past performance of a proposed sub-contractor or firm, apart<br>from that of the firm if the firm was acting in an oversight management type<br>function. The Offeror's past performance will be evaluated to determine<br>technical capability to perform the proposed services described in the BPA<br>PWS. The information presented in the Offeror's submittal, together with that<br>from other sources available to the Government (such as CPARS) will<br>comprise the input for evaluation of this factor.<br><br>The Offeror shall provide project information on at least three (3) but no more<br>than five (5) completed or current in-progress service type examples<br>(preferably BPA's or other maintenance service contracts) within the last five<br><br>(5) years that best represent their experience relevant to the PWS for this<br>BPA. As a minimum, provide the data as specified in the Past Performance<br>Information (PPI) format shown in the following paragraph as part of the<br>narrative submittal. This is a predominate method of evaluating past<br>performance along with any accompanying narrative for that particular<br>example.<br><br><br><br>COMPANY PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION (PPI) NARRATIVE<br>MECHANICAL HVAC MAINTENANCE SERVICES CAMP STANLEY, TEXAS<br>Use this suggested format as a guide per each example submitted. (This<br>information along with the Supplemental Narrative shall be a maximum of two<br>(2) pages.)<br>Firm's Name Accomplishing Work<br>Type of Work<br>Location of Work<br>General Scope of Work<br>Role (Prime, Joint Venture, Subcontractor, etc.) and Work Your Company Self<br>-Performed (with % performed):<br>Describe Relevancy to this Requirement<br>Cost (Dollar Value of Effort)<br>Contracting Officer and/or Owner's Point of Contact for Reference<br>Name<br>Company<br>Telephone<br><br>The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance to determine<br>how relevant it is to the intended services being solicited. Work will be<br>considered relevant to this effort if they are similar in complexity, type, scope,<br>and/or magnitude. More relevant past performance will typically be a stronger<br>predictor of future success and have more influence on the past performance<br>assessment than past performance of lesser relevance. Relevant qualifiers<br>include past governmental service agreements or contracts, experience in line<br>with PWS description, and work in the San Antonio and Camp Stanley<br>area/region. The order of precedence for consideration is as follows: (1) PPI<br>and supplemental narrative with three (3) - five (5) relevant examples to the<br>PWS; rated as highly acceptable; (2) PPI only with three (3) - five (5) relevant<br>examples to the PWS; rated as acceptable; (3) narrative only; rated as<br>marginal; (4) no minimum examples or non-relevant experience will be rated<br>as unacceptable and as such the entire submittal will be rejected as<br>unacceptable.<br><br>Government type service past performance will be given greater consideration<br>than non-Federal Government past performance. Recent and relevant work in<br>and around Camp Stanley and the San Antonio area will be given greater<br>consideration than other experience in other areas. The Government will<br>consider previous experience at the installation for which these BPA's will<br>cover value added strength.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN (QASP)<br>BLANKET PURCHASE AGREEMENT<br>FOR<br>PLUMBING MAINTENANCE SERVICES<br>CAMP STANLEY (ARMY)<br>SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS<br><br>22 August 2012<br><br><br>1.0 GENERAL<br><br>1.1 Description of Services: This QASP will establish oversight and<br>surveillance for the Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA's) established for<br>Environmental Services per the Performance Work Statement (PWS) shown<br>below for the DDESS schools located at Camp Stanley Army Installation, San<br>Antonio, Texas. This plan sets forth the procedures and guidelines that the<br>Corps of Engineers Southwest Fort Worth (SWF) will use in ensuring the<br>required performance standards or services levels are achieved by the<br>contractor.<br><br>1.1. Work Requiring Surveillance: The Contractors shall, in accordance with<br>the terms and conditions set forth in the awarded BPA IDIQ, and more<br>particularly, in each individually placed call for work, furnish all services,<br>materials, supplies, plant, labor, investigations, studies, superintendence, and<br>travel as necessary for the performance of the work specified herein.<br><br>2.0 PURPOSE<br><br>2.1 The purpose of the QASP is to describe the systematic methods used to<br>monitor performance and to identify the required documentation and the<br>resources to be employed. The QASP provides a means for evaluating<br>whether the contractor is meeting the performance standards identified in the<br>PWS to ensure that the government pays only for the level of services<br>received.<br><br>2.2 This QASP defines the roles and responsibilities of all members of the<br>integrated delivery team (IDT), identifies the performance objectives, defines<br>the methodologies used to monitor and evaluate the contractor's performance,<br>describes quality assurance documentation requirements, and describes the<br>analysis of quality assurance monitoring results.<br><br><br><br><br><br>3.0 Performance Management Approach<br><br>3.1 The PWS structures the acquisition around "what" service or quality level<br>is required, as opposed to "how" the contractor should perform the work (i.e.,<br>performance not prescriptive). This QASP will define the performance<br>management approach taken by the COR to monitor and manage the<br>contractor's performance to ensure the expected outcomes or performance<br>objectives communicated in the PWS are achieved. Performance<br>management rests on developing a capability to review and analyze<br>information generated through performance assessment. The ability to make<br>decisions based on the analysis of performance data is the cornerstone of<br>performance management; this analysis yields information that indicates<br>whether expected outcomes for the project are being achieved by the<br>contractor.<br><br>3.2 Performance management represents a significant shift from the more<br>traditional quality assurance (QA) concepts in several ways. Performance<br>management focuses on assessing whether outcomes are being achieved<br>and to what extent. This approach migrates away from scrutiny of compliance<br>with the processes and practices used to achieve the outcome. A<br>performance-based approach enables the contractor to play a large role in<br>how the work is performed, as long as the proposed processes are within the<br>stated constraints. The only exceptions to process reviews are those required<br>by law (federal, state, and local) and compelling business situations, such as<br>safety and health. A "results" focus provides the contractor flexibility to<br>continuously improve and innovate over the course of the BPA as long as the<br>critical outcomes expected are being achieved and/or the desired<br>performance levels are being met.<br><br>4.0 Performance Management Strategy<br><br>4.1 The contractor is responsible for the quality of all work performed. The<br>contractor measures that quality through the contractor's own quality control<br>(QC) program. QC is work output, not workers, and therefore includes all work<br>performed under this BPA regardless of whether the work is performed by<br>contractor employees or by subcontractors. The contractor will engage in<br>performance management to assess and monitor its own performance. The<br>contractor will perform self-inspection for quality, timeliness, responsiveness,<br>customer satisfaction, and other performance requirements.<br>4.2 The Government representative(s) will monitor performance to determine<br>how the contractor is performing against industry norms. The contractor will<br>be responsible for making required changes in processes and practices to<br>ensure performance is executed and managed effectively.<br><br><br><br>5.0 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES<br><br>5.1 The Contracting Officer (KO). The Contracting Officer (KO) is responsible<br>for monitoring compliance to the terms of the BPA and the individual orders<br>(calls), administration, and cost control and for resolving any differences<br>between the observations documented by the Contracting Officer's<br>Representative (COR) and the contractor. The KO will designate a COR as<br>the Government authority for performance management. The number of<br>additional representatives serving as technical inspectors depends on the<br>complexity of the services measured, as well as the contractor's performance,<br>and must be identified and designated by the KO.<br><br>5.2 The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR is designated<br>in writing by the KO to act as his or her authorized representative to assist in<br>administering the individual orders (calls) issued under this BPA. COR<br>limitations are contained in the written appointment letter. The COR is<br>responsible for technical administration of the project and ensures proper<br>Government surveillance of the contractor's performance. The COR is not<br>empowered to make any contractual commitments or to authorize any<br>contractual changes on the Government's behalf. Any changes that the<br>contractor deems may affect awarded price of an order (call), terms, or<br>conditions shall be referred to the KO for action. The COR will have the<br>responsibility for evaluation of the contractor's work performance. Government<br>surveillance may occur under the inspection of services clause for any service<br>relating to this BPA.<br><br>5.3 Ordering Officers. The Ordering Officer is designated in writing by the KO<br>to act as his or her authorized representative to administer the BPA and the<br>individual orders (calls). The ordering officer will be a designated school<br>official that will maintain a BPA log, BPA call file, and be authorized to place<br>orders (calls) up to the limit established by the KO in writing. The ordering<br>officer may also confirm the satisfactory completion of work and request<br>payment of submitted invoices for completed work.<br><br>6.0 IDENTIFICATION OF REQUIRED PERFORMANCE STANDARDS<br>QUALITY LEVELS & PAYMENTS<br><br>The required performance standards and/or quality levels are included in the<br>PWS. If the contractor meets the required service or performance level, it will be<br>paid the amount agreed on in the order (call). Failure to meet the required<br>service or performance level may result in a payment delay or deduction from<br>the requested invoice amount.<br><br>Payment and Corrective Action: Full payment for a BPA order (call) will be<br>provided upon verification of overall acceptable performance by the DDESS<br>BPA COR at the school, as rated on quality, timeliness and cost. This<br>verification will be recorded in a simplified performance evaluation form<br>submitted to the KO and PM rating overall performance with a<br>recommendation for payment.<br><br><br>6.1 METHODOLOGIES TO MONITOR PERFORMANCE<br><br>6.1.1 Surveillance Techniques. In an effort to minimize the performance<br>management burden, simplified surveillance methods shall be used by the<br>Government to evaluate contractor performance when appropriate. The<br>primary methods of surveillance are: (1) Random monitoring and/or (2) 100%<br>Inspection.<br><br>Since each BPA order (call) is a Firm-Fixed-Price Contract, the Contractor's<br>performance will be evaluated by assessing the milestones and deliverables<br>associated with each individual order (call) according to two standards: quality<br>and timeliness. For each of these performance standards, the COR will assign<br>one of three ratings to the performance: superior, acceptable, or<br>unacceptable.<br><br>6.1.2 Communications. The contractor is expected to establish and maintain<br>professional communication between its employees and customers. The<br>primary objective of this communication is customer satisfaction. Customer<br>satisfaction is the most significant external indicator of the success and<br>effectiveness of all services provided and can be measured through customer<br>complaints. Performance management drives the contractor to be customer<br>focused through initially and internally addressing customer complaints and<br>investigating the issues and/or problems but the customer always has the<br>option to communicate complaints to the COR or KO as opposed to the<br>contractor.<br><br>6.1.3 Customer complaints, to be considered valid, must set forth clearly and<br>in writing the detailed nature of the complaint, must be signed, and must be<br>forwarded to the COR or KO.<br><br><br>Customer feedback may also be obtained either from the results of formal<br>customer satisfaction surveys or from random customer complaints.<br><br>6.2 Acceptable Quality Levels.<br><br>The acceptable quality levels (AQLs) included in Attachment 2, Performance<br>Requirements Summary Table, for contractor performance are structured to<br>allow the contractor to manage how the work is performed while providing<br>processes for performance shortfalls.<br><br><br>6.3 QUALITY ASSURANCE DOCUMENTATION<br><br>6.3.1 Performance Management Feedback Loop. The performance<br>management feedback loop begins with the communication of expected<br>outcomes. Performance standards are expressed in the PWS.<br><br>6.3.2 Monitoring Forms. The Government's surveillance will be annotated. The forms,<br>when completed, will document the Government's assessment of the contractor's<br>performance under the individual orders (calls) to ensure that the required results are<br>being achieved. The form will be maintained in the BPA file at the school.<br><br>6.4 ANALYSIS OF QUALITY ASSURANCE ASSESSMENT<br>6.4.1 Determining Performance. Government shall use the monitoring<br>methods cited in paragraph 6.1.1 to determine whether the performance<br>service levels have been met. If the contractor has not met the minimum<br>requirements, a corrective action plan may need to be developed to show how<br>and by what date performance is intended to be brought up to the required<br>levels.<br><br>6.4.2 Reporting<br><br>At the completion of each individual order (call), the COR will prepare a<br>written report for summarizing the overall results of the contractor's<br>performance. This written report, which may be the just the completed quality<br>assurance monitoring form, will become part of the BPA<br>documentation file. It will aid in the yearly required evaluation of the BPA<br>contractor thru the CPARS. The COR must coordinate and communicate with<br>the contractor and the KO to resolve issues and concerns regarding marginal<br>or unacceptable performance and must should be clearly documented.<br>Point of contact is daisy.ciarlariello@usace.army.mil.

This announcement is to solicit interest for the establishment of a BPA and will be the only solicitation/synopsis to be issued for this service. Responses are requested and additional solicitations or synopses will not be issued. In support of the Small Business Association and DoD Congressionally mandated small business goals, this is a Small Business set aside announcement. It is the intention of the Government to award a minimum of three (3) Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) to those firms who demonstrate they are capable of providing services to the Camp Stanley area of operation as identified by the requirements in this document, but the Government reserves the right to make a single award from this solicitation/synopsis. The Government reserves the right to make an award on initial responses received. The Government reserves the right to enter into discussions if necessary. The BPA duration will be for a one-year base period and may be extended in one-year increments not to exceed a total of three-years for the BPA. The establishment of the BPA does not imply any agreement on the part of the Government to place future calls, orders or contracts with the BPA holder. The Government makes no representation as to the number of calls or actual amount of work to be ordered. Interested firms must identify their interest and capability to perform to the requirements set forth in this solicitation/synopsis to be considered for award of the solicited BPAs. The awarded BPA will be an agreement capable of fulfilling the requirements of performance for Camp Stanley and the Army as stated in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) and through-out the complete period of performance as established by the specific award. No calls will exceed the amount of $150,000.  The aggregate amount of the BPA will be approximately $200,000 per year for a maximum $600,000 for the total three-year duration of all options.  ALL QUOTES ARE TO BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT. <br><br>The Government will evaluate all submitted responses in accordance with the submissions and evaluation criteria described herein as part of a Single-Step Solicitation Process.

All vehicles without either a military decal or GSA tags are required to enter Camp Stanley through designated Access Control Point (ACP) for inspection.  <br><br><br><br><br>4 CONTRACTOR FURNISHED ITEMS AND SERVICES. <br><br>4.1 Certificates, Licenses, Training and Permits.  The Contractor shall, at no additional cost to the Government, obtain all certificates, licenses and permits required for performance of BPA services, and for complying with all applicable local, state, and Federal laws, rules and regulations. Contractor shall provide training certificates and authorized factory servicing agreements upon request.<br><br>4.2 Reporting Relationship: Upon arrival at the job site, the service personnel will report to the installation engineering and logistics Facility Manager. The Facility Manager will assist in the access to work sites and identification of priorities as necessary.  <br><br>4.3 Schedule: Contractor shall submit work schedule for government coordination prior to start of service on all BPA calls. <br><br><br><br>FACTOR 1: BUSINESS TYPE/CLASSIFICATION & FIRM INFORMATION.<br><br>GENERAL: It is the objective of this solicitation/synopsis to give priority<br>consideration to those firms who are classified as (1) Small Business per SBA<br>identifications, (2) meet the qualifications as established by the Small<br>Business Administration and (3) preference to firms located in the San<br>Antonio, Texas area. All Offeror's shall provide a narrative detailing their small<br>business status as well as the firm's information as requested in this<br>solicitation/synopsis. Firms shall detail their level of self performance for the<br>required work and the level of all sub-contractors. Joint Venture partners<br>should each demonstrate experience commensurate with their roles and<br>explain in the subject narrative how their experience qualifies them for their<br>role for these BPA's. The narrative shall also include the role and participation<br>of each partner.<br><br>Included in this Factor is the requirement to submit price-lists and/or labor<br>rates.<br><br>SUBMISSION AND EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS: The Government will<br>evaluate the Offeror's narrative on the requirements as described herein.<br><br>The Business Type/Classification & Firm information narrative shall describe<br>the Offeror's status as a small business, large business, joint venture, etc. The<br>narrative shall list the CCR registration status (with current date or expiration),<br><br>DUNS number and Cage Code as well as the NAICS codes as applicable. (A<br>copy of the CCR page can be included as an attachment to this Factor for<br>expedient review but is not required and if included, will not count as to the<br>total page count for this factor.) If the Offeror identifies themselves as a small<br>business, the classification as defined by the SBA - that is, Women Owned,<br>8a, Service Disabled, etc.<br><br>The narrative shall include all information relevant to the firm as to address<br>and primary office location, address of secondary or sub-contractor offices,<br>telephone numbers, size, required certifications for applicable trades, and any<br>other pertinent information directly related to the nature of the firm being<br>submitted - that is, management-oversight, self-performing, etc. More<br>consideration will be given to those Offeror's who are self performing - that is,<br>the primary business function of the firm is relevant to the PWS of this<br>solicitation/synopsis.<br><br>Each firm submitting will be evaluated on a Go/No-Go basis for meeting SBA<br>classification status. Priority consideration will be given to those firms who are<br>classified as Small Business and meet the qualifications as established by the<br>Small Business Administration. Any business not identified by classification in<br>the submittal or identified as a Large Business will receive a No-Go<br>determination.<br><br>The order of precedence for locality consideration is as follows: (1) those firms<br>who are located within a 4-hour radius of Camp Stanley will be given the<br>highest consideration; rated as highly acceptable; (2) firms located outside the<br>4-hour radius but located in the San Antonio regional area and with current<br>and established relationships with local contractors within the 4-hour response<br>window; rated as acceptable; (3) firms located out of state but with current<br>and existing established relationships with local contractors within the 4-hour<br>response window; rated as acceptable; (4) firms located out of state and no<br>apparent current relationships in local area; rated as unacceptable - and as<br>such the entire submittal will be rejected as unacceptable.<br><br>Price lists or labor rates shall be shown for the trades as applicable to this<br>solicitation/synopsis.<br><br>FACTOR 2: TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES.<br><br>SUBMISSION AND EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS: The Government will<br>evaluate the Offeror's narrative on proposed capabilities in terms of<br>maintenance and repair considerations and the Offeror's approach to meeting<br>requirements as described in the PWS.<br><br>Discuss, by trades, the approach required for all requirements of work,<br>demonstrating the Offeror's understanding of the PWS. Discussions shall also<br>address the firm's capability to respond and perform repair and maintenance<br>functions, as applicable. Greater consideration will be given to those Offerors<br>who, as a function of their firm, primarily perform the type of work<br>requirements as described in the PWS for the type of BPA being solicited. For<br>example, a solicitation/synopsis for a Plumbing BPA would be directed to<br>firms who do plumbing work as a primary function of their business or<br>plumbing is one of several major operations within the firm. A firm operating<br>as a management oversight or pass thru type operation is less favorable for<br>the intended BPA.<br><br>The Government will evaluate the capabilities submitted to ensure the Offeror<br>has considered all requirements as listed in the PWS, to include response<br>times and primary trade functions of the proposed firm. The Government will<br>give greater consideration on work performed as a primary or self-performing<br>contractor than as a management or oversight firm with respect to the type of<br>BPA being solicited. The order of precedence for consideration is as follows:<br>(1) firm has a primary function as self-performing in the functions of the PWS;<br>rated as highly acceptable; (2) firm performs at least 50% work of the PWS<br>and sub-contracts the rest to one specific firm in performance of the PWS;<br>rated as acceptable; (3) firm is a multi-functional firm that performs at least<br>25% of the work and oversees other contractors in performance of the PWS;<br>rated as acceptable; (4) firm operates completely as a pass-thru or<br>management over-sight firm; rated unacceptable - and as such the entire<br>submittal will be rejected as unacceptable.<br><br>FACTOR 3: PAST PERFORMANCE/SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE.<br><br>SUBMISSION AND EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS: Offerors shall be<br>evaluated on their recent, relevant experience with experience similar in size,<br>scope and complexity to the scope of work for this BPA. Past performance<br>refers to the extent and quality of recent, relevant experience, from a<br>subjective perspective. Offerors shall be evaluated on similar type services<br>and/or work completed or in progress in the last five years that are same<br>and/or similar in nature to the BPA requirements being solicited. Offerors shall<br>provide their team's recent, relevant experience with work similar in size,<br>scope and complexity to the requirements in the PWS. Each firm will be rated<br>on its own performance; a firm may not solely establish past performance<br>based on the past performance of a proposed sub-contractor or firm, apart<br>from that of the firm if the firm was acting in an oversight management type<br>function. The Offeror's past performance will be evaluated to determine<br>technical capability to perform the proposed services described in the BPA<br>PWS. The information presented in the Offeror's submittal, together with that<br>from other sources available to the Government (such as CPARS) will<br>comprise the input for evaluation of this factor.<br><br>The Offeror shall provide project information on at least three (3) but no more<br>than five (5) completed or current in-progress service type examples<br>(preferably BPA's or other maintenance service contracts) within the last five<br>(5) years that best represent their experience relevant to the PWS for this<br>BPA. As a minimum, provide the data as specified in the Past Performance<br>Information (PPI) format shown in the following paragraph as part of the<br>narrative submittal. This is a predominate method of evaluating past<br>performance along with any accompanying narrative for that particular<br>example.<br><br>COMPANY PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION (PPI) NARRATIVE<br>ROOFING MAINTENANCE SERVICES CAMP STANLEY, TEXAS<br>Use this suggested format as a guide per each example submitted. (This<br>information along with the Supplemental Narrative shall be a maximum of two<br>(2) pages.)<br>Firm's Name Accomplishing Work<br>Type of Work<br>Location of Work<br>General Scope of Work<br>Role (Prime, Joint Venture, Subcontractor, etc.) and Work Your Company Self<br>-Performed (with % performed):<br>Describe Relevancy to this Requirement<br>Cost (Dollar Value of Effort)<br>Contracting Officer and/or Owner's Point of Contact for Reference<br>Name<br>Company<br>Telephone<br>The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance to determine<br>how relevant it is to the intended services being solicited. Work will be<br>considered relevant to this effort if they are similar in complexity, type, scope,<br>and/or magnitude. More relevant past performance will typically be a stronger<br>predictor of future success and have more influence on the past performance<br>assessment than past performance of lesser relevance. Relevant qualifiers<br>include past governmental service agreements or contracts, experience in line<br>with PWS description, and work in the San Antonio and Camp Stanley<br>area/region.<br><br><br>QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN (QASP)<br>BLANKET PURCHASE AGREEMENT<br>FOR<br>ROOFING MAINTENANCE SERVICES<br>CAMP STANLEY (ARMY)<br>SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS<br><br>22 August 2012<br><br>1.0 GENERAL<br><br>1.1 Description of Services: This QASP will establish oversight and<br>surveillance for the Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA's) established for<br>Environmental Services per the Performance Work Statement (PWS) shown<br>below for the DDESS schools located at Camp Stanley Army Installation, San<br>Antonio, Texas. This plan sets forth the procedures and guidelines that the<br>Corps of Engineers Southwest Fort Worth (SWF) will use in ensuring the<br>required performance standards or services levels are achieved by the<br>contractor.<br><br>1.1. Work Requiring Surveillance: The Contractors shall, in accordance with<br>the terms and conditions set forth in the awarded BPA IDIQ, and more<br>particularly, in each individually placed call for work, furnish all services,<br>materials, supplies, plant, labor, investigations, studies, superintendence, and<br>travel as necessary for the performance of the work specified herein.<br><br>2.0 PURPOSE<br><br>2.1 The purpose of the QASP is to describe the systematic methods used to<br>monitor performance and to identify the required documentation and the<br>resources to be employed. The QASP provides a means for evaluating<br>whether the contractor is meeting the performance standards identified in the<br>PWS to ensure that the government pays only for the level of services<br>received.<br><br>2.2 This QASP defines the roles and responsibilities of all members of the<br>integrated delivery team (IDT), identifies the performance objectives, defines<br>the methodologies used to monitor and evaluate the contractor's performance,<br>describes quality assurance documentation requirements, and describes the<br>analysis of quality assurance monitoring results.<br><br>3.0 Performance Management Approach<br><br>3.1 The PWS structures the acquisition around "what" service or quality level<br>is required, as opposed to "how" the contractor should perform the work (i.e.,<br>performance not prescriptive). This QASP will define the performance<br>management approach taken by the COR to monitor and manage the<br>contractor's performance to ensure the expected outcomes or performance<br>objectives communicated in the PWS are achieved. Performance<br>management rests on developing a capability to review and analyze<br>information generated through performance assessment. The ability to make<br>decisions based on the analysis of performance data is the cornerstone of<br>performance management; this analysis yields information that indicates<br>whether expected outcomes for the project are being achieved by the<br>contractor.<br><br>3.2 Performance management represents a significant shift from the more<br>traditional quality assurance (QA) concepts in several ways. Performance<br>management focuses on assessing whether outcomes are being achieved<br>and to what extent. This approach migrates away from scrutiny of compliance<br>with the processes and practices used to achieve the outcome. A<br>performance-based approach enables the contractor to play a large role in<br>how the work is performed, as long as the proposed processes are within the<br>stated constraints. The only exceptions to process reviews are those required<br>by law (federal, state, and local) and compelling business situations, such as<br>safety and health. A "results" focus provides the contractor flexibility to<br>continuously improve and innovate over the course of the BPA as long as the<br>critical outcomes expected are being achieved and/or the desired<br>performance levels are being met.<br><br>4.0 Performance Management Strategy<br><br>4.1 The contractor is responsible for the quality of all work performed. The<br>contractor measures that quality through the contractor's own quality control<br>(QC) program. QC is work output, not workers, and therefore includes all work<br>performed under this BPA regardless of whether the work is performed by<br>contractor employees or by subcontractors. The contractor will engage in<br>performance management to assess and monitor its own performance. The<br>contractor will perform self-inspection for quality, timeliness, responsiveness,<br>customer satisfaction, and other performance requirements.<br><br>4.2 The Government representative(s) will monitor performance to determine<br>how the contractor is performing against industry norms. The contractor will<br>be responsible for making required changes in processes and practices to<br>ensure performance is executed and managed effectively.<br><br>5.0 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES<br><br>5.1 The Contracting Officer (KO). The Contracting Officer (KO) is responsible<br>for monitoring compliance to the terms of the BPA and the individual orders<br>(calls), administration, and cost control and for resolving any differences<br>between the observations documented by the Contracting Officer's<br>Representative (COR) and the contractor. The KO will designate a COR as<br>the Government authority for performance management. The number of<br>additional representatives serving as technical inspectors depends on the<br>complexity of the services measured, as well as the contractor's performance,<br>and must be identified and designated by the KO.<br><br>5.2 The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR is designated<br>in writing by the KO to act as his or her authorized representative to assist in<br>administering the individual orders (calls) issued under this BPA. COR<br>limitations are contained in the written appointment letter. The COR is<br>responsible for technical administration of the project and ensures proper<br>Government surveillance of the contractor's performance. The COR is not<br>empowered to make any contractual commitments or to authorize any<br>contractual changes on the Government's behalf. Any changes that the<br>contractor deems may affect awarded price of an order (call), terms, or<br>conditions shall be referred to the KO for action. The COR will have the<br>responsibility for evaluation of the contractor's work performance. Government<br>surveillance may occur under the inspection of services clause for any service<br>relating to this BPA.<br><br>5.3 Ordering Officers. The Ordering Officer is designated in writing by the KO<br>to act as his or her authorized representative to administer the BPA and the<br>individual orders (calls). The ordering officer will be a designated school<br>official that will maintain a BPA log, BPA call file, and be authorized to place<br>orders (calls) up to the limit established by the KO in writing. The ordering<br>officer may also confirm the satisfactory completion of work and request<br>payment of submitted invoices for completed work.<br><br>6.0 IDENTIFICATION OF REQUIRED PERFORMANCE STANDARDS,<br>QUALITY LEVELS & PAYMENTS<br><br>The required performance standards and/or quality levels are included in the<br>PWS. If the contractor meets the required service or performance level, it will be<br>paid the amount agreed on in the order (call). Failure to meet the required<br>service or performance level may result in a payment delay or deduction from<br>the requested invoice amount.<br><br>Payment and Corrective Action: Full payment for a BPA order (call) will be<br>provided upon verification of overall acceptable performance by the DDESS<br>BPA COR at the school, as rated on quality, timeliness and cost. This<br>verification will be recorded in a simplified performance evaluation form<br>submitted to the KO and PM rating overall performance with a<br>recommendation for payment.<br><br>6.1 METHODOLOGIES TO MONITOR PERFORMANCE<br><br>6.1.1 Surveillance Techniques. In an effort to minimize the performance<br>management burden, simplified surveillance methods shall be used by the<br>Government to evaluate contractor performance when appropriate. The<br>primary methods of surveillance are: (1) Random monitoring and/or (2) 100%<br>Inspection.<br><br>Since each BPA order (call) is a Firm-Fixed-Price Contract, the Contractor's<br>performance will be evaluated by assessing the milestones and deliverables<br>associated with each individual order (call) according to two standards: quality<br>and timeliness. For each of these performance standards, the COR will assign<br>one of three ratings to the performance: superior, acceptable, or<br>unacceptable.<br><br><br>6.1.2 Communications. The contractor is expected to establish and maintain<br>professional communication between its employees and customers. The<br>primary objective of this communication is customer satisfaction. Customer<br>satisfaction is the most significant external indicator of the success and<br>effectiveness of all services provided and can be measured through customer<br>complaints. Performance management drives the contractor to be customer<br>focused through initially and internally addressing customer complaints and<br>investigating the issues and/or problems but the customer always has the<br>option to communicate complaints to the COR or KO as opposed to the<br>contractor.<br><br>6.1.3 Customer complaints, to be considered valid, must set forth clearly and<br>in writing the detailed nature of the complaint, must be signed, and must be<br>forwarded to the COR or KO.<br><br>Customer feedback may also be obtained either from the results of formal<br>customer satisfaction surveys or from random customer complaints.<br><br>6.2 Acceptable Quality Levels.<br>The acceptable quality levels (AQLs) included in Attachment 2, Performance<br>Requirements Summary Table, for contractor performance are structured to<br>allow the contractor to manage how the work is performed while providing<br>processes for performance shortfalls.<br><br>6.3 QUALITY ASSURANCE DOCUMENTATION<br><br>6.3.1 Performance Management Feedback Loop. The performance<br>management feedback loop begins with the communication of expected<br>outcomes. Performance standards are expressed in the PWS.<br><br>6.3.2 Monitoring Forms. The Government's surveillance will be annotated. The forms,<br>when completed, will document the Government's assessment of the contractor's<br>performance under the individual orders (calls) to ensure that the required results are<br>being achieved. The form will be maintained in the BPA file at the school.<br><br>6.4 ANALYSIS OF QUALITY ASSURANCE ASSESSMENT<br><br>6.4.1 Determining Performance. Government shall use the monitoring<br>methods cited in paragraph 6.1.1 to determine whether the performance<br>service levels have been met. If the contractor has not met the minimum<br>requirements, a corrective action plan may need to be developed to show how<br>and by what date performance is intended to be brought up to the required<br>levels.<br><br><br><br>6.4.2 Reporting<br><br>At the completion of each individual order (call), the COR will prepare a<br>written report for summarizing the overall results of the contractor's<br>performance. This written report, which may be the just the completed quality<br>assurance monitoring form, will become part of the BPA<br>documentation file. It will aid in the yearly required evaluation of the BPA<br>contractor thru the CPARS. The COR must coordinate and communicate with<br>the contractor and the KO to resolve issues and concerns regarding marginal<br>or unacceptable performance and must should be clearly documented.<br>Point of contact is daisy.ciarlariello@usace.army.mil.

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">The Office of Acquisition and Assistance, &nbsp;&nbsp;USAID/Bangladesh intends to modify Contract No. 388-C-00-07-00110-00 with Chemonics International Inc., 1717 H Street NW, Washington DC 20006, USA. The modification will extend the contract for a period of Four months from October 1, 2012 to January 31, 2013 and increase the total estimated cost by approximately $4,000,000. The purpose of the modification is to continue the activities under CLIN 2: <strong>Essential</strong> <strong>Service Delivery and Increased Efficiency of Smiling Sun NGOs clinics </strong>and CLIN 3: <strong>Expansion of the Service Delivery Network</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">&nbsp;The above contract was awarded to Chemonics International Inc. on a Full &amp; Open Competition basis on October 1, 2007 for 4 years at a total amount of $46,497,895.00. The purpose of the Smiling Sun Franchise Program is to maintain and expand the availability of essential health services and products in a way that reduces reliance on USAID funding for recurrent costs.&nbsp; This program expanded the availability of key family planning and health products and services to the poor, and partially achieved the population and health targets of the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) and USAID. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 15.0pt; line-height: 16.8pt;">USAID/Bangladesh intends to solicit and negotiate non-competitively with only one source (Chemonics International) under the authority of AIDAR 706.302-70(b) (5). The required services include continuation of services of the same nature as described in the original statement of work of the original contract. This extension allows for the continuation of integral ongoing project activities and sustainability of projects implemented under the contract. Seeking a new procurement to fulfill these ongoing services will be duplicative, costly, and time consuming.&nbsp; There will be no solicitation documents issued for the proposed action. Therefore, this notice of intent <strong>is not a request for competitive proposals</strong>. Interested persons may, however, identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. The Government will consider all expressions of interest received within a week (7) days after date of publication of this synopsis. &nbsp;A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed Contract modification based upon responses, if any, to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. &nbsp;Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
