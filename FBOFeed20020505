<DESC>This is a notice of intent to negotiate and award a sole source contract consisting of a base period of six months and two options to extend the term of the contract to Dr. Brian Dickens of Gaithersburg, Maryland to perform services to meet the following objectives of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Building and Fire Research Laboratory (BFRL), Building Materials Division (BMD), Polymeric Building Materials Group (PBMG): (1) Design, fabricate and implement printed circuit boards, computer hardware and computer software for automating and controlling custom-built temperature humidity generators and 5-axis light scattering apparatus; (2) Enhance (1) by adding graphical interface and graphical analysis capabilities to a NIST-developed software program called MOIST and to the 5-axis light scattering apparatus; and (3) Enhance laboratory automation, graphical analysis capabilitites, computer databases and computer databases mining capabilities for a number of projects within NIST BFRL PMBG.  Dr. Dickens has, for several years, been active in the design, assembly and programming of small printed circuit boards used in laboratory automation and in writing Microsoft Windows programs that interact with the microprocessors on the printed circuit boards.  Dr. Dickens is knowledgeable of the various electronic components such printed circuit boards contain, including those components used as sensors for temperature and relative humidity.  In addition, Dr. Dickens is skilled in designing and providing assemblies that function as intended.  Under other NIST BFRL contracts, Dr. Dickens has already written MS Windows programs that process and store images and extract data from images for the atomic force microscope and the confocal microscope.  Dr. Dickens has written several programs for NIST BFRL that process polymer photodegradation data, present the results graphically and store the results in databases that he designed.  Dr. Dickens also wrote similar programs for atomic force microscope data.  Based on the foregoing, Dr. Dickens is therefore well able to adapt the current BFRL photodegradation programs, which he wrote, to other uses and to the newer servers on which the databases will be stored.  Dr. Dickens wrote the user interface for the current implementation of the MOIST program and has already translated the calculation engine for the one-dimensional case from FORTRAN to Pascal and has integrated it into the user interface.  Based on the foregoing, Dr. Dickens has unique expertise that NIST BFRL PBMG requires and is therefore well qualified to translate the more complicated two-dimensional case and integrate that into the expanded user interface that he has already written.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source (Dr. Dickens) under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received no later than June 20, 2002 will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
