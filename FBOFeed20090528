<SUBJECT>Science to Practice: Developing and Testing a Marketing Strategy for Preventing Alcohol-related Problems in College Communities

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Coordinating Center for Environmental Health and Injury Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (CCEHIP/NCIPC) intends to award a sole source, 44 month firm fixed price contract in accordance with FAR Part 15 - Contracting by Negotiation, to Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation (PIRE), Prevention Research Center, 1995 University Avenue, Suite 450, Berkeley, CA 94704. PIRE is the only vendor developing and testing a marketing strategy for preventing alcohol-related problems in college communities. CDC anticipates soliciting and negotiating with only one source under the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) permitting other than full and open competition in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to systematically develop and test a strategy to market a comprehensive, community environmental prevention program, the Safer California Universities Project, that has demonstrated efficacy in reducing intoxication and alcohol-impaired driving among college students. The Safer Universities project combines alcohol management policies and enforcement with a publicity campaign targeting student drinking at private parties in homes and apartments (including fraternity and sorority houses) in the college community. The proposed approach for developing and testing the marketing strategy is broadly based on work by the CDC (Sogolow, Sleet, Saul, 2007), the NIH and health communication theorists such as Maibach and Bloodgood, (2006) who argue persuasively on behalf of using a marketing approach to move an evidence-based strategy to adoption by a wide audience.</p>
<p>The scope of work involves furnishing all the necessary personnel, facilities, supplies, and equipment required to systematically develop and test a marketing strategy for a comprehensive, community-based environmental prevention program that has proven effective in reducing intoxication and alcohol-impaired driving among college students as described in the Technical Requirements.</p>
<p>CDC believes that PIRE is the only source available to provide these services that meets mission critical requirements. This notice of intent is not request for proposal. A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This procurement is not set-aside for small business.

<SOLNBR>DARPA-BAA-09-51
<RESPDATE>072809
<ARCHDATE>06182010
<CONTACT>Dr. Ronald Esman, Program Manager, Phone (571) 218-4691, Email Ronald.Esman@darpa.mil
<DESC>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals for developing power-efficient and remotable high-speed analog to digital converters (ADCs) with high resolution. The proposed program (Remoted Analog-to-Digital Converters with De-serialization and Reconstruction or RADER) research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in analog-to-digital conversion. ADC systems enabled by RADER technology will be capable of operating in continuous time over a 10 GHz input instantaneous bandwidth (IBW) with a resolution of 10 effective number of bits (ENOB). Ultimately, it is desirable to be able to place the 10 GHz IBW so that input signals with frequency content of up to 18 GHz are captured. However, RADER technology demonstrations will focus on 10 GHz IBW at baseband (all Phases) in addition to 6 GHz IBW centered at 15 GHz (Phase III). Of particular interest is achieving these impressive goals within a dense input signal environment while simultaneously limiting the amount of dc power consumed to less than 50 Watts. Furthermore, in most applications, it is advantageous to sense analog waveforms at a point remoted from the components or subsystems that require significant portions of the power budget. The realization of such a continuous time analog-to-digital (A/D) system would create a unique new capability beyond the range of existing ADCs. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice. 

All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a full proposal to this BAA, should be directed to DARPA-BAA-09-51@darpa.mil. See full BAA document attached.

Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department's requirements as a key component of the Department's networking system.The equipment listed has undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and is approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassified and classified networks.This acquisition will be advertised on FedBid, a reverse auction site.<BR><BR>

<DESC>In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Pub L 111-5, THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  In accordance with FAR 5.704, Publicizing - Preaward, the Government posts this notice of intent to issue a modification to existing Department of State task order SAQMMA07F1066 under Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract SAQMPD07D0088 with AGTech, LLC, 1801 Research Boulevard, Suite 605, Rockville, MD  20850-3115.

The project description is as follows:  Arrange for and provide third party independent support to conduct Federal PKI Cross-Certification audits to support the Systems Integrity Division within the Bureau of Information Resources Management.

The original order was awarded as a competitive task order in the 8(a) set-aside pool between the ten Department of State Hybrid Information Technology Services for State (HITSS) 8(a) contractors.  The rationale for using other than a fixed-price approach is that the level of effort for the required IT services depends on variables that were not known prior ot task issuance and neither the Government nor the Contractor were able to estimate the extent or duration of the work with any reasonable degree of confidence.  Because of the uncertainly of the work, a fixed price task order could not be reasonably negotiated and only a labor-hour contract could be reasonably awarded.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Cross Match L SCAN Guardian Ten Print Fingerprint Reader/Scanner.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.
CA/CST requires the Cross Match L SCAN Guardian Ten Print Fingerprint Reader/Scanner for use with US visa programs.  The Homeland Security Council mandated the capture of all 10 fingerprints of visa applicants for whom US Consular officials receive information that indicates that they may have US law enforcement records.  On June 7, 2005, the Homeland Security Council decided as follows: "It should be the policy of the United States Government that biometric screening of foreign visitors to the United States be based on a fingerprint standard requiring 10-print capture at enrollment and 2-print verification thereafter." 
The Cross Match L SCAN Guardian Ten Print Fingerprint Reader/Scanner meets the following requirements:
	The scanner must be able to function as a drop-in replacement for the Smiths Heimann LS/2 Check fingerprint scanner and must perform at least as well as the Smiths Heimann LS/2 CHECK fingerprint scanner.	The scanner must be evaluated against the current Ten-Print Capture Scanner and Software Requirements specifications.
The Cross Match L SCAN Guardian Ten Print Fingerprint Reader/Scanner has undergone test and assessment, evaluation for overseas deployments and received final approval from the Department of State Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board.  The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

Reference: NCI-90103-AV on all correspondence. 

Part I: Background information and description of requirements:

The overall goal of the Translational Genetics laboratory is to develop new approaches to the study of the genetic basis of cancer and its outcomes. Specifically, to investigate the genetic basis of strong association signals identified in candidate gene association studies, loci identified by linkage analyses in high-risk families, or genome-wide association studies (GWAS), particularly the loci identified by the ongoing Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) program.

The CGEMS program involves GWAS of several major cancers such as pancreatic, bladder and lung. The studies that follow will address the functionality of the at-risk variant. One of the approaches involves a genome wide expression analysis of tumors and normal tissue to develop a comprehensive catalogue of gene expression in tumors and normal tissue. Expression levels will subsequently be compared to genomic variants (SNPs) to investigate if variants that increase the risk of cancer are accompanied with altered gene expression. This is one of the necessary steps to investigate the biological basis of the contribution of certain genetic variants to disease susceptibility. The goal of functional studies is to determine the mechanisms of gene function and how they are perturbed in disease. This research utilizes molecular biology immunological, genetic and biochemical technologies.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:

Part II   Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition 

1.         Statute:  This justification has been prepared under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) as set forth in 13.106-1 (b)(1).

(b) Soliciting from a single source.

(1)	For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers   may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).  

No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy agency need.  


2. Justification:  

Synpotics/Syngene is the sole supplier of the G:Box iChemi XR and  its accompanying accessories. There are several other automated imaging systems on the market, but none fully comply with what is needed to continue the research of the Genetics lab.

The following salient characteristics apply to the Syngene G:Box iChemiXR:

1. The maximum imaging area is 33x31 cm.
2. Automatic door lock for measurements over 30 seconds  prevents accidental opening of the door during critical long exposures.
3. Integrated RGB epi-illumination.  
4. Side panel access to cabinet electronics for easier service in the field.
5. PC keyboard control of aperture, zoom and focus adjustments.  
6. Total Recall function  One click recall of camera settings, lighting selection, and counting time  eliminates user errors in configuring image capture settings.
7. Zoom lens maximizes use of available camera pixels, independent of sample size.
8. Camera includes at least 8 separate aperture settings  required to maximize image intensity control for optimal image capture.
9. User selectable binning modes to control sensitivity.
10. Up to 5 megapixel image output using effective pixel technology  allows multi-level zooming of image results with no pixilation of data.
11. Analysis software utilizes auto lane finding, band finding,  and baseline correction modules to minimize user bias when analyzing data.
12. Software includes rolling disk baseline correction algorithm  an advanced algorithm for accurate separation of data from noise, independent of band width, and a data smoothing algorithm to eliminate false positives related to background noise.
13. 3 year warranty.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Molecular Dimensions Inc., P.O. Box 1001, Apopka, FL 32704. 

The reference number NHLBI-PB-(HL)-2009-169-DDC. 

The items to be purchase is: Product #  MD5-02 (3101), crystallization-grade incubators, quantity five (5) each, for storage of large numbers of crystallization experiments from high-throughput crystallization screens, to include complete with five (5) shelves, and U.S. power conversion (3186).

The system specifications consist of the following: Cooled incubator specifically designed for crystal growth that requires very precise temperature control, high temperature stability over long period of time and essentially vibration free environment.  
	Temperature range 0 -50C
	Accuracy better than  0.5C long-term (over several months)from
	Continuously adjustable heating and cooling to avoid overshooting
	Virtually vibration free
	100, 180, 250 & 390 liter capacity range
	Footprint of 61 cm (wide) x 64 cm (deep) 
The Government=s estimated expected delivery date is 8  10 weeks after receipt of the purchase order.

The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Bethesda, Maryland.

The sole source determination is based on the fact that the Laboratory of Nucleic Acids conducts research on function of nucleic acids in cells in health and in disease.  This acquisition is associated with studies aimed at deciphering the high-resolution atomic structures of nucleic acids, proteins and their complexes with each other and small molecules (including drugs and drug candidates) that regulate gene expression in health and in disease states.  One of the techniques used to unravel the high-resolution structure of these biological macromolecules is X-ray crystallography.  This technique allows the visualization at Angstrom resolution of nucleic acid protein structure.  However, in order to get this information, the macromolecular sample needs to be crystallized to order them in regular, nanometer-size array.  Crystallization requires precise and long-term control of temperature, and a low-vibration environment.  Moreover, the ability to scout different temperatures is critical to successful crystallization of these macromolecules.  Thus, in practice, five separate incubators, each set long-term to a different temperature, are required.  Due to limited space, incubators with compact footprint and that can be placed in close proximity to each other are required.  The total available linear space to house the five incubators is 315 cm.  In addition, to minimize the space needed in front of the incubators, the door width is limited to 61 cm.  The Molecular Dimension incubators have thin walls allowing the Government to install five (5) incubators in the laboratory limited space in the second basement of building 50.  Research cannot be conducted on the architecture of nucleic acids, proteins and their complexes without the storage of crystallization experiments in a stable temperature an vibration free environment that are providing from the incubators from Molecular Dimensions Inc. 
 
 
Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 423490 ,Other Professional Equipment and Supplies Merchant Wholesalers,  Employee Size Standard is 100.  The small business set-aside does not apply. This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures, and exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.  Responses to this announcement, referencing synopsis number  NHLBI-PB(HL)-2009-169-DDC  may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6142, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention Deborah Coulter.  Response may be submitted electronically to coulterd@nhlbi.nih.gov.  Responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC><p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) seeks to procure on a sole source basis Human1M-Duo v3.0 DNA Analysis Product (48) and - Product (96) with Illumina, Inc., 9885 Towne Centre Drive, San Diego 92121-1975. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) and FAR 13.5 01-(a)(1) to use Simplified Acquisition Procedure for commercial items. The North American Industry Classification System Code for this acquisition is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees. <br />The NIMH Child Psychiatry Branch (CPB) for nearly twenty years has been collecting samples of patients with childhood onset schizophrenia (COS), who seem particularly prone to have unique genomic alterations that are likely disease causing. Use of microarray analysis is part of the NIMH-CPB's functional techniques to investigate genomic alterations and has been successful with the use of higher density microarray technology made by Illumina. It has allowed for finer resolution of genomic variations that seem unique to schizophrenia with greater clarity. NIMH-CPB is&nbsp;now able to investigate detection of novel de novo amplification and deletion events and to more fully explore these genomic events that could potentially provide greater insight into schizophrenia with the requested products. <br />The NIMH-CPB requires Human 1M-Duo v3.0 DNA Product (48) and -Product (96) which represent a unique and advanced approach to addressing sensitivity and resolution issues in SNP and CGH analysis. The Human 1M-Duo v3.0 DNA Product (48) and -Product (96) are in-situ synthesized oligo microarrays. These microarrays consist of microscope slides aligned for approximately 1,000,000 target sequences. Each slide contains 2 arrays which will allow for 2 experiments to profile genome-wide DNA copy number variants (CNVs) on a single chip. These two products are used in conjunction with the Illumina Bead Station System and illumine Genome Analyzer Instrumentation. Illumina went to great lengths in the design of these arrays to validate and optimize the performance of the oligos on the arrays to guarantee optimum high quality. The dense placement of elements allows interrogation of over 1,000,000 regions of interest in a single experiment achieving greater density across the genome than previously possible over past years. The sensitivity of the design found by NIMH-CPB allows for consistent performance which&nbsp;unavailable through any other commercial source. The Human 1M-Duo v3.0 DNA Product (48) and -Product (96) are manufactured and sold exclusively through Illumina Inc. for use with the Illumina Beadstation System and Genome Analyzer Instrumentation. <br />The Molecular Genetics Section of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) in collaboration with the NIMH/CPB will run the microarray samples. The NIA owns and uses the Illumina Beadstation System and Genome Analyzer Instrumentation and run the NIMH/CPB samples as part of the research collaboration. NIMH/CPB had done a market research for competitive sources but found no available suppliers for this product. Therefore, it has been determined that Illumina is the only known source for the Human 1M-Duo v3.0DNA Product 48 and - Product 96, which have unique characteristics for the detection of smaller sensitive genomic events that are required for the expanding number of study samples. In order to maintain compatibility with ongoing studies/experiments, it is critical for the NIMH/CPB to acquire the Human 1M-Duo v3.0 DNA Product 48 and - Product 96 from Illumina, Inc. <br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NIDA/NIMH to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the Office of Acquisitions, NIDA, on or before 11:00 AM ET June 8, 2009. All questions must be in writing and can be emailed to Liem T Nguyen at ln18x@nih.gov or faxed to 301-480-1358 on or before June 4, 2009. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NIDA vendor must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, vendor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to issue a non-competitive Purchase Order to Teamstudio Inc., 900 Cummings Center, Suite 326T, Beverly, MA 01915 for the purchase of software licenses and one year of maintenance on the following applications:

Teamstudio Build Manager  including 3 days onsite training
Teamstudio Analyzer
Teamstudio Configurator
Teamstudio Delta
Teamstudio Snapper Client Edition

This software is necessary so that the component can set up its PolicyNet (Domino) change control process to meet the security guidelines demanded by the systems security audits.  For Domino-based systems, this software provides version control, rollback options, management control of the release from one environment to another, configurable workflow, audit trail, and closed-loop communication.  

The government believes that this software is the only off-the-shelf product that works natively with Domino and exactly matches the specifications set forth by the senior technical advisor.  The government also believes that this software is the only off-the-shelf product that provides change control at the application level for Domino and integrates it with build release control.

All responsible sources that believe that they are capable of meeting the SSAs requirements may submit a capability statement, which shall be considered by the agency.  If the SSA does not identify other acceptable sources capable of providing this requirement, SSA may issue a sole source award under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management, Department of Health and Human Services on behalf of the Indian Health Service (IHS), Office of Resource Access and Partnerships is seeking a Fiscal Intermediary (FI) to operate a centralized medical and dental claims processing and payment system to ensure that payments are made accurately and timely according to contractual requirements and maintain a centralized medical and dental claims reimbursement system.  The FI will also collect, compile, organize workload and financial data, and provide statistical and financial reports to IHS.  The Contractor shall calculate Medicare and other reimbursement rates to support IHS negotiation of Medicare pricing contracts and assist IHS in coordinating benefits.  The IHS has a responsibility for providing health care services to American Indian and Alaska Natives.  Direct Health care services are provided through a series of IHS-operated and Tribal-operated hospitals, clinics and health care programs. However, most IHS facilities are small and are unable to provide a wide range of health care services to their clientele.  Therefore, IHS supplements its direct health care services by purchasing basic and specialty health care services from non-IHS health care providers through its CHS program.

<DESC>The Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, supervision, inspection, materials, supplies, parts, tools, equipment, and vehicles required for investigative drilling of exploratory Core Boring (ECP) to locate and define the size of probable voids in the foundation of Joe Hardin Dam (Arkansas River Dam #3). The construction will consist of drilling pilot holes (ECP) through the 4 thick stilling basin floor, spaced 65 apart initially so as to determine the presence of the void laterally along the dam, and to determine if any conflict will occur in placing larger diameter bores that may be used for better inspection for voids and/or as injection portals for placing fill into the voids. Work to include but not limited to conducting Conflict Camera Inspection (CCI) via small diameter underwater camera inserted through each pilot bore to determine possible conflict with stilling basin floor concrete embedded items, wood piling and piling head reinforcement, piping, or joints and water stops, and place exploratory borings if voids are found.  Based on void detection, intermediate borings will be drilled along the centerline of the initial borings, at 35 feet spacing to obtain more detailed knowledge of the void size and its cause, and to install portals at close enough spacing to assure that remediation infill materials can be injected uniformly and then vibrated to flow thoroughly into the foundation.  This project work will proceed incrementally to determine extent of damage along the dam.  A possible additive item of work will be to install flexible stainless steel secondary relief well filers in manholes to stabilize the existing pressure relief system which may be damaged sufficiently to allow foundation soil to still be escaping under normal operation.  Another possible additive will be installation of new pressure relief system slide gate valves.  Work shall be performed in strict accordance with with all the terms, conditions, technical specification, drawings, attachments, appendices, Exhibits, etc., contained in the specifications.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) Office of Contract Operations in support of the Coast Guard Logistic Information Management System Project Management Office to conduct market research regarding the state of the market for COTS products that will meet the Coast Guards need for a Logistic Information Management System.

Description and Capability Requirements: 

The Coast Guard Logistics Information Management System (CG LIMS) Acquisition Project will require a centrally managed, integrated, enterprise-wide logistics information management system to support U.S. Coast Guard assets and systems.  This system will provide logistical support for aircraft, cutters, boats, shore facilities and Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Information Technology (C4IT) systems.

The Coast Guard objective is to acquire a logistics system that will leverage industry standards and best practices to increase efficiency, optimize effectiveness, and establish common processes for managing logistics across the enterprise.  The ability to maintain full operational capabilities and minimize lifecycle costs are fundamental goals.  The required CG LIMS system will be robust and interoperable with legacy Coast Guard and other government agencies logistics and financial systems.  CG LIMS will interface with existing and future Coast Guard logistics and financial systems as information technology (IT) systems are transformed and modernized.  As such, the system will need to be Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) compliant, and be scalable and flexible in meeting existing and future requirements.  

The CG LIMS software solution is expected to use state-of-the-market, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) tools, including an Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) tool configured to meet the business requirements of the Coast Guard.  CG LIMS configuration, integration and deployment will occur in discrete segments that will provide new capabilities and functionality or consolidate and replace existing logistics IT tools.  CG LIMS will be an important tool used to support the Coast Guards Logistics Business Model and the Four Cornerstones of that model:  Configuration Management, Total Asset Visibility, Bi-Level Maintenance and single point of accountability through Product Line Managers. 

CG LIMS will be designed to function on the Coast Guard Data Network (CGDN+), with future migration to DHS OneNet.  It will be hosted at Coast Guard Operations Systems Center (OSC) and be accessible through Coast Guard Standard Workstations (CGSW) or other Coast Guard standard hardware.  An overview of the Coast Guard SOA and Enterprise Architecture (EA) is provided in Attachment #1- CGEA.

A design goal of the CG LIMS program is to reduce the amount of software development by using proven, well supported COTS IT tools.  Minimizing customization of COTS tools will allow the Coast Guard to obtain the benefits of commercial best practices implemented in the COTS tools. 

CG LIMS will use an Evolutionary Acquisition approach based on an Incremental Model.  This approach is expected to speed delivery of capability, providing improved capability in a shorter period of time.  The initial deployment will be followed by subsequent segments of capability.  Each cycle will produce a working system.  The defined segments are listed below: 

CG-LIMS Segments:
(1) Configuration and Maintenance Management (focus of this RFI), 
(2) Supply Chain Management, 
(3) Technical Data Management, 
(4) Financial Integration and 
(5) Additional Integration.  

The CG LIMS project and strategy will follow the DHS System Engineering Life Cycle policies and processes.

It is very likely that the complexity and breadth of the CG LIMS requirements and Coast Guard business processes will demand a solution that consists of more than one major IT tool.  In addition to EAM capability, CG LIMS may use technical data management, content management or other IT tools to address all requirements successfully. 

Requested Information: 

For the purposes of this RFI, we ask respondents to consider all the aforementioned segments of the program while providing information specific to Segment 1, Configuration and Maintenance Management.

At a minimum, responses to this RFI should address the following: 

1.  How would you organize your approach to deploying and integrating multiple COTS software products for the Coast Guards enterprise logistics system?

2.  Briefly describe your software configuration management methodology. (Include software configuration management tools you typically utilize)

3.  Indicate all Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) costs and cost drivers for implementing your product. (Include software, maintenance, licenses, tech data, training, support, etc.)

4.  Briefly describe the Deployability of your product. Please include:
-Success stories and current industry and government customers
-Flexibility of your product (scalability, customization, and integration)
-Limitations/constraints of your product (user capacity, integration limits, ease of use) 

5.  What would be your technical approach to integrating your product incrementally and replacing one or more of the Coast Guards current logistics IT tools for: 1.) Asset Configuration and Maintenance management, 2.) Supply Chain management, 3.) Technical Information/Data management, and 4.) interfaces with other CG systems such as Financial management and Accounting systems?

6.  What would you consider as the significant technical risks associated with implementation of your product and how would you mitigate those risks? Provide past examples, if possible.

7.  Please indicate whether your software is available on GSA Federal Supply Schedules, other Government-wide Agency Contract (GWAC), or Open Market.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award Sole SourceSpecial NoticeNAICS Code:  512110 Motion Picture and Video ProductionSynopsis:The Veterans Integrated Service Network # 4, Altoona, PA, Contracting Office, intends to issue a sole source award to Lucky Forward Films, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(2)(iii). The justification for the sole source is that this requirement can only be delivered by Lucky Forward Films as the company has compiled several original documentaries of proprietary research and actual field footage from the 162nd Infantry that forms the basis for training family and other services provided to Veterans of the United States.  No other vendor/contractor has a compilation of such data; the quantity and of quality of continuous field footage is unmatched.  This procurement will be a commercial item request under FAR Part 12 and 6.302-1.  If you believe that your company  has the capability to meet this requirement please e-mail Daniel.Shea2@VA.GOV prior to June 2, 2009 and before  1:00 p.m. Eastern Time.   Requirement:VHA's mental health programs are a benchmark for the Nation for the treatment of conditions such as severe and chronic mental illness, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction disorders, homelessness and the treatment of dual diagnoses, among other areas.  Mental health services include inpatient, outpatient, and residential programs for severely, chronically mentally ill veterans, those with PTSD, veterans with substance abuse disorders, and those who have been dually-diagnosed (i.e., substance abuse and another mental disorder).  Mental health services also include Healthcare for Homeless Veterans Programs, Psychosocial Rehabilitation Programs (including Incentive Therapy, Compensated Work Therapy and Supported Employment), and all other mental health programs and services, including those found in Community-Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) and Domiciliary Residential Rehabilitation and Treatment Programs.  This requirement involves reaching out to service members and family members in new and unique ways is vital to outreach efforts.  To establish dialogue with this audience we need to employ vital tools such as "This is War" which connects to service members and their real-world war experiences.  In order to reach out to family members, we need to educate them on their loved ones experiences in a combat environment because service members may not be ready to discuss their experiences with their families.  The film will also provide VA clinical and administrative personnel charged to take care of these veterans, exposure to experiences in a combat theater.        This announcement is in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1).Daniel P. Shea, Contract SpecialistDaniel.Shea2@VA.GOV

<CONTACT>Michael R. Jurkowski, Phone 7036032117, Email mjurkowski@abilityone.gov
<DESC><p>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Ambulance Kits and the kit's components by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>6545-00-NIB-0088, Kit, Ambulance - Kit for ambulances. The kit contains (1) PPSB Lift sheet, 40 inch x 80 inch, (1) Blue PPSB Isolation Gown, (1) Blanket, Disposable, Gray, 40 inch x 80 inch, 100 percent polyester, (1) White, Pillow, Disposable, 12 inch x 16 inch, 17 oz.</p>
<p>The contracting agency involved is the Department of Veterans Affairs, Hines, IL.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Ambulance Kits or the components in the kits to the Department of Veterans Affairs and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>None identified.</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing Ambulance Kits or the components in the kits to the Department of Veterans Affairs for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than June 11, 2009 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to<br />(703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<p><a name="BM_1_"></a></p>
<p>FPI Production of Paper Shredders</p>
<p>FSC code 7490</p>
<p>
<p>&nbsp;On March 11,2009, Federal Prison Industries, Inc (FPI) posted a notice in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps). In this notice, FPI proposed to manufacture paper shredders competitively without using its mandatory source. Paper shredders fall within Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code 7490.</p>
<p>FPI received comments from an interested party in the industry. These comments pertained to the potential negative impact that might occur should FPI produce paper shredders directly for federal agencies and add this product to FPI's Schedule of Products. Being sensitive to the private sector's concerns, the FPI Board of Directors has directed FPI to provide paper shredders only as a subcontractor, should opportunities arise.</p>
<p>This notice, therefore, announces FPI's intentions to provide paper shredders, FSC 7490, miscellaneous office machines, on a competitive basis as a subcontractor only, and not use its mandatory source status.</p>
<p>Interested parties have a right to comment or raise questions with FPI's Board of Directors. All written correspondence should be addressed to: Chief, Strategic Business Development and Marketing Branch, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534.</p>

<CONTACT>Matt Courtad, Email courtadmj@od.nih.gov
<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  This notice does not constitute a solicitation and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government will not reimburse the costs incurred by potential contractors in providing the information requested herein.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to award on a sole source basis a purchase order to Lab Products, Inc. of Seaford, DE for various caging components for rodents for the Division of Veterinary Resources (DVR) in the Office of Research Services (ORS). The rationale for this Intention to Sole Source can be found in FAR 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 

NAICS Code is 314999  All Other Miscellaneous Textile Product Mills
Federal Supply Classification is 6640  Laboratory Equipment and Supplies.  

The new caging and components will provide replacement and turn around caging, caging components and water bottles for rodents housed in Lab Products micro-isolator cage racks.  They will also provide other replacement caging for existing rodent cage set ups and for future housing requirements.  Products available from interested vendors need to match the requirements and specifications and provide interchangeability with similar items previously acquired from Lab Products, Inc. as stated below. 

Requirements:

Description
15oz. wedge-shaped threaded water bottle;	Unit: Case;	Quantity: 80
Stainless steel, 2-1/2 straight sipper tube;	Unit: Case;	Quantity: 80
Zytem ultra-high temperature plastic twist cap;	Unit: Case;	Quantity: 100
Zytem super mouse cage with air grommet;	Unit: Case;	Quantity: 100
Zytem super mouse micro-isolator filter top;	Unit: Case;	Quantity: 100
Stainless steel lid for super mouse front feeder;	Unit: Case;	Quantity: 100
Zytem cage, 19 x 10-1/2 x 8 for rats;	                     Unit: Case;	Quantity: 100
Zytem micro-isolator filter top for rat cage;	Unit: Case;	Quantity: 100
Zytem mouse cage, 11-1/2 x 7-1/2 x 5;	Unit: Case;	Quantity: 100


Specifications:
All cages, cage components shall be interchangeable with existing racking systems which are Lab Products, Inc. Micro-isolator Cage Racks, Model Nos. 92140ARM and 92160ARM.  The DVR has standardized rodent caging systems in multiple facilities.  All caging, cage components and water bottles shall be able to withstand autoclaving at 270 degrees Fahrenheit.  Items required are:
1) 15oz. wedge shaped threaded water bottles;
2) 2-1/2 stainless steel sipper tubes;
3) plastic twist caps;
4) rodent cages for mice with air grommets.  Air grommet location shall be 008, cage measurements shall be 12-7/8L x 7-1/2W x 5-5/8D;
5) micro-isolator filter top to fit mouse cage;
6) stainless steel lid to fit mouse cage;
7) rat cages measuring 19L x 10-1/2W x 8D;
8) micro-isolator filter top to fit rat cage;
9) mouse cages measuring 11-1/2L x 7-1/2W x 5D.

Lab Products, Inc.
The DVR has purchased numerous ventilated racks over the past 7 years which utilized the cages, cage components and water bottles from Lab Products, Inc.  

DVR maintains rodent facilities on both the Bethesda and Poolesville campus that house approximately 20-40,000 cages of animals.  These animals are housed in high temperature polycarbonate cages and filter tops.  They are also provided water in high temperature polycarbonate bottles.  Cages, cage components and water bottles are routinely sanitized and autoclaved to maintain a clean environment that is conducive to good animal health.  This weekly sanitation is also a requirement to maintain AAALAC accreditation.  The sanitation process exposes the caging, filter tops, cage components and water bottles to cage wash chemicals and extremely high temperatures that will destroy the integrity of the cage over time.  After repeated exposure to the chemicals and high temperatures, caging, filter tops, cage components and water bottles will break; crack and can become brittle or cloudy.  When this occurs, they can no longer be used, as they become an unsafe environment in which to house animals.  The stainless steel wire bar lids for the tops of the cages also get bent or broken by washing equipment or normal wear and tear.  As such, the cages have a relatively short lifespan and a proportion of the above cages must be replaced with new on a yearly basis.

Interested parties are required to review the above requirements and submit a statement of interest which includes: itemized firm fixed price costs and documentation of the capabilities of meeting the Governments requirements. The submission is due at 3:00 pm, Thursday June 4, 2009. The submission must also include any prompt payment discount terms, the Duns & Bradstreet (DUNS) number, the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and the vendors business size. The vendor must also register in the Governments Contractor Registry System, www.ccr.gov. The determination of the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a future competitive procurement. Reference synopsis number NIH-OD-2009-126-MJC, proposals may be submitted by mail to the  Office of the Director - OLAO, Office of Acquisition, 6011 Executive Blvd, Room 529I, Rockville, Maryland 20852, Attention: Matthew Courtad, by fax transmission to (301) 402-3407 or by email to courtadmj@od.nih.gov. All responsible sources may submit information, which if timely received, shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC><p>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Mammal Laboratory located in Seattle, WA on a sole source basis with David Ellifrit. The government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures Proposed contract is for upgrading of existing Cetacean Assessment and Ecology Program's (CAEP) Killer Whale photo-identification catalogue. Specifically, unique identification numbers will be assigned to individuals of separate ecotypes, "resident" and "transient", photographed in surveys conducted since the catalogues were last updated. The existing catalogues will be cross-referenced to the North Gulf Oceanic Society (NGOS) photo-id catalogue, and a joint numbering scheme will be assigned to both catalogues. Killer whale survey work by CAEP/NMML began in this region in the early 1990s, and since 2001 the extent of field studies has increased, with both survey work by CAEP and the North Gulf Oceanic Society (NGOS). One population of killer whales in this region has been designated as depleted under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act, killer whales have been accused of being responsible for multiple declines of other marine mammals in Alaska, killer whales interact with and consume fish caught by both long-line and trawl fisheries in Alaska, and by-catch levels of killer whales in commercial fisheries cannot be properly evaluated because of uncertainties in population structure and abundance. Therefore, there is a strong need for collaborative studies to take advantage of this growing and extensive amount of data. Photo-identification data is the primary type of data being collected by both CAEP and NGOS, with individual whales being uniquely identified from photographs of natural markings. These data can be used to estimate abundance using both minimum count and mark-recapture methods, and to describe individual movements and distribution patterns that can be used to examine population structure. To make inference from photo-id data, it is essential to compile and maintain a catalogue of uniquely identifiable individuals, which can be easily referenced to assign individual identification numbers to each photo-id data point. David Ellifrit has worked on the photo-identification of killer whales in the North Pacific for over two decades. He has been the sole curator of the CAEP photo-identification catalogues, he has unique knowledge and visual memory of the individual whales in our study area. The government intends to negotiate a firm- fixed price contract with period of performance of twelve months from date of award plus three option years. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 15 days of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government.

5. Background: 
	The NGJ system is intended to replace the capability currently enabled by the ALQ-99 jamming pods, providing a significant enhancement to the EA-18Gs EA capabilities at a reduced operations and sustainment cost.  First identified in the 2002 AEA System of Systems (SoS) AoA, there is a compelling need, founded in both capability and sustainability to move beyond the ALQ-99. This need was recently re-validated in the Joint AEA (JAEA) Study, conducted by the Office of Secretary of Defense Program, Analysis and Evaluation [OSD (PA&E)].  
	In January 2009, the Office of the Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (AT&L) approved the NGJ AoA Analysis Plan, which formally began the AoA.  This 15-month study is intended to serve as an aid to decision makers in the areas of acquisition strategy, budget strategy, and requirements generation.  Further, the analysis information will be used to inform Program Objective Memorandum (POM-12) decisions for NGJ. On January 15th 2009, the AoA LIPT posted its initial RFI seeking information from industry, academia and government agencies pertaining to NGJ System Concepts (SC) and other pertinent technical and program related information.  This initial RFI remains posted at the Federal Business Opportunities web site location identified above.  Across the months of February and March 2009, the AoA LIPT received information in the form of briefings from the initial RFI respondents and utilized that information, as well as information derived from other sources, to develop sixteen (16) non-proprietary NGJ SCs suitable for integration on the EA-18G and representative of all three AoA Alternative Categories described in Section 6.  At the time of this initial round of the RFI and subsequent SC development, the AoA LIPT lacked sufficient information relating to the F-35.  Consequently, respondents to the initial RFI could not adequately address this element of the AoA, nor could the AoA LIPT sufficiently develop NGJ SCs applicable to the F-35. Since this time, the AoA LIPT, the Services and the F-35 Joint Program Office have developed sufficient information to remedy this situation, and through this RFI, will now initiate a process to develop NGJ SCs suitable for the F-35.  As opposed to being a stand-alone process, all NGJ SCs and related information developed thus far for EA-18G will be considered.         
6. AoA Guidance: Information below provides a summary of key information contained within the approved AoA Guidance. More complete AoA Guidance was provided in the NGJ AoA Directives Extracts Document, issued as GFI at the time of the initial RFI posting. In accordance with Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff instructions; the USN completed a NGJ Functional Solutions Analysis (FSA) to illustrate how the NGJ system can provide a solution to current and projected EA-18G/ALQ-99 program of record gaps in war fighting capability.  The FSA concluded that no non-materiel solutions to the acknowledged EA-18G/ALQ-99 gaps exist.  The materiel solutions explored in the FSA show the NGJ system provides increased war fighting capabilities over the ALQ-99 on the EA-18G.  The FSA cost estimates for NGJ found the potential program to be an Acquisition Category (ACAT) ID level program.  
An AoA is required to determine courses of action to correct current and projected gaps in ALQ-99 capability and supportability.  The scope of the NGJ AoA will include analysis of the ALQ-99 TJS baseline and potential NGJ candidates to be initially integrated onto the EA-18G and potentially the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. When employed against a target set that includes conventional and irregular warfare radar and communications systems, NGJ-equipped aircraft are expected to have the same, or better, level of airborne electronic attack capability as an EA-6B ICAP3 aircraft, operating the ALQ-99 and ALQ-218 systems.  NGJ should provide improved Reliability, Maintainability and Availability (RMA) over that of the ALQ-99. All NGJ alternatives will be assessed as candidates for use by the EA-18G and F-35.  There are three alternative categories for the NGJ AoA.  They are as follows:

Alternative Category 1: Incremental modernization of the current ALQ-99 TJS sub-system, starting with the oldest and/or most critical bands (such as Bands 4 and 5/6).

Alternative Category 2: Fielding of a new jamming system that draws on technology at technology readiness level (TRL) 5 or 6.  Concepts within this alternative should incorporate commercial off-the-shelf technology as feasible.  

Alternative Category 3: Exploration of the costs and benefits of a new jamming system based on a lower initial TRL.  Concepts within this alternative should initially address the core component requirement currently filled by the ALQ-99.  However, it should use technologies that could be adapted for future jamming systems that address all AEA system of systems mission areas.

7. RFI Response Input to AoA: The Navy requests from interested sources information that supports the development of NGJ SCs that fit within the AoA Alternative Categories and are suitable for use on the F-35. Multiple SCs may be submitted for each alternative category, or sources can limit information to only one concept for one alternative. For each SC, technical and program-related information is desired that addresses each of the following areas:

a.	Identification of the AoA Alternative Category which the SC addresses.
b.	The platform or platforms (F-35, EA-18G) to which the SC applies. 
c.	Descriptions of the SC that illustrates its major sub-systems, the SCs size, weight and prime power demands, and its installation on the platform(s). Information explaining how the SC addresses needs for modular and open architecture is desired.      
d.	Identification of an existing NGJ SC, developed under either the AoA or NGJ Technology Maturation (TechMat) Trade Study contracts, to which this SC most closely matches.
e.	Identification of unique aspects of the SC that are directly linked to the F-35 AEA CONOPs, including discussion of inherent (i.e. without NGJ) F-35 EW capabilities and their impact on NGJ SC requirements. Discussion of Own-ship and off-board interoperability and EW Battle Management opportunities are also desired.  
f.	The technical aspects of the platform integration for the SC, including its interfaces with other systems (weapons systems, controls/displays, etc) on the platform and any projected platform modifications.  Interfaces with and required modifications to existing ES/ESM receivers & radar systems should be described, as should impacts to platform performance (e.g. range, ceiling, on-station time, signature).  If the SC involves the use and integration of new hardware/software with a portion of the ALQ-99 (e.g. Low Band Pod containing Low Band Transmitters and Universal Exciter Upgrade), a description of such and identification of associated issues is desired.  
g.	An assessment of unique and common programmatic and technical attributes between the SC and its comparable SC(s) for the EA-18G, including the degree of hardware/software commonality, technology differences, development timelines, etc.   
h.	Identification and discussion of unique (not common with an EA-18G NGJ SC) component and sub-system technologies required to develop the SC, their current TRL, the time lines required to achieve TRL 7.
i.	An assessment of the time required to develop and field the SC, including a projected Initial Operational Capability year in which a single F-35 squadron could be operationally deployed. In addition to this assessment, provide an estimated schedule of major events and milestones for the SC.  
j.	An assessment of technical, schedule and cost risks envisioned for the SC and recommendations for mitigation of risks assessed as moderate or high.   
k.	Describe any opportunities for which an NGJ SC might fulfill an F-35 warfighting need outside of AEA missions. 

	The government desires submitted responses to be formatted in a manner suitable for oral presentation that organizes information to follow paragraphs a) through k) immediately above.  The presentation may be classified up to the SECRET/NOFORN classification level. The title page of the presentation should identify the name and address of the source and a primary and secondary POC (including name, phone number and email address).  Use of Microsoft Office (PowerPoint, Excel, Word, Project) and Adobe products is required. The government requests one paper copy and two electronic copies of the presentation materials. 

8. Proprietary/Limited Distribution Information Markings: It is incumbent upon sources providing a presentation in response to this RFI to identify all data contained within that is proprietary and/or has limited distribution requirements.  

9. General Information: The cost of preparation of a response to this RFI and any costs related to RFI briefings, meetings, and answering government-posed questions are not considered allowable direct charges to any other contract or tasking.  RFI response presentations will not be returned. Interested sources are advised that the employees of commercial firms under contract to the Government will serve as technical reviewers of information provided in the response briefing to this RFI. By submission of a response, a source gives the Government permission to release proprietary information to employees of those organizations listed below.

We will begin the Forum with an overview of GSAs Recovery Plan and provide the location, scope and project descriptions on the 33 projects slated for action across this region.  Since the Recovery Plan is meant to stimulate the economy as quickly as possible, many of these projects will be carried out by current GSA contractors.  However, there will still be a number of prime and subcontracting opportunities available for new contractors.

We will also provide useful information on participating in GSAs Schedule Program and teaming arrangements.  The Forum will conclude with a networking session with GSA contracting officers and project managers.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 funds measures necessary to convert Federal facilities into high-performance green buildings.  GSA will renovate and construct Federal buildings, courthouses and land ports of entry.  We are looking for cost effective, high quality and environmentally friendly commercial products and services.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONSUBJECT: Home Medical Equipment	          As required by FAR 6.303-2, the following information is provided for these procurements. 1.  Requesting Agency:  Central Texas Veterans Health Care System                       1901 Veterans Memorial Drive                       Temple, TX  76504 Contracting activity:     Central Texas Veterans Health Care System                       1901 Veterans Memorial Drive                        Temple, TX  76504 2.  Description of supplies or services required to meet agency needs, including estimated value: Provide labor, transportation, materials, tools and storage to provide Home Medical Equipment furnished to the VA to eligible beneficiaries of the Central Texas Veterans Health Care System.3.   An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.    41 U. S. C. 253 (c) (2), Unusual and compelling urgency4.  A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. Allumed is accredited by the Joint Commission, which is a contract requirement. This company has provided satisfactory delivery and repair services to veterans in the Central Texas area for over the past 10 years.5. A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.  This requirement, VA257-RP-08-RP-0187, was posted to FedBizOpps.  FedBizOpps data showed that there were 41 vendors interested in this requirement; however, no offers were received.6.  A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.   Price analysis will be will be utilized for this procurement. The proposal will be reviewed and the proposed price will be compared to the Independent Government Estimate (IGE).  7. A description of the market research conducted.  Market research was conducted using a variety of methods.  The Central Contractor Registration (CCR) allows research to be conducted using the Dynamic Small Business Search which is supported by the Small Business Administration.  A search was also conducted from VetBiz and also the Joint Commission since this procurement requires a contractor to have Joint Commission accreditation in order to perform the services. Although there are a significant number of contractors providing service under this NAICS most lack the required Joint Commission Accreditation.8. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:It was anticipated at the time this requirement was identified that there would be competition among three (3) known vendors who were Joint Commission accredited. None of these vendors submitted a proposal which leaves the Central Texas Veterans Health Care System without a contract to provide home medical equipment to eligible beneficiaries. 9.  A listing of the sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.   None.    10. A statement of the actions the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.   A sources sought document will be posted to FedBizOpps in an effort to identify potential offerors. The VA would request that potential offerors provide information with regards to their capabilities to provide the required service. When this requirement is reprocurred an Industry Day may be held in order to provide Industry the opportunity to ask questions which could result in a revision to a Statement of Work that may or may not have been completed. Industry input could result in a more cost effective way in which services may be provided.11. Certification requirement:   I certify the supporting data, including the statement of the Government's minimum needs and other rationale for other than full and open competition is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge.  							_____SIGNED____________________________________               April 27, 2009Signature of Technical/Requirements Representative                               DateThis justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. _____SIGNED___________________________________               April 30, 2009Supervisory Contracting Officer                                                                  Date

<DESC><p>&nbsp;A sole source procurement is being contemplated with Hexcel Corporation, 6700 W 5400 S, Salt Lake City, UT. 84118-7678 and Hexcel Reinforcements Corp, 1913 N King St, Seguin, TX. 78155-2115. The Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Directorate, Ordnance Division, Ordnance Integration Branch (AFRL/RWMI) desires to purchase the following: Fiber Spool, Quantity 650lbs of Hexcel IM7 GP6K Fiber Spool (Tow) and Plain Weave Fabric, Quantity 400lbs, which translates to 1133 yards of Hexcel IM7 Fabric (Style: SGP193P IM7 GP 6K). In order for the overall material testing program to have validity and continuity, it is imperative that the above described test materials are the exact same composition as previously tested fiber spool and plain weave fabric supplied by Hexcel Corporation. Because the material properties of the required materials must have the same mechanically strengthened and heat treated processes applied under the same conditions as previously tested materials, no other material would be acceptable without extensive revalidation of materials and strength testing, which would add extensive costs and program delays of up to one year. However, all interested parties may submit statements of capability (SOC) which should, if possible, include at least three references from customers who have purchased the above materials for use as preformed fragments in weapons; these will be considered if received by noon central time zone on 18 Jun 09.
<p>Submit to: Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/RWK), Attn: Michael Rivera, 101 W. Eglin Blvd., Ste. 337, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6810. Please refer technical questions to Mr. Matthew Matyac, 850-883-1973, and business questions to Michael Rivera, 850-883-2681.</p>
<p>An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and all recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process. Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the contracting points of contact identified above.

<DESC><p>A sole source procurement is contemplated with North American Hoganas, Inc. (NAH), 11 Hoganas Way, Hollsopple, PA 15935-6416. AFRL/RWMW has a requirement for the following: One (1) each 8600 lb. ingot of ES1-35 Eglin Steel and one (1) each 8600 lb. ingot of S1-40 Tool Steel for evaluation in the Advanced Warhead Evaluation Facility (AWEF) Dynamic Properties Laboratory for application to future high speed penetrator programs. This purchase will support AFRL/RWMW in the AWEF Dynamic Properties Laboratory for application to Eglin Steel Reproducibility Program. In order to develop and produce this more advanced steel and ensure the proper quality control requirements are met, the Government requirement mandates using the production process of (1) Induction Furnace melting with Argon Stirring, (2) Ladle Refining with Argon Purging capabilities and (3) Vacuum Degassing Treatment. NAH has provided this steel before utilizing the above production processes. Additionally, the steel will be Vacuum Arc Re-melted (VAR) and forged into 11.0 inch billets. Other companies were contacted previously about this requirement but none were able to provide the small melts needed for a reasonable price using the same production techniques; hence, NAH was awarded the original and subsequent orders. Purchasing from another company would not only cost much more but, more importantly, introduce unacceptable risk into the accuracy of the evaluation results since the production process for the melt by another firm would not be exactly the same as the process used by NAH. However, all interested parties may submit statements of capability; these will be considered if received by noon central time zone within 15 days of publication of this notice (28 May 09). Submit to: Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/RWK), Attn: Mark Fitzgerald, 101 W. Eglin Blvd., Ste. 337, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6810. Please refer technical questions to Dr. Morris Dilmore, 850-882-9644, and business questions to Mark Fitzgerald, 850-883-2670.

The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. <br /><br />(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).<br /><br />(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the USAF Academy Ombudsmen,</p>
<p>Kelly Snyder<br />8110 Industrial Drive, Ste 103<br />USAFA, CO 80840<br />Telephone number 719-333-2074<br />FAX 719-333-2379<br />email:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kelly.snyder@usafa.af.mil<br /><br />Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.<br /><br />(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. <br /><br />(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.

This solicitation number is NHLBI-PB-(HL)-2009-155-DDC and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32 (5/14/2009).

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business. It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to procure the services from TTP Labtech LTD., Melbourn Science Park Melbourn, Royston Herts SG8 6EE, UK for the following:

1.	Part Number: 3019-0003, 2 position deck mosquito robot for crystallography, includes: 1 pipette loader, power cable, calibration block, 1 Pilate-seal holder, 1guide book, 1 spool 4150-03020 non-sterile pipettes, 1 pack 5ul micro-reservoir strips, 1 pack 2ul micro-reservoir strips, 1 pack ViewDrop plate-seals, 1 pack of 96 Well Clear Polystyrene Microplate for hanging drop 4-position ultra low reagent holder, quantity two (2) each

7.	Warranty shall consist of replacement of any defective component that fails due to faulty manufacture or design defects for a period of two (2) years from installation. 
8.	Training shall also be provided by the manufacture for up to four (4) people for a period of five (5) days. 

The sole source determination is based on the fact the Laboratory of Nucleic Acids conducts research on function of nucleic acids in cells in health and in disease.  This acquisition is associated with studies aimed at deciphering the high-resolution atomic structures of nucleic acids and proteins.  One of the techniques used to unravel the high-resolution structure of these cellular macromolecules is X-ray crystallography.  This technique allows the visualization at Angstrom resolution of macromolecular structure.  However, in order to get this information, the macromolecular sample needs to be crystallized to order the RNA or protein molecules in large regular arrays.  This research requires a liquid handling robot for setting up small scale, high-throughput crystallization experiments in 96, 384 and 1536 - well format, because of the susceptibility of RNA to degradation by contaminants, it is necessary that the liquid dispensing unit of the robot employ disposable pipet tips.  Due to severe space limitations, the footprint of the instrument cannot exceed 15 inches (width) by 19 inches (depth).  The Mosquito robot manufactured by TTP Labtech allows the high-throughput screening of tens of thousands of chemically distinct conditions that give yield to high quality macromolecular crystals that are used for diffraction analysis.

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 423690 and the business size standard is 100. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business. It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to procure the services from LASAG Industrial-Laser, 1615 Barclay Boulevard, Buffalo Grove, IL 60089 for the following:

1.	Part Number: 01.6300, ProLas HO-18 with Automatic Door, to include all of the basic equipment plus support for the laser source and monitor. Table travel X 18, and extended enclosure, quantity one (1) each
2.	Part Number: 01.6341, ProLas: DDR-01 rotary on full size Prolas, quantity one (1) each

6.	Training shall also be provided by the manufacture for a period of two (2) days. 

The sole source determination is based on the fact that the Translational Medicine Branch (TMB), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), is manufacturing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) compatible devices for interventional cardiac procedures under MRI. The Branch plans to expand the current lab to vastly widen device applications.  Currently the lab does not have capability to shape MRI compatible sheet or tube metals based on micromaching principles.  The laser computer numeric control (CNC) cutting is a phenomenal technique for this purpose due to the very small beam diameter (18 microns) that is not possible to achieve with conventional mechanical cutting equipment. LASAG Industrial-Laser is the manufacture of the required laser and the required laser is compatible with an existing Lasag laser source with all optical parts including laser equipment to be used for building laser CNC cutting equipment. Therefore, with the CNC laser cutting workstation from the same company this allows the laboratory to have a highly compatible system.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

Dr. Norton has been working with the other IC elements for over 5 years on specific science and technology searches leveraging his class of undergraduates to search broad areas and has devised innovative ways to present their findings.  His classroom has proven to be a valuable platform for the discussion and adoption of unclassified OSINT collection and visualization tradecraft which inherently increases the number of students with an understanding of basic intelligence analysis techniques.  The highly technical nature of the code development results in limited expertise in the US.  All of these factors give Auburn University and their staff the unique capability and experience to perform the requirement.  This capability cannot be replicated at other institutions within the timeframe DIA/MSIC requires completion.</p>

No solicitations shall be issued other than this notice. This requirement is currently unfunded with no guarantee that monies will be appropriated in the current fiscal year.  Proposing against this requirement is strictly voluntary. All responsible sources may submit a proposal to MSIC by FAX 256-313-7963 or email to Donna Tignor at tigor@msic.dia.mil.  All proposals must be received by 1600 Central Daylight Savings Time 11 Jun 09 and must be proposed FOB Destination.

<DESC>Amendment 0001- This amendment is issued to extend the reponse date from 02 June 2009 to 09 June 2009. This amendment also provides answers to questions which have been recieved.<BR><BR>Question and Answer<BR><BR>Q1. The manufacture would like clarification on the stainless frame.  Do you also need the channel and bearings stainless? Do the rollers need to be stainless? <BR><BR>A1. The parts have to be made so as not to rust. Aluminum will work or stainless steel.  It will not e used in food processing so the stainless steel requirement is not necessary, as long as it is corrosion resistant and can with stand the weight loads.<BR><BR>Q2. Do we need include an installation price for the conveyor? <BR><BR>A2. No.<BR><BR>Q3. Do you want the belt to encapsulate the product with cleats and side frames OR must the belt have side curtains to encapsulate on all (4) sides of belt? <BR><BR>A3. It must be a trough conveyor. As such by design it will have its own side walls do to the U shape of the trough.  With the cleats the bulk product will be surrounded on all four sides.<BR><BR>Q4. 36in Stainless steel frame sections over the entire 26 ft length (requires one odd bed length) or 10ft bed lengths and 3ft beds on both ends  26 ft OALength?<BR><BR>A4.  The entire belt must be 26ft long. Belt must enable continuous flow. <BR><BR>Q5. 60fpm  but variable speed range of __ to __?<BR><BR>A5.  Foot pedal with variable speed control for operator (potentiometer). Remote mounted controller able to move conveyor a controlled distance (distance between cleats) with a push button. Emergency stop. The foot-pedal must be a potentiometer design control rate of 1 fpm to 60 fpm.  The remote mount must be able to move the conveyor a fixed distance between sections. <BR><BR>Q6. Do you want controls mounted & wired OR shipped loose to be installed by customer? If mounted & wired, please give specific information where each is to be mounted? (Please note, the controls listed on the diagram page DO NOT exactly match those listed on the spec page. Please clarify.)<BR><BR>A6. Controls must be wired and installed.<BR><BR>Q7. Painted safety Blue OR stainless steel frames OR Stainless frames painted safety blue?<BR><BR>A7. Safety blue.<BR><BR>Q8. Clarify 6 high side skirts&are these 6in high guard rails OR 6in depth of frames?<BR><BR>A8.  6in high guard rails.<BR><BR>Q9. Clarify HD 2 recycler cleats on 20in centers. How does this compare to a standard bolt-on cleat? <BR><BR>A9. Stands for 2 the HD heavy duty. Some bolt on cleats may end up tearing through the belt due to a repetitive bearing force if it gets caught.<BR><BR>Q10. Pan Covers on bottom of conveyor? <BR><BR>A10. Pan covers not necessary.  The conveyor will not be used in that manner.<BR><BR>Q11. 0-60 degree F? Freezer app or outside temperatures? <BR><BR>A11. Ability to operate in temperature range of 30 degrees F-125 Degrees F. Conveyor will be processing cold metal at 0 degrees F. <BR><BR>Q12. Chute by others? Please give more information about how it will be loaded on to belt. <BR><BR>A12.  Material will be dropped 40ft vertical from a press. Material will land on a chute and slide onto the conveyor. No portion of the conveyor can be greater than 42in high. <BR><BR>Q13. Clarify outdoors application with temperature from 0-125 degrees F?<BR><BR>A13. Conveyor will run outdoors. Temperatures from 0-125 degrees F. Conveyor will have no cover from the elements. <BR><BR>Q14. Is conveyor covered at all or totally exposed to elements? <BR><BR>A14.  Totally exposed to the elements. <BR><BR>Q15. I have a question concerning the belt, your specifications item #2 states the following: Belt type: Black PVC 200 COS, trough with side walls and cleats. Q.  Does this mean you want corrugated side walls on the belt? The picture does not show side walls on belts.<BR><BR>A15. Trough side walls are not considered CORRUGATED SIDE WALLs. The trough configuration produces sidewalls because it is in a trough configuration a U shape. There will however be a need for sidewalls on the frame of the conveyor. <BR><BR>Q16. More questions: belt cleat centers. The spec says 20ft. We are assuming 20in. Frame construction: stainless steel. Should the skirts be stainless steel? Should the leg supports be stainless steel? What does Bolt-together 36in stainless steel frame sections mean each section no longer than 36in? would this include the slider bed & the skirts? What does Belt Returns : Bottom Covers mean?<BR><BR>A16. The conveyor belt is effectively 24in. However the cleats are only 20in on center because the other 4in will be absorbed by the trough configuration.  The skirt does not have to be stainless steel. A stainless steel frame is not necessary. An aluminum frame will work. <BR><BR>Q17. Is this Conveyor to be explosion proof, i.e. meeting Article 500 of the National Electrical Code, NFPA 70?<BR><BR>A17. No. <BR><BR>Q18. Will the conveyor belt be required to meet Electrical Conductivity as measured per ISO 284? <BR><BR>A18. Yes. <BR><BR>Q19. Will contractor be required to install conveyor on site? <BR><BR>A19. No. <BR><BR>Q20. Will Set-up and Training of operators be required? <BR><BR>A20. No. <BR><BR>Q21. Is the material being conveyed bulk or in boxes/trays? Also since this is inert we assume that the system does not have to be explosion proof. Please advise. <BR><BR>A21. The material will be in bulk. Explosion proof is not necessary as all material is inert. <BR><BR>Q22. On the sheet titled Conveyor Minimum Specifications, item #3 states Frame<BR>Construction: 10ga bolt together with 36in stainless steel frame sections.<BR>Item #11 states Paint: Color: Safety Blue. Does this mean the supports<BR>and/or other components other than frame sections can be painted steel<BR>construction? Please clarify what components must be stainless steel, and<BR>what components can be painted Safety Blue. Controls as follows? a. (1) Potentiometer Foot Pedal. Located where? b. (1) Remote Control w/100' cord. Is this the VFD? In a Panel w/an e-stop button on it? If so, does this panel need a start & stop button on it? <BR>c. (1) start button (1) stop button (1) e-stop button mounted on conveyor? <BR><BR>A22. Paint all components safety blue. Controls as follows. a. The potentiometer foot pedal will need to be attached with a cord to the ground near the conveyor.  It is not on the technical drawing but is labeled in the additional specifications. b. Define VFD. The panel will need to be able to move the conveyor belt on 20in at a time or a potentiometer similar to the foot pedal.  The remote will be placed in a building for running the conveyor during hazardous operations.  The emergency stop must be on the conveyor per OSHA standards. c. E-Stop mounted on the conveyor. On/Off switch on the conveyor. The control of the belt must be controlled from the foot pedal and the remote control unit.  A bypass switch shall be placed on the remote control so only one control unit can function at a time.<BR><BR>Q23. I am currently working on your quote for this conveyor. On the drawing it states Remote control with 100 cord with Emergency Stop. Could you please specify this? Is this handheld or a panel on a stand? Is the 100 cord electrical wire?  <BR><BR>A23. The 100 cord is for the remote control unit, so it can be placed at the control station.  The emergency stop needs to be placed on the conveyor itself per OSHA standards.  The remote unit needs to be able to be placed on a small table or stand flat.  100ft cord is for the control unit. <BR><BR>Q24. Frame Construction: what is meant by 36in S.S. frame sections, because the length of conveyor is 312 and 36 is not the multiple!<BR><BR>A24. 36in SS frame means. The greatest distance in width of the conveyor usual at the motor 36in or 36.5in.  The stainless steel is the metal of the frame.  Aluminum can be used as an alternative but it must be rust proof.<BR><BR>Q25. Trough: We do not see a trough&do they want the side rails to angle in like a trough. <BR><BR>A25. Trough is in additional specifications, not on the drawing. The belt should be similar to the attached picture. <BR><BR>Q26. Sidewalls: attached to the belt&Looks like they have tapered sidewalls&please confirm! <BR><BR>A26. See attached photo. A trough conveyor is requested. <BR><BR>Q27. Cleats: Do these need to be bolt on&we weld our cleats into the cover of the belt.<BR><BR>A27. Weld on cleats are sufficient. Bolt on cleats are preferred. <BR><BR>Q28. Paint color-When the frames are from SS material, we understand that color if for the legs and other partsplease confirm!<BR><BR>A28. The conveyor is to be painted safety blue. <BR>

<DESC><p>Modification #001</p>
<p>Responses to questions submitted on 5/26/09.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Is there a rail site near the plant so shipments can be delivered by rail?</p>
<p>Yes, there is a&nbsp;Union Pacific rail line within 100 yards of the plant.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;there is storage at the Nogales plant for less than 15,000 gallons.&nbsp; The plant will take deliveries in the range of 6,500 to 12,000 gallons at a time.&nbsp; Any rail car storage issue will be&nbsp;between vendor and Union Pacific.&nbsp; Vendor would still be required to unload and deliver product via truck.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Are you currently purchasing carbon?</p>
<p>IBWC&nbsp;is not purchasing glycerin at this time.&nbsp; It is being purchased by the construction manager as part of the Nogales plant start agreement.&nbsp; Once the facility is under IBWC's&nbsp;control, the agency&nbsp;will be required to provide the glycerin with&nbsp;agency&nbsp;funds.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Is this a new requirement?</p>
<p>Yes, this is&nbsp;a new requirement for the new Nogales International Wastewater Treatment Plant to be completed on or about 6/23/09.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Modification #001</p>
<p>Responses to questions submitted on 5/27/09.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;In reference to question #2 above, please advise from whom the plant manager is purchasing material, price per gl paid and FOB terms.</p>
<p>Since this is currently not&nbsp;our contract to purchase product, we are unable to provide information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Do you use any activated carbon in your wastewater treatment process? I was reading through the bid document and only saw glycerin and corn syrup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;No we do not use activated carbon. We had looked at it as a possible source but the expense was too great. Also we are limited by the equipment we have to use&nbsp;glycerin or corn syrup. Any other carbon source would require us to invest quite substantially in&nbsp;infrastructure to support it (this rules out methanol, ethanol etc.).</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer a question posed by a potential quoter.

Question:  I have a question regarding #9  Plasma Cleaning Option:

Do they want just the head, that can be used with the power supply (two heads at one time, either 2 sputtering heads or 1 sputtering head + plasma cleaning head), or do they want the capability to have 2 sputtering heads plus the plasma cleaning head all active in one run?

Answer:  The best solution for us is to have 2 sputtering heads plus the plasma cleaning head all active in one run.

All terms and conditions of the original solicitation, including the closing date and time, remain unchanged.

<DESC>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the
Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the
authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and
capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of
intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals
received within thirty days after date of publication of this
synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the
Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses
to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of
determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)  When there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by --

     (ii) For DOD, NASA, and the Cost Gaurd, Unique supplies or services available from only one or a limited number of sources or from only one or a limited number of suppliers with unique capabilities.


DFAR 206.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

(a) Authority.

(2)(i) Section 8059 of Pub. L. 101-511 and similar sections in subsequent defense appropriations acts, prohibit departments and agencies from entering into contracts for studies, analyses, or consulting services (see FAR Subpart 37.2) on the basis of an unsolicited proposal without providing for full and open competition, unless
     (1) The head of the contracting activity, or a designee no lower than chief of the contracting office, determines that

          (i) Following thorough technical evaluation, only one source is fully qualified to perform the proposed work;

AFFAR IG 5306


 ONLY ONE RESPONSIBLE SOURCE (OR LIMITED NUMBER)

Guidance regarding use of this authority is at FAR 6.302-1. It applies when either the required supplies or services are available from only one responsible source, or, for DoD, when one or a limited number of responsible sources can satisfy agency requirements. Solicitations for other than full and open competition will not be released until the J&A has been approved when proceeding under this authority.

When Appropriate:

This authority is appropriate when impediments to full and open competition are known to exist, even though there may be more than one potential source. It is normally used for follow-on acquisitions when only specified sources are capable of performing the effort due to their involvement in earlier phases or contracts. The key to distinguishing a limited competition from a full and open competition is the type of information provided in or with the solicitation. If the offerors must possess additional information from previous efforts under the program in order to perform the proposed contract and the government is unable to provide this information, the competition is not full and open. This does not mean that the information must be so detailed that even Joes Garage could build a radar system. Potential competitors must have appropriate financial and technical resources (or the ability to obtain them) and the technical experience and organizational controls needed to accomplish the work within the required or proposed delivery schedule. The use of this exception may be appropriate under the following conditions:

       7. There is other reasonable basis to conclude that the governments minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one or a limited number of suppliers with unique capabilities (see FAR 6.302-l(b)(l)).


The minimum requirement is for this Flight Simulator Training, in all models of the C-130 Aircraft (A-H).  This training must meet these minimum requirements to be considered acceptable:

     1.  Flight training must be in a full motion (6-degrees of Freedom) simulator that can be configured for all models A-H

     2.  Flight training must include a full scale VAST simulator copit of the C-130 aircraft for simultanious training of the cockpit aircrew.

     3.  Flight training must also include classroom and computer simulation to include basic aircraft operations, general avaiation guidlines.

     4.  Flight training is to support several Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Customers as well as US Military and Government Students.

     5.  The supplier must have un-restricted access to the full motion simulator in order to support changing schedules of FMS students and have the ability to conduct the abouve training requirements simultaneously to support several students in different stages.


Interested parties will be required to certify the ability to meet the above minimum requirements.

The program office anticipates awarding, on or about 28 FEB 2010, a competitive Firm Fix Priced (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract of five years in length for the production ATP-SE systems.  Total requirement are for an estimated 670 systems, of which approximately 275 new systems are anticipated to be procured via this activity.  The actual quantity will be dependent on requirements, price and available funding.  The ability to handle classified material will be a requirement for award of any contract(s) that may result from this notification.  The purpose of this notification is to determine whether any competitive sources exist and to notify industry of any impending actions so that possible subcontracting opportunities may be pursued.Any IDIQ Contract resulting from this sources sought synopsis will be to acquire the non-developmental ATP-SE as a follow-on system to the AN/AAQ-33 targeting pod.  The ATP-SE is an external, pylon-mounted targeting pod and will be integrated onto the F-16, F-15, A-10, B-52 and B-1 platforms with the potential for integration onto other military platforms.  The targeting pod is capable of producing infrared and visible imagery of both ground and airborne targets.  The pod provides laser ranging and designation in support of weapon delivery, navigational functions, recording and data-linking of generated imagery and data.  The imagery will allow for greater stand-off ranges and increase target identification.  The Government does not contemplate providing any data or drawings related to the existing targeting pods already in the Governments inventory.  This contract may include activities for both existing and new targeting pods such as providing support equipment, spares and product support to include but not limited to: field and depot level support, sustaining engineering, software support and integration, technical data, aircrew and maintenance training, initial spares, provisioning, flight test support, Contractor Logistical Support (CLS), special studies, efforts in support of contingency operations and contractor field team support to include emergency fleet repair support, as well as integration, test, and production and installation of future modifications and enhancements as new technologies become available.Interested companies must submit a Statement of Capabilities not to exceed 10 pages addressing the following areas: 1.

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The United States Air Force (USAF) is seeking interested sources regarding fielding additional tactical aerial targeting pods/Advanced Targeting Pod Sensors Enhancement (ATP-SE).  The sponsoring activity is Aeronautical Systems Center, 647th Aeronautical System Squadron, Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, OH.  The program office anticipates awarding, on or about 28 FEB 2010, a competitive Firm Fix Priced (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract of five years in length for the production ATP-SE systems.  Total requirement are for an estimated 670 systems, of which approximately 275 new systems are anticipated to be procured via this activity.  The actual quantity will be dependent on requirements, price and available funding.  The ability to handle classified material will be a requirement for award of any contract(s) that may result from this notification.  The purpose of this notification is to determine whether any competitive sources exist and to notify industry of any impending actions so that possible subcontracting opportunities may be pursued.Any IDIQ Contract resulting from this sources sought synopsis will be to acquire the non-developmental ATP-SE as a follow-on system to the AN/AAQ-33 targeting pod.  The ATP-SE is an external, pylon-mounted targeting pod and will be integrated onto the F-16, F-15, A-10, B-52 and B-1 platforms with the potential for integration onto other military platforms.  The targeting pod is capable of producing infrared and visible imagery of both ground and airborne targets.  The pod provides laser ranging and designation in support of weapon delivery, navigational functions, recording and data-linking of generated imagery and data.  The imagery will allow for greater stand-off ranges and increase target identification.  The Government does not contemplate providing any data or drawings related to the existing targeting pods already in the Governments inventory.  This contract may include activities for both existing and new targeting pods such as providing support equipment, spares and product support to include but not limited to: field and depot level support, sustaining engineering, software support and integration, technical data, aircrew and maintenance training, initial spares, provisioning, flight test support, Contractor Logistical Support (CLS), special studies, efforts in support of contingency operations and contractor field team support to include emergency fleet repair support, as well as integration, test, and production and installation of future modifications and enhancements as new technologies become available.Interested companies must submit a Statement of Capabilities not to exceed 10 pages addressing the following areas: 1. Capability to meet all technical requirements 2. Capability to provide Contractor Logistical Support (CLS) 3. Ability to demonstrate systems integration across the aircraft fleet 4. Capability to produce technically competent analyses on the multiple areas covered in the above paragraph 5. Description of previous or current experience in precision targeting systems 6. Show ability to start delivery on or about 14 months ARO.The ASC/647th AESS/TZ Program Office intends to host an industry day at Wright Patterson Air Force Base at a date to be determined to discuss the capability requirements for the ATP-SE in greater detail.  This industry day will include an unclassified open session and closed one-on-one sessions to discuss classified requirements.  The closed sessions are reserved for prime contractors only (prime contractors will be allowed to bring team members of their choosing) with the ability to handle classified material whose clearances are verified by the 77th Aeronautical System Wing Security Office.   Further notification and information regarding this industry day will be posted in the near future.THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION. This is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources, and will be used to determine the basis for any competitive aspects of the acquisition.

<DESC><p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>5/28/09 Amendment:</strong></p>
<p>CDC received the following&nbsp;additional question:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question</span></strong>: Please see the following question related to Section L provision 352.270-19 Electronic information and technology accessibility (January 2006) on RFP pages 46 and 47:
<p>CDC has directed bidders to include a completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template as part of the technical proposal. This template is 8 pages long. Would the Government allow bidders to include the completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template as part of the business proposal, so as not to count against the 75 page limit for the technical proposal?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Response</strong></span>:&nbsp; CDC hereby <span style="text-decoration: underline;">excludes</span> the Section 508 template from the Technical Proposal 75-page limit.&nbsp; Offerors are instructed to include the completed Section 508 Template as an Appendix (appropriately identified) to the Technical Proposal.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Only this Section 508 Appendix is excluded</span> from the 75-page limit; any other Appendix an offeror includes in the Technical Proposal is subject to the 75-page limit.</p>
<p>CDC&nbsp;has prepared&nbsp;Amendment 0003 (attached) to incorporate this&nbsp;change to the solicitation. The change is added to page 51, Subfactor 1, subparagraph 4).&nbsp; Offerors are reminded to acknowledge receipt of ALL amendments in accordance with the instructions included in the SF 30, block 11 (attached).</p>
<p>&nbsp;_________________ End of Amendment 5/28/2009 notice _________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>5/20/09 Amendment:</strong></p>
<p>CDC received additional questions and has prepared its response provided as an attachment.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Amendment 0002</strong></span> is also attached to incorporate changes to the solicitation arising from the questions received to date. Offerors are reminded to acknowledge receipt of ALL amendments in accordance with the instructions included in the SF 30, block 11 (attached).</p>
<p>_________________&nbsp; End of Amendment 5/20/2009 notice _________</p>
<p><strong>5/18/09 Amendment:</strong></p>
<p>CDC received another question which is included in the attached response.</p>
<p>Also, CDC has made&nbsp;changes to the Statement of Objectives (SOO) which&nbsp;are included in the attached Amendment (i.e. SF 30).&nbsp; Offerors shall acknowledge the Amendment as per instructions contained in block 11 of the SF 30 (attached).&nbsp; The changes in the SOO are located in paragraphs 9 and 10.&nbsp; The proposal due date remains the same.</p>
<p>____________&nbsp; End of Amendment 5/18/09 notice _______________</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>5/13/09 Amendment:</strong></p>
<p><strong>CDC received the following question</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Understanding that questions are not due until June 1, 2009, we have a question with regard to the page limit that we believe is critical to offerors as they work to prepare their best responses to this RFP. We wish to clarify that the page limit is indeed 75 pages, inclusive of appendices. Based on experiences bidding other CDC RFPs where this language was included in the RFP and then subsequently amended so that appendices were considered outside the 75-page limit, we wish to clarify this as early as possible in the bid process. To learn that the appendices are excluded the page limit after June 1 will make it virtually impossible for offerors to respond appropriately by the June 22 deadline.
<p>If the page limit stands as it is currently stated in the RFP, we appreciate the clarification and will respond accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>CDC response</strong>:&nbsp;reference Section 'L' on page 50 of the Solicitation, subparagraph L.9 which reads:</p>
<p>L.9 Proposal page format:</p>
<p>Pages shall be 8 &frac12; x 11, Times New Roman font, 12 pt pitch. Page fold-outs will count as 2 pages. Text printed on double-sided pages will also count as two pages. <strong>Where a page limit applies</strong>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the page limit includes</strong></span> cover letter, table of contents, index, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">appendices</span></strong>, attachments, illustrations, charts, tables, diagrams <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>and all other documents</strong></span>.</p>
<p>The solicitation stipulates a <strong>75-page limit</strong> for the <strong>Technical Proposal</strong>; thus, since a page limit applies to the Technical Proposal, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>then appendices are included in the page limit</strong></span> pursuant to the instructions in subparagraph L.9.</p>
<p>&nbsp;---&nbsp;&nbsp; End of 5/13/09 Amendment ----</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
</p>
<p><strong>Solicitation Notice</strong>:</p>
<p>The solicitation # <span style="text-decoration: underline;">CHS-RFP-2009-FTG7</span>&nbsp;is hereby posted as of May 08, 2009.&nbsp; The solicitation is&nbsp;attached to this amendment as MS Word file. Reference Section "L" of the solicitation for detailed&nbsp;proposal preparation and submission instructions.</p>
<p><strong>CDC received the following question from an interested offeror</strong>:</p>
<p>According to a recent news article, CDC has received a database from FEMA that is very important for conducting the Children's Health Study. We are wondering whether CDC can release information on the contents of the database (e.g., variables that will be provided to the contractor) before the RFP is released.</p>
<p><strong>CDC's response is as follows</strong>:</p>
<p>The following are the variable fields that I have in the data sets from FEMA:<br /><br />In the applicant database (NEMIS) there are:<br /><br />Registrant ID<br />Name - first, last, middle initial<br />Applied date - date applied for assistance<br />email<br />Pre-disaster address - street, city, state, zip, zipext<br />Current address - street, city, state, zip, zipext<br />phone number - area code, number<br />alternative phone number - alt area code, alt phone number<br />Social security number<br /><br />FRRATS databases for the states:<br /><br />Registrant ID<br />name - first, last<br />Site address (trailer location address) - street, city, state, zip, county<br />lease date<br />vacate date</p>
<p>CDC makes no representation as to the accuracy, completeness or usefulness&nbsp;of the information contained in the FEMA NEMIS database.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Pre-solicitation notice</strong>:<br />This pre-solicitation notice is posted pursuant to FAR 5.203(a), to advise interested offerors of the Government's intent to solicit proposals for a "full and open" competitive acquisition for a project titled: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Children's Health Study</span> (CHS). The attached draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) describes the Government's objectives for this acquisition. Offerors responding to the solicitation (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">when it is released</span>) will be responsible for developing and submitting their own Statement of Work (SOW) based upon the objectives contained in the attached draft SOO.</p>
<p><br />The contracting officer's "full and open" acquisition strategy decision is based upon the Government's evaluation of capability statements received in response to a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) posted to FEDBIZOPS on 2/17/2009. The Government will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> accept or consider additional capability statements at this time because the market research phase has ended.</p>
<p>In addition to the draft SOO, this notice also includes questions received in response to the Request for Information (RFI) posted on 11/21/ 2008 and the Government's responses. The attachment was previously posted with the aforementioned SSS and is provided again as a convenience to those interested offerors who may be unfamiliar with the "history" of this acquisition.</p>
<p><br /><strong>No response to this notice is requested or required.</strong></p>
<p><br />This notice is not a request for proposals. The contracting officer will request proposals when the solicitation is posted to FEDBIZOPS some time after this 15-day mandatory, preliminary notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />The Government anticipates making a single contract award for a cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) type contract. The rough order magnitude (ROM) of the contemplated contract is between $100Million to $150Million. As explained in the attached draft SOO, the resulting contract will consist of two phases: (1) A two-year Feasibility Study and (2) a six-year Full Study phase.</p>
<p><br />Any questions regarding this notice must be in writing to the contracting officer via email: ftg7@cdc.gov prior to the expiration date of this notice.</p>

1.       Each quantity requests a Magnum Light Generator, followed by a suffix: NGL, SON, AJO, TUS, and DGL.  A review of Magnums website indicates they have lite generators, but not any with the suffixs shown.
2.      The options/accessories listed for all:  electric winch, battery disconnect, lens guard, and anti glare visor are items that are used on light towers; not just a generator or light generator.  A review of Magnums light towers does not show that they have any with the listed suffixs.
3.      A review of Magnums GSA website does not show any specific model that relate to the listed suffixs.
 


ANSWER: I believe they are concerned with the abbreviations after each item.  (i.e., SON, TUS, DGL, etc.) 
 
These are our BP Station identifiers  not part numbers.  For example, SON means Sonoita BP Station, DGL means Douglas BP Station and so on.   It just indicates how many of each item each station has requested in their part of the bulk purchase.<BR><BR>The United States Border Patrol, Nogales, AZ Station requests the award of this sole source order in order to purchase the exact replacement generator/light towers, currently being utilized at the Nogales Station. Magnum generators are on GSA contract schedule to be distributed through Magnum Products LLC and/or their designated distributors.   This sole source proprietary procurement enables the US Border Patrol to maintain uniformity and consistency by obtaining exact replacement packages thus allowing for easy, low cost maintenance and installation.  The integrated package allows for greater flexibility among assets and manpower.  
This contract is expected to be filled by a sole source.  Justification is based on the unique technical characteristics.  Similar equipment would require considerable existing equipment modifications to meet the specific needs required by the Nogales Border Patrol Station.<BR><BR>

In addition, components of this type cannot be placed on the network without being approved by the IT CCB; and it takes sever months to get new items approved. This item is already on the IT CCB approved list.IRM/OPS/ITI/GITM has identified the equipment listed as a key component of the Department's networking system. Equipment listed is required to provide network connectivity to existing DoS enterprise network infrastructure. Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department for compatibility with existing hardware and software at this time will cause unacceptable delays to the Program in support of the unclassified and classified IT refreshes.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department's requirements as a key component of the Department's networking system.The equipment listed has undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and is approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassified and classified networks.This acquisition will be advertised on FedBid, a reverse auction site.<BR><BR>ITEMS MUST BE DELIVERED 7 DAYS ARO<BR><BR>

<DESC>DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  Grouting of Concrete Riser for Water Supply Intake, Upper Petit Jean Site 9, Logan County, Arkansas.  The work shall consist of repairing cracks in a concrete riser that is the principal spillway of a watershed lake.  The cracks are located in the elbow and transition section that goes from a 72 diameter concrete conduit to the riser outlet which is 6 wide by 12 tall.  There are three known cracks that extend in a random pattern from the construction joint on one side of the elbow/transition section across the top and down to the construction joint on the other side.  The cracks are to be completely filled to eliminate the seepage of water and to restore structural integrity.

This procurement is unrestricted.

CONTRACTOR SELECTION CRITERIA:  Contractor selection will be based on the following factors, listed in descending order of importance:  (1) Past Performance (projects of similar size and scope) and (2) Experience (projects of similar size and scope).  All evaluation factors for contract award selection other than cost or price are approximately equal to cost or price.  The Government reserves the right to make contract award(s) without negotiation, based on initial offers.  There will not be a public bid opening.

CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS:  Successful offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), http://www.ccr.gov, and must have completed the Online Representations and Certifications (ORCA), https://orca.bpn.gov/, to receive a contract award.  Failure to register in these systems will result in the offer not being considered for award.  The solicitation will be posted to FedBizOpps on or about May 30, 2009, with offers received on June 30, 2009, or as stated in the solicitation.  A site visit to view the work site will be scheduled.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to further revise the Pre-Solicitation noticed issued on March 27th, 2008 for the procurement of: POWER AMPLIFIER ASSY; NSN:5996-01-560-8971, PN: 12900638-2.  Competition for this procurement is restricted to Curtiss Wright Controls Inc. and Borisch Manufacturing as authorized by FAR 6.302-1.  Any interested vendor other than Curtiss Wright Controls or Borisch Manufacturing would have to develop a comprehensive test plan and have it approved by BAE Systems and Project Manager - Heavy Brigade Combat Team (PM-HBCT) office.  In addition, any interested vendors would need to possess specialized Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) which emulates all the hardware and software functions of the Turret Drive Control Unit (TDCU).  It would require a substantial initial investment in tooling, test equipment, and time to develop the proper ATE.  Given this, no other vendors will be able to accomplish the above in a cost effective manner and within the required delivery schedule set by the Government.  Interested parties please note, the Government plans to issue an award for this effort within 60-90 days.  In addition, the Government will not provide, nor consider providing, any Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) for testing purposes.<BR><BR>FOB is Destination.  This action will result in a Firm Fixed Price, 3 year IDIQ with a minimum guaranteed quantity of 69 each.  This solicitation will be issued electronically in accordance with FAR 4.501 and 5.102, therefore hard copies will not be provided. Vendors wishing an electronic copy may download it on or after the issue date by accessing the following address via the internet: https://aais.ria.army.mil/AAIS/Solinfo/index.htm. <BR><BR>CAUTION: This solicitation will be issued electronically as will any amendments thereto. Because of this, the Government is under no obligation and is in fact unable to maintain a bidders mailing list. It is therefore incumbent upon any interested parties to periodically access the above internet address in order to obtain any amendments<BR>

<p>**** 1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: This announcement is 100% set-aside for Small Businesses only. a) The Savannah District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers requires the services of Architect-Engineer (A-E) firms for a minimum of one and a maximum of three multidiscipline Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC) for large projects. These contracts are being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act, as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6. See numbered note 24 for general information on the A-E selection process. Firms will be selected for negotiations based on demonstrated competence for the required work. Offerors are cautioned to read this announcement in its entirety. Contracts awarded as a result of this announcement will be administered by Savannah District for use on federal projects under its jurisdiction and, if requested, for other Corps of Engineers Districts within the South Atlantic Division as well as for U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Centers of Standardization within CONUS and Hawaii. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence for the required work. Contracts may be issued up to one year after selection approval. Typically, the contracts will consist of three ordering schedules, each schedule not to exceed one year, for a total of up to three years maximum. The total amount of each contract over the three year ordering period may not exceed $4,500,000. Work will be issued by negotiated firm-fixed price task orders. Task Orders will be primarily for large projects with a construction value greater than $2 million, however as required, smaller projects will be executed under these contracts. These task orders are firm fixed price. Projects to be designed are not yet determined and funds are not presently available. Assignment of individual task orders to the contracts with identical scopes of work will be based on the following factors: (1) Performance and quality of deliverables under the current IDC, (2) Current capacity of the firm to accomplish the task order in the required time, and (3) Equitable distribution of work among identical contracts. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541310; size standard $4.5 million. To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the DOD Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov or by contacting the DOD Electronic Commerce Information Center at 1-800-334-3414.</p>
<p>2. PROJECT INFORMATION: Work may consist of preparation of reports, studies, project planning, design criteria, preparation of drawings and specifications, cost estimates, and other general A-E services for multi-disciplined new construction and renovation projects for military and other government agencies. The work primarily consists of the design of new vertical construction on facilities commonly found at military installations (barracks, dining facilities, offices, training facilities, equipment maintenance facilities, labs, etc.) as well as horizontal construction projects (airfields, roads, ranges, etc.).&nbsp; Work may consist of completing the designs of Center of Standardization projects.&nbsp; The firm may be required to provide construction phase and other services that may include preparation of operation and maintenance manuals, shop drawing review, and commissioning/start-up/fit-up design support. All design must comply with the Savannah District Design Manual. All drawing files must be delivered in the (*.dgn) format. All drawing files will be developed using the Tri Service AEC Standard, as supplemented by the Savannah District instructions. The standards include naming convention, file and directory structure, line weights, levels, and color. Specifications will be produced in SpecsIntact using the Unified Facilities Guide Specifications (UFGS). Responses to Government review comments will be provided on the Corps of Engineers Design Review and Checking System (DrChecks).</p>
<p>3. SELECTION CRITERIA: The selection criteria for this project are listed below in descending order of importance. Proposals will be evaluated on each of the criteria factors listed below. Each factor will be assigned a rating from outstanding to unsatisfactory, based on the risk to the government that the offeror will successfully perform the factor being evaluated. An overall consensus rating will be given to each submission. Award will be made to the firm determined to be most highly qualified. Factors listed below will be rated based on a relative weighting as follows: Significantly More Important - means that the factor is at least two times greater in value than another factor. More Important - means that the factor is greater in value than another factor but less than two times greater. Equal - means that the factor is of the same value or nearly the same as another factor.

<DESC><p>Harris Corporation has been selected to develop the ground system that will support NOAA's next generation geostationary satellite series, GOES-R. This new series of spacecraft, set to begin launching in 2015, is expected to double the clarity of today's satellite imagery and provide at least 20 times more atmospheric observations from space. The contract, which has an estimated value of $735,794,197 (inclusive of options), requires Harris to design, develop, test and implement the GOES-R ground system. Once completed, it will be one of the most advanced ground-based, satellite systems ever created. The ground system will capture data from the GOES-R satellites, and process and distribute the information to operational users as fast as 23 seconds, unlike today's ground system, which takes over 1 minute.</p>
