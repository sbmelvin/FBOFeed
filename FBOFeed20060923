<DESC>This announcement is a Market Survey.  This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR).  Furthermore, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA has a need to improve safety of Part 135 On-Demand Air Carriers.  The Part 135 operating community has a fatal accident rate significantly higher than the rate enjoyed by the commercial airline community (Part 121). Several environmental factors affect this difference, including the lower aircraft performance requirements of Part 135, lower airport standards and the nature of on demand versus scheduled service.   The FAA is surveying the marketplace to see the extent of interest and capability in meeting the requirements outlined in the attached Statement of Work.  The result of this program is to provide proactive tools for industry participants to prevent accidents and to improve and measure safety management by Part 135 on-demand air carriers. All responses (one response per company) are to be provided on company letterhead and limited to a total of 10 typewritten pages.  No type font less than 12-point may be used. Furthermore, the vendor must submit a completed copy of the Business Declaration Form. The response must be submitted via e-mail to the Contracting Officer, Sarah Scott, at Sarah.Scott@faa.gov.  Due to the urgency of this requirement, responses must be received no later than 11:00 AM local time 27 September 2006.   All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative cost incurred associated with any response to this Market Survey announcement.  Therefore, any costs associated with this Market Survey submission will be solely at the interested party's expense.

Daily access procedures must not be used to circumvent background check requirements outlined below.  Attempts to improperly use daily access procedures may result in denial of access to the involved employees.  2.   Business Access:  Required for contractor employees requiring access for periods from one day to one year.  Submit the following:   •	A valid form of Federal or state government I.D. •	If driving a motor vehicle, a valid driver's license, vehicle registration and proof 	of insurance. •	Proof of employment on a valid Government contract (e.g., a letter from the 	prime contractor including contract number and term). •	Proof of an employee background check conducted within the past year 	covering the previous two years.  Contractor employee background checks are 	conducted at contractor expense.  The background check: (a)	must establish the employee's citizenship or legal alien status.  Acceptable documents include birth certificate, Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) forms and passports. (b)	must include proof of a criminal records check from the county or state where the employee resided for the previous two years (or length of legal residence for foreign nationals in the U.S. for less than two years).   (c)	will be subject to Government verification via the FBI National Crime Information Center (NCIC) Interstate Identification Index (III).  If the background check is selected for  verification, the employee will be required to submit fingerprint records to the FBI Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) database.  NCIC checks and fingerprinting will be performed at Government expense. Note: All contractor personnel performing work under this contract requiring access to the military installation shall obtain personal entry and a vehicle pass from the Provost Marshal’s Office (PMO)  of the Combat Center.  For the MCAGCC/MAGTFTC, this process includes the completion of a COMBAT CENTER ACCESS AUTHORITY letter issued by the Regional Contracting Office (NW).   3.  Permanent Business Access:  Required for contractor employees requiring access for periods from one to three years.  Submit all items listed above under “business access.”  NCIC check and fingerprint of all contractor employees will be conducted at Government expense.  Contractor-provided background checks will be reevaluated annually, and will be updated by the contractor as required at the contractor’s expense. 4.  Emergency Access:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures which allow the contractor quick access without compromising installation security for situations in which contractor response is crucial in order to preserve and/or restore critical facilities.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.   5.  Installation Access Badges:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures for readily identifying contractor employees working on the installation.  The installation may either provide access badges to individual contractor employees at government expense or it may require the contractor to provide badges to its employees, at its expense.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.   6.  Denial of Access:  The Commanding General of each installation has broad authority to remove or exclude any person in fulfilling his responsibility to protect personnel and property, to maintain good order and discipline, and to ensure the successful and uninterrupted performance of the Marine Corps mission.  In the exercise of this authority, the Commanding General may refuse to grant access or may bar contractor employees, including employees who have previously been granted access.  Refusal to grant an employee access or barment of an employee does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue performance under this contract.  Among other reasons, access may be denied if it is determined that an employee: 	a.    is on the National Terrorist watch List. 	b.    is illegally present in the United States. c.	is subject to an outstanding warrant. d.	has knowingly submitted an employment questionnaire with false or fraudulent  information. 	e.    has been issued a debarment order and is currently banned from military installations. 7.  Employee Identification:  Contractor personnel performing work under this contract shall be readily identifiable as an employee of the contractor through the use of uniforms or nametags, or via an alternate method approved by the Contracting Officer.  8.  Employee Compliance.  The Contractor’s employees shall observe and comply with all MCAGCC/MAGTFTC rules and regulations applicable to contract personnel, including those applicable to the safe operation of vehicles, and shall not be present in locations not required for the proper performance of this contract. Contractor personnel and equipment entering a military installation are subject to security checks. Contractor personnel shall follow any direction given by military police, law enforcement, or other security or safety personnel. 9.  Contract Termination:  The Contractor is responsible for ensuring clearances, permits, passes, or security badges are promptly returned to the issuing activity upon termination of an employee, completion of a project, or termination of a contract or subcontract.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:     The Government announces with this PRESOLICITATION MODIFICATION that the action office for this effort will be changed from the Gulf Region Division, Central District (Baghdad Iraq) to a CONUS-based office to be identified.  As such, the solicitation number will change.  This requirement WILL  NOT be issued under W917BG-06-R-0305.  Because the action office is changing, the acquisition strategy may change as well.  Issue date of solicitation, solicitation number and responsible Contracting Specialist/Contracting Officer at new action office is unknown at this time. ESTIMATED revised date of solicitation issue is now 25 October 2006.

FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition. The selected Offeror must submit a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items. FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. The following FAR clauses in paragraph (b) of FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, will apply: 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, 52.232-34. The full text of a FAR clause may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far. CCR Requirement - Company must be registered on Central Contractor Registration (CCR) before an award could be made to them. If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the EMC DMX3000. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST requires the EMC DMX3000 Networked Storage System. CA currently runs the EMC DMX3000 at its primary site in Beltsville. This purchase will allow CA to form the redundant site at the Harry S Truman Building (Main State). Data will be replicated between Beltsville and Main State; therefore, hardware and software compatibility will be a major part of the requirement. The purchase of the EMC DMX3000 will ensure compatibility and will best meet CA’s needs. Also, the continued use of the EMC DMX3000, rather than to introduce another manufacturer’s product, is cost effective. The use of one make and model eliminates the need to purchase, maintain and account for inventories of spare parts and software for multiple networked storage systems. In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested EMC DMX3000 without delay. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the EMC DMX3000 because results obtain by the Bureau’s Data Engineering Task Team in evaluations and reviews of other manufacturers’ tape libraries indicated that this networked storage system most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements. NO SUBSTITUTIONS.  NEW ITEMS ONLY. A)Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec)  B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging. C)  Seller is providing these products via DELL authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales.  D) Full DELL warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components.

FOB DESTINATION CONUS The Department is moving in the direction of using frequent, local, disk-based snapshots for quick recovery of lost or damaged files or e-mails, which will reduce the need for off-site transport of backups for disaster recovery purposes (as required in 12 FAM 622.3).  The price of tape drives as now deployed by GITM for this purpose , and GITM deploys one drive for each of three servers plus a spare,  plus the cost of media.  Removable hard drives, on the other hand, consist of a carrier  and a removable drive.  In the recommended model of making weekly off-site backups (not daily), this reduces the cost significantly, while also greatly improving post's ability to quickly recover files and e-mails from the on-site snapshots. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the Tandberg RDX Removable Hard Drive system as the only one available in the market today that meets the Department's requirements for low cost, capacity, performance, and ease of use in the backup model described in (2) above.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s enterprise backup system.
