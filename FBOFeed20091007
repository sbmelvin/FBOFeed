Electronic Systems Center (ESC) is seeking information in support of market research being conducted by the United States Air Force (USAF), ESC, 653d Electronic Systems Wing/853d Electronic Systems Group Foreign Military Sales Division to assess the capability to procure, field, install, integrate and sustain Air Traffic Control (ATC) Tower equipment for Taji and Tikrit Air Bases, Iraq.  This ATC Tower equipment, as defined below, is necessary to establish operational control towers at Tikrit and Taji Air Bases.  All this equipment must be carefully integrated into the new towers, being constructed by the US Army Corps of Engineers, both during the tower design and construction phases.  This will enable United States Government (USG) to deliver turn-key operational control towers for the Iraqi Air Force.
This RFI identifies the equipment requirements necessary to provide 24 hour ATC tower support for Visual Flight Rules (VFR) and Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) operations for fixed and rotary wing aircraft at Tikrit and Taji Air Bases, Iraq.  This ATC tower equipment will be capable of supporting all Iraqi Air Force inventory aircraft and a variety of coalition aircraft in all weather conditions.  
The ATC tower equipment will be capable of providing VFR, Special VFR, and IFR departure and IFR arrival services to fixed and rotary wing aircraft.  The ATC tower display equipment will include up to six (6) ATC positions consisting of, but not limited to: one (1) Local Controller position, one (1) Flight Data position, one (1) Clearance Delivery position, one (1) Ground Controller position, (1) Supervisor of Flight position and one (1) Watch Supervisor position.  The ATC tower equipment suite will include the automation system.  The ATC tower equipment will be able to communicate via Very High Frequency/Ultra High Frequency (VHF/UHF) voice radio transceivers to aircraft operating within the terminal airspace and to those operating on the airfield.  There will be VHF and UHF radio transceivers to support ATC operations.  These radio transceivers will be connected to the cab positions via the Voice Communications Switching System (VCSS) Touch Entry Devices (TED).  The VHF ca! pability must include 8.33 kHz and 25 kHz channel spacing, be operator selectable, and the UHF capability must include 25 kHz channel spacing.  In addition to the radio transceivers, remote control units, antennas, cabling, and additional ancillary equipment to support communications will be provided.  Additional VHF/UHF tunable radios will also be provided as an emergency backup.
The ATC tower equipment will interface with its servicing radar approach control or enroute center via landline communications and automated flight data management systems.  It will interface with a servicing weather station and communicate with that same weather station via landline/radio communications.  It will also interface via radio/land mobile radio with vehicles that must operate on the airfield.  This equipment will connect to a dedicated landline system that allows prompt notification to base agencies of aircraft emergency and accident notification.  
The ATC tower automation system will consist of but not limited to the following: ATC display automation processors, radar data processors, flight data processors, serial interface communications processors, a Local Area Network (LAN), data recording and playback capability, ATC software, and a VCSS.  It provides the ATC tower processing capability for both ATC automation and Radar Approach Control systems and is connected directly via the LAN.  The VCSS will provide the ATC Tower and Radar Approach Control system positions with voice and landline connectivity. The VCSS will include TEDs and headsets at ATC supervisor and controller positions.
The following services are also required in order to ensure that ATC tower functions are maintained at an optimum level in the new control towers as defined below.  All documents shall be provided in English. 
a.  Serve as overall system integrator to ensure that an operational ATC Tower can be commissioned at both Tikrit and Taji Air Bases.

NSF has appointed an ombudsman to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and contractors in the conduct of its acquisition activities. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the contracting officer, the Source Evaluation Board, or the selection official.

Therefore, before consulting with any ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations in writing to the contracting officer for resolution. If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, interested parties may contact the ombudsman. Please do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements.

<DESC>Arcata Associates, Inc has a continued requirement for an existing Global TestRange Development Lab supports NASA in the research, engineering, development, andoperation of prototype systems that serve non-traditional range customer groups typicallyinterested in off-range operations. This continued procurement of this effort supportsNASA DFRC project, providing Global Test Range Development Lab and Reveal Development.Arcata Associates, Inc. intends to purchase the items from ERIGO Technologies LLC PO Box899 Enfield, NH 03748 is the only responsible source which is capable of satisfying theagency's unique need for the following reasons:An existing Global Test Range Development Lab supports NASA in the research,engineering, development, and operation of prototype systems that serve non-traditionalrange customer groups typically interested in off-range operations.  The dominantcustomer in this arena is currently the airborne science community (science missiondirectorate), but customers are emerging across NASAs mission directorates as well asother agencies.  As systems mature, the Global Range of the future is envisioned assupport infrastructure for a form of autonomous or adaptive sensor web.  Onsite staffhelp to develop, implement, setup, configure, administer, and test the Global RangeDevelopment Lab.  Current Development Lab capabilities related to network computing infrastructure involveopen source middleware for software integration and distributed streaming data fusioncalled DataTurbine. NASA was instrumental in the development of the source software anduses it as a key component of the acquisition, distribution, and web servicesarchitecture in the Global Test Range.	The prototype implementation of a systemmanagement tool for DataTurbine-based applications is referred to as the IntelligentNetwork Data Server (INDS).On aircraft, NASA has also developed a Linux-based on-board system for facilitatingintegration of instrument payloads with vehicle systems and communication links. TheResearch Environment for Vehicle Embedded Analysis on Linux (REVEAL) systems currentlyserve as onboard data acquisition, processing, and recording systems while also servingas a managed gateway for communication with terrestrial systems.  REVEAL was created as atool for telemetry and measurement networks applications and is currently deployed onseveral airborne platforms.   Long term plans currently include expanded use ofinterfaces and protocols based on open standards, and releasing REVEAL under an opensource license.  The Global Test Range Development Lab requires the ability to expand its capacity to doengineering research, development, and technology maturation. Schedule risk will besignificantly reduced due to Erigo Technologies LLC engineering and manufacturingexpertise and capabilities with the Data Turbine Based Operations and Reveal Development. This expertise is critical to ensure continued success..  For example, only ErigoTechnologies LLC can provide instant response to resolve problems and assistance with thecommunications systems that support the missions required for these experiments.  Thus,programmatic and schedule risk are significantly reduced.Erigo Technologies LLC has gained experience in the modification and operation of theData Turbine Based Operations and Reveal development over countless hours.  This makesthem uniquely experienced to support NASA research modifications and flight operations,and provide training support.  Any other company would have to invest hundreds ofthousands of hours to develop a similar experience level.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 2:30 p.m. PacificStandard Time on October 22, 2009. Such cabilities/qualifications will be evaluatedsolely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on acompetitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed efforton a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solelywithin the discretion of the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

Located at the edge of a residential community, the Center houses 280 trainees; there is an additional 137 non-resident trainees who arrive for training each morning.  The facility occupies approximately 40 acres and utilizes about 130 acres for the Heavy Equipment Training Program.     

The program meets the needs of each individual in four (4) specific areas that enable the trainee to become successfully employed.  Although many other needs are also being met, the program focuses on building vocational skills, developing academic skills and increasing awareness of social skills and core values.

Besides educational and vocational opportunities, trainees receive housing, meals, medical and dental care, as well as living and clothing allowances.  There are daily recreational activities and outings scheduled weekly for all trainees who wish to participate.  Counseling services are available to assist trainees with their individual needs.

<a href="mailto:princess.cannon@faa.gov">princess.cannon@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>Background:The System Wide Information Management Program (SWIM) will use Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) principles in designing and specifying NAS Air Traffic Management (ATM) services.  The FAA is seeking an XML Gateway that meets the Government's requirements to help ensure that the opportunities and benefits of SOA are achieved. 
Purpose:This is a market survey for the SWIM XML Gateway Qualified Vendor's List. This is not a Screening Information Request or Request for Proposal of any kind. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey. Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors' expense.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined. The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set-aside on all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) program. The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from interested business concerns, including SBA certified 8(a) firms and other small business concerns, capable of providing standard, commercial XML Gateways which meets the Government's requirements. 
Furthermore, this survey will aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside part or all of the competition amongst eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program, and other small businesses such as Women Owned businesses and Service Disabled Veteran businesses or whether it is more appropriate to conduct this procurement as a full and open competition. 
Requirements:In order to make the determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside part or all of the competition amongst eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses the FAA requires a Capability Statement from interested vendors. The Capability Statement should address your firm's technical capability to provide the product and services described in the Requirements Document. Limited to four(4) pages, it should include the following:1.	A list of similar projects undertaken.  For each project cited, please provide the following information: Name of project, Contract number, Customer Name, Brief Description of project or services/XML Gateway product provided, start and end dates, and any other relevant information.2.	Expected programmatic approach, i.e., in-house, teaming, or subcontracting. If your organization is an eligible 8(a) certified business or other small business, please provide the percentage of work to be completed by the 8(a) or small business respondent.  3.	If applicable, a list of all teaming partners with a description of each partner's responsibility. 4.	Business Declaration Form (see attachment).5.	If applicable, Small Business or 8(a) certification letter.
To help you determine if your company is qualified to provide XML Gateway and services necessary for this requirement, the FAA is making available a DRAFT Requirements Document and Qualification Information Request (QIR). The Government welcomes substantive comments on both documents. Please submit comments together with the Capability Statement described above. There is no page limit on comments.  
Contact Information:The FAA prefers that all responses, questions, and/or comments, including attachments, be submitted electronically to the following address:  princess.cannon@faa.gov.  All responses to this market survey must be received no later than October 19, 2009, 12:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time. 
Princess Cannon, Contract SpecialistEmail: princess.cannon@faa.govPhone: 202.493.4634
Follow-up Activity (if any):Note:  The final Requirements Document and QIR are expected to be posted to the FAA Contract Opportunities Website on November 2, 2009 with a response date of November 23, 2009.

The USFWS is seeking one or several Contractor operated and maintained aircraft with pilots needed for the transportation of Government personnel and/or cargo originating from Honolulu, HI.

The primary need for aircraft is to provide logistical support to the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge from Honolulu however additional support to other locations in the Pacific may also be serviced through the potential contract.  Midway lies 1250 miles northwest of Honolulu, Hawaii.  A potential hazard that must be considered is the presence of nesting colonies of seabirds on the island.  Approximately 2 million albatross may be present from November through July.  Other birds such as bonin petrels, white tern, black noddies, frigates and boobies are also present in substantial numbers during much of the year.  During the months of November through July most flights are at night to avoid birds strikes.  At a minimum aircraft must have a standard airworthiness certificate, seating for 19 passengers (removable for optional cargo hauling), a range of at least 1300 nautical miles, payload of 5000 pounds (with fuel for specified range), cruising airspeed of 250 KTS, and be capable of operating from a 7,900 ft paved runway at sea level at ISA +15 degrees with payload and fuel.  Freight may include food, diving gear, outboard motors, diesel engines, radio antennas, equipment parts, personal goods, mail, and maintenance equipment.  Over night stays at Midway Atoll may be required.  Aircraft and pilots must be certified and checkrided in IFR extended over water operations.  Certification at least under 14 CFR, Chapter 135, Air Taxi Operators and Commercial Operators is required.  Applicable NAICS code is 481211, Nonscheduled Charter Air Transportation.  It is a requirement that the successful awardee be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). The solicitation will be posted here as well as http://amd.nbc.gov under "Current Solicitations" under Business Opportunities.  The solicitation is unrestricted.
The solicitation is anticipated to be released September 18, 2009 closing October 16, 2009. Interested parties capable of performing this requirement or with questions should call Matt DeLong at 208-433-5029 or send an e-mail response to: Matt_DeLong@nbc.gov

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ intends to procure a Multi-Function Display (MFD) System in support of PMS 500?s DDG 1000 Program.  The tasks cover design, fabrication, testing and delivery of the production representative model, as well as support for integration, installation and checkout.  Upon successful completion of developmental test, integration test and first article test the Government may exercise contract options for production and fielding of seven systems and spares.  A competitive 100% Small Business Set Aside is anticipated.
The MFD program objective is the acquisition and initial support of an integrated display that will provide three different visual cues for day and night helicopter operations on DDG 1000 class ships.  The visual cues integrated into the MFD include the flight deck status display, a horizon reference display and an Aircraft-Ship Integrated Secure and Traverse (ASIST) System position display.  The MFD will communicate with the Total Ship Computing Environment Infrastructure (TSCEI) Network through redundant Distributed Adaptation Processors (DAPs) to receive ship?s roll stabilization signals from NAVDDX and to update settings such as deck status and lighting intensity to accommodate a variety of meteorological and lighting conditions for flight operations.  The system will be controlled by command signals from a remote operator.  The operator interface will be a Common Electronic Display (CED) provided by the ship builder and located in the Helicopter Control Station (HCS).  Commands will be received by the MFD via the TSCEI and DAPs.  Emergency operation and maintenance capability will be provided via a hard-wired maintenance control panel provided as part of the system.  The MFD program will involve designing, building and testing a production representative system in order to achieve the objectives set forth in the DDG 1000 Operational Requirements Document (ORD) and to demonstrate conformance to the MFD System Specification with the option to purchase production systems.  The MFD contract is a portion of the next generation suite of Visual Landing Aids which will be incorporated into the DDG 1000.
A Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued to the companies that respond to the FedBizOpps synopsis, as well as those companies on the solicitation mailing list.  Because the specifications and drawings are subject to Export Control Laws, the companies are required to register with the United States/Canada Joint Certification Office through the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), and provide a copy of their executed DD Form 2345 to the contracting office before a copy of the solicitation package is mailed.  It is mandatory to register with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database.  The CCR provides the DUNS (Data Universal Numbering System + 4 number) number and a company?s CAGE (Commercial and Government Entity) code that will be required to conduct business with the Department of Defense.

<a href="mailto:niedermier.annette@epamail.epa.gov">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 235   In accordance with FAR Part 13 and FAR Part 12, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory located in Ann Arbor, Michigan is seeking to procure a Structural Mezzanine to replace and to raise the existing 4" metal ceiling panelsin test cell D514.
The EPA NVFEL has undertaken a comprehensive research program to implement new hydraulic hybrid vehicle technology that improves fuel economy and lowers emissions.  Some of the test vehicles are too high to fit in the existing dynamometer test cell that is 120" high.  In order to better utilize the test cell, the existing metal panel ceiling will be removed and replaced with a structural mezzanine that will provide the required clear height and improve the space utilization on both the ground floor and the new second level.
The NVFEL building has 240" of space up to the bottom of the 48" steel roof girders.  Many NVFEL test cells are 120" high with 4" metal wall and ceiling panels.  The remaining second level space has been utilized in several test sites to good advantage by adding structural mezzanines, which can also provide load capacity to install heavy equipment in close proximity to the actual test vehicle.  EPA has developed a design for a structural mezzanine over rooms D514 and 512 and a scope of work to renovate these areas.
The contractor shall provide and incorporate the means to meet the specific requirements of the Scope of Work for the D514 as outlined in general below:
o	Provide a project plan that will complete the renovation in minimal test cell downtime.
o	Provide construction/demolition services to remove the existing ceiling and duct connections to building services as needed to open the space for the mezzanine installation.  Ceiling panels and steel supports being removed shall be temporarily stored for some specific later reuse.
o	Provide for the fabrication, delivery, and installation of the structural mezzanine (nominally 25'x40'x13') within D514.  This mezzanine structure shall be built to support second level loads at a minimum uniform total load rating of 150 PSF.  Ingress and egress paths from adjacent areas shall be modified to integrate with the new mezzanine via small staircase units.  The mezzanine project shall meet the specific requirements detailed and illustrated in separate documents.
o	Provide for the fabrication, delivery, and installation of components that will reconfigure the ductwork from the RTU-37 roof top air handler to enable even distribution and recirculation of 8000 cfm of conditioned air.  Provide for extending and supporting the metal wall panels and sealing any exposed areas to create an acceptably air tight enclosure for the purpose of the FM-200 fire suppression system.
oProvide an option and separate bid to extend this mezzanine deck over the adjacent control room about 10' to butt to a drywall partition.  This deck shall be covered with removable 19W4 x 1.25" bargrates to facilitate access to the components below the deck but above the 4" metal panel ceiling.  The bargrates also allow the sprinkler system to cover this area.  The structural supports used for the D514 mezzanine beams shall incorporate the means to add the 512 beams without any modifications.
EPA's requirements have been specified in detail for a mezzanine that will be installed in the room D514 at the EPA National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  
The renovated test cell and mezzanine shall conform to the requirements specified in the procurement Scope of Work.  For the structure specified, the contractor shall be responsible for all phases of the project - verification and certification of the specified design layout, removal and discarding of the existing ceiling, fabrication of mezzanine components, delivery to EPA-NVFEL, assembly and installation, and documentation of the project.  The contractor shall be responsible for documenting compliance with any applicable building codes.
This procurement will be competed using full and open competitive procedures under NAICS code 423830 with a size standard of 100 employees. Award will be made using "Best Value" evaluation criteria.  The solicitation should be issued around October 22, 2009.  Interested parties should submit a written request via e-mail to receive the RFP, Statement of Work and associated documents.  E-mail requests shall be sent to the Contract Specialist at niedermier.annette@epa.gov with "Mezzanine" in the subject line.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The CAT:UT will provide hardware and software maintenance and development for the ExCIS FSA in support USAOTCs operational testing requirements.  The ExCIS FSA software is the instrumentation package used to simulate and stimulate current and future U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps field artillery (FA) and fire support (FS) systems using the Field Artillery Tactical Data Systems (FATDS) and Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) devices.  The CAT:UT is the sole developer and producer of the ExCIS FSA software and is the only known company capable of fulfilling the ExCIS FSA requirements.  To award any other source would most likely result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. The Period of Performance is a Base plus four options. The NAICS code is 541990 with size standard of  $7.0 million. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of  FAR 6.302-1.

However, the Government will only consider the proposals received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be used only for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  All responsible sources may identify interest and capability by responding to this requirement or submit a proposal. All respondents must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), and have a valid DUNS number, Cage Code, and Tax Identification Number. All responses must be written and sent via electronic mail to amsca.atec@us.army.mil. Government will not accept telephone inquiries or responses.  Numbered notes 22 and 26 at http://cbdnet.gpo.gov/num-note.html apply. The point of the contact for this announcement is Angelic Hatcher, Contract Specialist or Patricia M. Cuff, Contracting Officer.

<p>Azerbaijan: Socar Waste Mangement Facility Project</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to <br />a) evaluate the technical, economic, and financial feasibility of developing a new (or upgraded) waste management facility in Azerbaijan. <br />b) Provide suggestions for the design, construction, and operation of the facility.</p>
<p>SOCAR's current operations generate a wide variety of wastes including drilling mud, oil-contaminated soil, waste oil, tires, formation water, and solid waste such as plastics, wood, and electronic waste. In addition, oil-contaminated soils exist in a great number of locations throughout the Absheron Peninsula which SOCAR plans to remediate. Currently, SOCAR manages a single 45,000 m3 landfill in the Garadagh District that commenced operations in 1985, for the final disposal of a portion of the oil-contaminated soils from remediation and from drilling activities. This six cell landfill, however, has structural flaws (e.g., cracks in the concrete liner) and needs to be replaced. Along with the need to dispose of waste generated from ongoing remediation efforts, one of SOCAR's highest priorities is to establish a new waste management facility (or an upgrade of the existing facility) that will process the wastes from SOCAR operations (past and present) as well as from its approximately 120 subsidiaries.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $572,068 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p>https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

<DESC>Vectren Natural Gas Company (Vectren) supplies odorized natural gas to Wright-Patterson AFB via a Government-wide supply contact administered by Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) through 14 metered delivery points located throughout WPAFB. A regulator, meter and valve station is located at each delivery point. The equipment at each delivery point is owned, operated and maintained by Vectren. In addition to the normal natural gas requirements on Base, the natural gas system also supplies fuel to two compressed natural gas (CNG) facilities for the Base's CNG vehicle fleet. The CNG stations are located in Areas B and C but are specifically excluded from Utility Privatization. <br />Gas distribution pressure ranges from 8 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) to 45-psig. <br />The gas is distributed throughout the Base through approximately 31 miles of underground pipelines. These lines are owned, operated and maintained by the Base, except for some privatized housing service laterals. Many of these lines are polyethylene (PE) pipe with tracer wire. The balance of the pipe is coated and wrapped steel and originally protected by a cathodic protection system utilizing sacrificial anodes. Pipe is typically buried at a minimum of three feet below the surface. The Wright-Patterson AFB gas distribution system has undergone significant replacement projects in the last 20 to 30 years. When it is necessary to add or replace lines, due to new construction or repair, PE pipe is usually the material of choice.<br />A generalized system assessment was conducted with Base engineering, operation and maintenance personnel. For assessment purposes, the Base was subdivided into 14 areas, generally around delivery/meter points and areas of similar age and condition. Base-wide, the coated and wrapped steel pipe system was protected by a cathodic protection system, which utilizes sacrificial anodes unless otherwise noted. Pipe failures do not seem to be a problem in any of the areas. Summaries of the condition assessments are as follows: <br />&bull; Meter Point (MP) 1, serving the northern portion of Area B, was the oldest gas system on Base but has undergone significant upgrades. The coated and wrapped steel pipe was originally installed around 1943 and is thought to be in average to poor condition. Over half of the pipe downstream from this meter point was replaced around 2001. The older plug valves in this area of the system are considered to be in average to poor condition. The 25-&not;psig distribution system pressure is adequate and serves facilities primarily utilized for research. The gas system served by this meter point is an isolated system and is not connected to distribution piping served by other delivery points. <br />&bull; MP 2 is also located in the northern portion of Area B. It serves an incinerator and an occupational health clinic. The pressure for this part of the system has a 25-psig pressure. The coated and wrapped steel pipe and plug valves were installed in 1947 and are thought to be in average condition. Approximately 40 percent of the pipe has been replaced in the last 15 years. This section of the gas system is also isolated from other sections of the distribution system. <br />&bull; MP 3 is located in the north central portion of Area B and serves research facilities. Much of this system was replaced in 1985 and consists of PE pipe and plug valves, which are considered to be in good condition. Piping was installed with tracer wire and warning tape. The distribution pressure in this portion of the system is 40-psig. This is also an isolated gas system. A major replacement project occurred in 2002 replacing lines along Skyline Drive. <br />&bull; MP 4 is located in Area B and serves the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright Field. The polyethylene (PE) pipe and plug valves were installed in 2000 and are considered to be in good condition. The gas pressure is 10-psig. The gas lines were recently extended to serve an additional hangar facility at the museum in 2004. <br />&bull; MP 5 serves The Prairies at Wright Field housing area, located west of Area B. The PE pipe and plug valves were installed in 1984 and upgraded during 2003 in some areas as part of the housing privatization initiative. Tracer wire and warning tape are in place; piping is considered to be good condition with a pressure of 25-psig. This is a looped system and pressure is not a problem. A normally closed Vectren valve is located on the north side of the housing area and provides an emergency backup source of gas for The Prairies housing area. <br />&bull; MP 6 serves only the school in The Prairies housing area with three-inch PE pipe. The gas pressure is 25 psig.<br />&bull; MP 7 (National Road Metering Station) is located on the east side of Area B and serves facilities located along the east boundary of Area B. The coated and wrapped steel pipe and plug valves were installed in 1950 and are considered to be in average condition. This section has a gas pressure of 25-psig. It is estimated that 100 percent of the pipe has been replaced in the last 15 years. As pipe is replaced, it is replaced with PE piping with tracer wire and warning tape. This is another isolated system consisting of several dead-end lines and one gas source serving primarily office buildings. A new childcare center and Air Force Institute of Technology building are also served by this sub-system. <br />&bull; MP 8 serves The Woods at Wright Field housing area, located east of Area B and south of Area C. The PE pipe and plug valves were installed in 1970 and are considered to be in good condition with a gas pressure of 45-psig. No significant sections of pipe have been replaced in the last 15 years. The regulators are considered to be in average condition. This is a looped system and pressure is not a problem. During the installation of the PE pipe, tracer wire and warning tape were not installed which makes locating the pipe extremely difficult and increases the chances of line damage when excavation is taking place in this area. <br />&bull; MP 9 is located on the north edge of The Woods housing area and serves only a heat plant, located near the meter point. The coated and wrapped steel pipe and plug valves were installed in 1991 and are considered to be in excellent condition. The system pressure at the heat plant is 35-psig. The cathodic protection for this section of pipe was also installed in 1991. <br />&bull; MP 10 is located on the south boundary of Area A and serves Area A. The coated and wrapped steel pipe and plug valves were originally installed in 1970 and are considered to be in average condition with a gas pressure of 8-psig. An estimated 25 percent of the pipe has been replaced in the past 15 years. The gas distribution system in this area primarily serves office buildings in the west portion and MFH in the east portion of Area A. Gas lines from Vectren MP 11, serving Area C, are also connected to this distribution system in the Area A Housing. A recent project was completed to replace a section of 4-inch steel piping with 6-inch piping and an upgrade of the regulators serving this section resulting in reduced operational problems. A section line along Communications Blvd. was replaced in 2000. Most recently, the entire system in the housing area known as The Bricks was replaced in 2003 with PE pipe; tracer wire and warning tape was also installed. <br />&bull; MP 11 is located near Gate 35C on the east side of Area C and serves Area C. The PE pipe and plug valves were installed in 1980 and are considered to be in good condition. The distribution pressure in this area of the system is 8-psig and serves a combination of office, industrial, and flight-line hanger facilities. The distribution system in Area C is a looped system and is also interconnected with the distribution system serving Area A, which provides a second source of gas for Area C. No facilities are currently being planned which will significantly increase the gas demand in Area C. <br />&bull; MP 12 is located along the east boundary of Area C and serves the West Ramp Area. In 1993, approximately 3500 linear feet of 6-inch PE pipe was installed from MP12, along the east boundary of Area C and into the West Ramp area. The pipe is considered to be in good condition with a gas pressure of 8-psig, and was installed with tracer wire and warning tape. This is a radial system that is isolated from other systems serving the Installation. <br />&bull; MP 13 is located along the east boundary of the Kittyhawk Center, which is in the northeast portion of the Installation. The coated and wrapped steel lines date back to 1943 and are in poor condition. All pipes in this area were replaced in 1999/2000. This portion of the gas system is isolated from the other distribution systems and serves facilities that range from office to small industrial type facilities. This section of the system has a gas pressure of 8-psig. <br />&bull; MP 14 is located at the southwest corner of the Kittyhawk Center and serves only one heat plant. The 8-inch PE line was installed in 1994 with tracer wire and warning tape and is considered to be in excellent condition. This system is isolated from the other distribution systems.<br />There is currently an active cathodic protection program at the Base. This program is cognizant of many problems in the system such as inadequate insulation unions and flanges, PE pipe sections installed between metal pipes without jumper wires, and old anode beds that cannot be located. The gas distribution system has both sacrificial anode and impressed current cathodic protection systems. Generally, the sacrificial anode systems are associated with steel pipe. Installation technicians are more concerned about sections of steel pipe in Area B, primarily because soil conditions are more corrosive than in Areas A and C. <br />There is no Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system or Energy Monitoring and Control System (EMCS) included in the natural gas privatization package.<br />There are no natural gas components to be privatized at either the Huffman Radar Site or the Kauffman Avenue Switching Station.

<DESC><p>Wright-Paterson AFB receives water from two primary sources: on-base wells and off-base supply from Montgomery County Water District. An emergency supply is also available from the City of Fairborn.<br />The Mad River Aquifer is the primary source of water for the on-base wells at Wright-Patterson AFB. Water quality from all the wells requires on-site treatment and is classified as very hard with a median hardness concentration of 378 milligrams per liter (mg/l), as reported in the 1994 Long-Range Water Plan. High Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) levels are also present, with most wells exceeding the 500 mg/l TDS Secondary Maximum Contaminant Level (SMCL) set by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA). The wells currently used are generally below the 0.3 mg/l OEPA SMCL for iron and 0.05 mg/l OEPA SMCL for manganese. <br />The active wells with finished depth ranging from about 50 to 90 feet provide the primary supply for potable water and fire protection. Originally constructed in the early 1940s, the wells have received periodic upgrades with the most recent major project occurring in 1994/1995. This project replaced motors and pumps in each of the wells with submersible pumps ranging from 40 to 125 horsepower (HP). All wells are metered at the wellhead and nine wells are located inside dedicated structures primarily constructed of brick or cinder block. The wellheads for Nos. 8 and 9, in addition to the inactive wells, are located underground and do not have dedicated buildings. <br />Wells in each area supply the individual water needs for their respective distribution systems. Areas A and C are adjacent to each other, Area B is separated from Areas A and C by a major state highway, State Route (SR) 444. The Woods at Wright Field housing area is supplied from Area B and The Prairies at Wright Field housing area is served by water purchased from Montgomery County.<br />Secondary water sourcing for Areas A and C is provided by the City of Fairborn through two six-inched metered lines connecting to the east side of Area C near Gate 35C. <br />Area A is serviced by two wells, Wells 8 and 9, which have a maximum combined production capacity of 1,900 gallons per minute (gpm) or 2.74 million gallons per day (mgd). These wells are located in underground vaults and share an emergency back-up generator. Area B is serviced by four wells, Well nos. 1, 2 (well 2 has two pumps 2a &amp;2b, which share the same well), 4 and 5, which have a maximum combined production capacity of 6,400 gpm or 9.3 mgd. However, Area B treatment capacity is limited to 4,000 gpm or 5.8 mgd. Area B wells each have dedicated well house structures. Area C is serviced by four wells, Well nos. 1, 2, 3 and 7, which have a maximum combined capacity of 3,400 gpm or 4.90 mgd. Area C wells also have dedicated well house structures.<br />The East Wellfield is located in Area C but serves Area B and contains Wells A, B, E and F, which are currently not in operation due to high levels of iron, manganese, total dissolved solids and relative hardness. The East Wellfield has significant potential productivity with a rated combined pumping capacity of 7,330 gpm or 10.5 mgd. Wells A, B, C, E and F are located in underground vaults. These wells are included as part of the UP solicitation and could be incorporated into the active system at a future date, with appropriate treatment, to meet any increase in demand but are currently limited by Area B treatment capacity.<br />Water Treatment <br />Each of the three Areas of the Base (Areas A, B and C) has a separate water treatment facility. The Areas use the same treatment processes and are operated in the same manner. The treatment process performs the following functions: <br />&bull; VOC removal<br />&bull; Scaling control<br />&bull; Disinfection<br />&bull; Fluoridation<br />&bull; Softening (for family housing areas)</p>
<p>Water Storage <br />Wright-Patterson AFB has a mixture of ground level and elevated water storage facilities in each area of the installation. As with other elements of the distribution systems, each area independently operates its own pumps, ground level storage and elevated storage. All of the pump houses have electrically powered pumps for normal daily usage. Each elevated storage tank uses impressed current cathodic protection.<br />Area A storage is provided by two ground storage reservoirs and the elevated Tower 6. The ground storage reservoirs consist of two 375,000 gallon circular, concrete facilities originally constructed in 2009. These reservoirs are co-located with the Area A air strippers and share a fenced enclosure. Tower 6 is a 250,000 gallon elevated steel tank constructed in 1984 and last painted in 1997. <br />Area B storage is provided by three ground storage reservoirs and three elevated steel tanks. The ground storage reservoirs consist of three circular, concrete facilities of 250,000, 300,000 and 370,000-gallon capacity. Two were originally constructed in 1943, roofs were added in 1997. The third 300,000 gallon reservoir was constructed in 2009 with the 1997 roof reinstalled on it. These reservoirs are located near the Area B pumping station. "High Service" Tower 8 serves the high pressure zone and has a 250,000 gallon capacity. "Fire Towers" 2 and 9 serve the domestic water system and have a 500,000 and 200,000 gallon capacity, respectively. <br />Area C storage is provided by one ground storage reservoir, No. 6, the elevated Tower 7 and "SAC" Tower 10. Consisting of a circular, concrete 300,000-gallon ground storage tank, Reservoir 6 was originally constructed in 1949 and a new roof was added in 1997. Tower 7 is a 200,000-gallon elevated steel tank constructed in 1996. Tower 10 is a 150,000-gallon elevated steel tank constructed in 1960 and last painted in 1997. <br />Net storage capacity includes 1.0 million gallons (MG) in Area A, 1.87 MG in Area B, and 0.65 MG in Area C for a total Base-wide storage capacity of 3.52 MG.<br />Water Distribution <br />The original distribution system was constructed in the 1940s (with some pipe installed prior to the 1940s) using cast iron as the dominant pipe material. Newer lines are ductile iron or PVC pipe. Small amounts of other pipe materials are present in smaller diameters. Depth of burial of distribution lines ranges from four to eight feet. Generally, tracer wire or marker tape has not been effectively installed with non-metallic pipe during initial installation or replacement projects. <br />The water system for Areas A and C are usually operated independently. A small four-inch main connecting the two areas is normally open; however, this provides minimal hydraulic interconnection. Other larger interconnecting water mains are normally kept closed but could be opened should the need arise. <br />The Area A distribution system was originally constructed in the 1940s, is primarily cast iron pipe, and is considered to be in average condition. The system is generally looped with a few dead-end lines. <br />Area A Pumping Station 10855 consists of three 150 hp pumps capable of pumping 6,900 gpm. One pump is a variable frequency drive (VFD) pump able to pump directly into the distribution system. The pumps were last replaced in 2001. This building also contains the water lab for sample testing. The facility has an on-site, 450 kW back-up generator installed in 2001.<br />The Area C distribution system was originally constructed in the 1940s and originally consisted of cast iron pipe. Base maintenance personnel rate the distribution system to be average. 30-40% of the pipe and 40-50% of the valves have been replaced in the past 20 years.<br />Area C Pumping Station 30172 consists of three 100 hp pumps, one of which is a back-up, capable of pumping 3,000 gpm. Three 225 hp dedicated fire pumps are also located in this building and are included in the utility privatization solicitation. The domestic pumps were installed in 1989. <br />The Area B distribution system was originally constructed in the 1940s. The distribution piping consists of a mixture of cast iron, asbestos cement, and PVC. Base maintenance personnel rate the distribution system in Area B as being in good condition. <br />Area B Pumping Station 20085a consists of two 150 hp pumps (with a third back up pump) capable of pumping 2,000 gpm feeding the High Zone and two 50 hp pumps capable of pumping 3,500 gpm feeding the Low Zone. One pump in the High Zone is a VFD pump able to pump directly into the distribution system. The pumps were last replaced in 1996. The facility has a 500 kW back-up generator installed in 1996. <br />Pump Stations<br />The East Wellfield, currently inactive, is connected to the Area B reservoirs via a 24-inch pipe which crosses SR 444. While the East Wellfield is located in Area C, there is no existing connection between these wells and either Area A or Area C. <br />The Kittyhawk and West Ramp distribution systems were originally installed around 1955 using cast iron pipe. Base maintenance personnel rate the systems to be in average condition. The fire pressure at the West Ramp is less than the pressure in the other areas of the Base due to its distance from the Main Base. <br />Two housing areas on the perimeter of the Main Base are The Prairies and The Woods. While Wright-Patterson AFB owns and maintains the water distribution systems serving these areas, The Prairies receive their water from the Montgomery County Water District. The Woods receives its water from the Area B water system. Numerous projects have been completed in The Prairies over recent years through housing privatization projects causing the replacement and relocation of parts of the distribution system. The service laterals in these two housing areas are no longer owned by the Air Force and are excluded from the utility privatization solicitation and some of the distribution mains in the Prairies are excluded.<br />Wright-Patterson AFB has no Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system or Energy Monitoring Control System (EMCS) to be included in the water distribution system privatization package. <br />GSUs<br />Huffman Radar Site has a domestic-sized water well, pump, pressure tank, and connecting piping that provides for the site's minimal water requirements. Kauffman Avenue 69kV Switching Station has no water components.</p>

<DESC>The wastewater collection system at Wright-Patterson AFB consists of collection piping, manholes, cleanout T's and lift stations. There is no wastewater treatment facility at the Base. All wastewater generated at WPAFB is treated by either the City of Dayton or the City of Fairborn. The City of Dayton treats most of the wastewater from WPAFB. <br />The wastewater generated in the West Ramp area and all Facilities north and west of the intersection of Skeel Avenue and Xenia Drive, except for Facilities 30138, 30140, and 30143, flows into the City of Fairborn mains that run through the north side of the Base. Wastewater from Buildings 891 and 892 and any overflow from Lift Station 31440 flow into the City of Fairborn line that enters WPAFB near the intersection of State Highway Route 444 and Davis-Monthan Road. The wastewater flows are not metered regularly, and the City of Fairborn charges WPAFB a contracted fee based on estimated flow. The wastewater quantity is calculated from 100% of the potable water usage. <br />All wastewater from the other areas of WPAFB is conveyed to the City of Dayton. The wastewater collection system transports the effluent to two (2) main discharge points adjacent to the west of Area B. Wastewater from Areas A and C is pumped by Lift Station 30117 into a 20-inch 12,300-foot HDPE force main that proceeds southwest along Novick Road. Force main 1440 from Area A and force main 7000 from the Woods MFH (formerly Woodland Hills MFH) feed into this 20-inch main. Wastewater from Area C buildings between Communications Boulevard and Davis-Monthan Road is served by Lift Station 31440. Lift Station 31440 pumps the wastewater through an eight-inch force main into the 20-inch force main. Woods MFH area wastewater flows to Lift Station 27000, which pumps across State Route 444 through a six-inch force main into the 20-inch force main of Lift Station 30117. The 20-inch force main, after exiting Area C, discharges to Manhole 29L and from thereon becomes a gravity line. The 20 inch then changes to a 24-inch gravity main. The 24-inch gravity main runs along Springfield Pike and then changes to a back and forth from a 27 inch to a 24 inch (dependent on slope) east of Bong Street. This gravity main is approximately 12,000 feet in total length and terminates in a City of Dayton manhole approximately 200 feet south of Springfield Pike on Smithville Road. A portion of the 20-inch force main and most of the gravity line is outside WPAFB property. The force and gravity lines are operated and maintained by Base personnel and WPAFB has been granted an easement for the line. Wastewater from Area B is conveyed to the City of Dayton through either the above-mentioned 27-inch gravity main, or a 15-inch main that exits the Base approximately 500 linear feet west of Bong Street. The 15-inch main transmits effluent generated from Area B. The wastewater flow is metered for a short test period once every three years by the City of Dayton. The City then bills WPAFB at a negotiated rate based on the metered flow for the next three years. <br />A Montgomery County sewer main (county main) runs along Colonel Glenn Highway north of Prairies MFH area (formerly called the Page Manor MFH area). The wastewater generated in Prairies MFH is discharged to the county main at multiple points on the north boundary. There is another Montgomery County sewer line that runs through the southeast corner of Prairies MFH. Prairies MFH discharges at two other points on this line. The entire flow goes to the City of Dayton for treatment. <br />Lift Stations <br />There are numerous wastewater system lift stations at Wright-Patterson AFB. Three are relatively large lift stations; the rest are smaller lift stations. <br />Lift Station 30117 is located in Area C and was constructed in 1988. The station is a wet well/dry well station. There are three pumps in this station each with a 175 horsepower (hp) motor drive. This lift station pumps the wastewater through a Base-owned 20-inch, 12,300-foot force main to Manhole 29L. The lift station is equipped with a 400 kW emergency generator to power the station during electrical outages. The pumps are automatically controlled by wet well water level, and have an emergency alarm that annunciates in the Energy Management Control System (EMCS) area. <br />Lift Station 27000, located in the Woods MFH area, and was constructed in 2000. It is a wet well station with two 15 hp submersible grinder pumps. The pumps are automatically controlled by the wet well water level. The lift station is equipped with an emergency generator and the emergency alarm signal that is sent to the EMCS system. The station discharges to a six-inch force main which is approximately 1,100 feet long. The force main passes under State Route 444 and discharges into the 20-inch force main from Lift Station 30117. <br />Lift Station 31440 is located in Area C of the Base and was upgraded in 2002. There are two 7.5 hp submersible pumps that operate by rising and falling water surfaces. There are no emergency alarms at the station and no emergency generator at this lift station. The lift station normally pumps through a 370-foot eight-inch force main to the 20-inch diameter force main from Lift Station 30117. If the flows to the station exceed pumping capacity, excess flow is diverted to the Fairborn gravity wastewater main via a 450-foot, 12-inch gravity line. <br />Lift Station 10854 has two submersible pumps and is located in Area A. This lift station has automatic controls with a local emergency alarm and is not equipped with an emergency generator. Lift Stations 30056, 30138, 30143, and 30152 are located in Area C. Lift station 30056 serves several buildings along the flight line while the other lift stations serve individual single facilities. Lift Stations 30056 and 30143 have local alarms; other lift stations do not have alarms. Each lift station has one or two submersible pumps, and do not have alarms nor emergency generators. <br />Wright-Patterson AFB does not have a wastewater Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system or EMCS to be included in the wastewater collection system privatization solicitation.<br />Wastewater Lines <br />The average depth of wastewater pipe at WPAFB is eight feet. Based on the area served, WPAFB wastewater system is sub-divided into eight areas. Each of the areas is discussed below. <br />The Area A wastewater system was installed in 1945. The lines are vitrified clay pipes and are in average condition. In the last 15 years, approximately 10 percent of the pipe has been upgraded by slip-lining, complete replacement, or point repairs. A few of the lines have less than the minimum required slope and a few have sags in the lines between manholes. Area A wastewater mains are flushed and cleaned every two years, or when a backup or stoppage occurs. Within Area A is the Bricks, Green Acres, and Pine Estates MFH areas; in these MFH areas, only the wastewater mains are included in the privatization action as mentioned before. Wastewater mains in the Bricks, Green Acres, and Pine Estates MFH areas are flushed and cleaned every six months, or when a backup or stoppage occurs.<br />Most of the wastewater piping in Area C is vitrified clay, installed in 1945, and is in average condition. Similar to Area A, a portion of the pipe is installed at less than minimum slope and some reaches of the pipe have sags in the line. Within the last 15 years approximately 10 percent of the pipe has been replaced. Area C wastewater mains are flushed and cleaned every two years, or when a backup or stoppage occurs. <br />In the Kittyhawk Center, the lines are vitrified clay pipes that were installed in 1955. Sections of the pipe have less than minimum slope and, in some cases, the sections have sags. In the last 15 years approximately 20 percent of the pipe has been replaced. The lines are considered to be in average condition. <br />The wastewater lines in the West Ramp area are also vitrified clay pipes that were installed in 1955. Within the last 15 years, approximately 20 percent of the pipe has been replaced. Sections of the piping have less than the minimum required slope and a portion of them have sags. The pipes in this area are in average condition. The pipes are flushed and cleaned every two years, or when a backup or stoppage occurs. <br />Area B was the first area constructed on the Base in the 1920s, and some lines in Area B were constructed in the 1940s. Some lines were for new facilities were added in the mid 1990s. The piping material is vitrified clay and it is in poor condition. There are problem areas where the pipe has less than a minimum slope. Within the last 15 years, approximately 5 percent of the pipe has been relined. The mains are flushed and cleaned annually. <br />The wastewater lines in the Prairies MFH area were installed in 1952. The buildings in this area were renovated. Some of the wastewater mains were replaced, some new lines were constructed, some old lines were abandoned and some of the old mains were reused. The older mains are vitrified clay pipes that are considered to be in average condition. Some sections of the pipe have less than minimum slope but the sections do not have any sag. The lines are flushed and cleaned every six months. The wastewater generated in this area is discharged into the Montgomery County sewer line at multiple points along the north side of the MFH area and at two points on the southwest part of this area. Within the Prairies MFH area is a trailer park area that has been abandoned. The wastewater mains in this section are PVC pipe installed in 1979. All sections of the pipe have slopes greater than the minimum requirement and have no sags. The pipes are considered to be in good condition and are flushed annually. As discussed previously, only the old wastewater mains, not installed and owned by the HP contractor, are included in the privatization package.<br />The Woods MFH area wastewater system was installed in 1972 with a combination of clay and PVC piping (approximately 90 percent of the pipe is PVC). The pipe sections are installed with adequate slopes and have no sags. There have been no replacements in the last 15 years. The pipes are flushed annually and are in good condition. As discussed previously, only the wastewater mains are included in the privatization package.<br />Generally, tracer wire or marker tape has not been effectively installed with non-metallic pipe during initial installation or replacement projects. <br />Manholes<br />Manholes are adequately located and are of either concrete or masonry/brick construction. The manholes in all of the WPAFB non-housing areas are in poor condition and the manhole covers are not watertight. The manholes in the Prairies MFH are in average condition; the manholes in Woods MFH area are in good condition. The manholes in these areas have watertight covers and are inspected regularly. Manholes installed prior to 1950 are assumed to be of masonary/brick construction. Manholes installed subsequent to 1950 are assumed to be of pre-cast concrete construction.

<DESC>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is seeking the development and population of a searchable shared central database to house data associated with animal model development and evaluation of medical countermeasures in animals, in support of the Transformational Medical Technologies Initiative (TMTI) program. The TMTI mission is to protect the Warfighter from potent known, naturally emerging and genetically engineered threats by providing a capability that includes rapid response and the development and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensure of medical countermeasures. High priority organisms include hemorrhagic fever viruses and intracellular bacteria on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Category A and B high priority pathogen list.


Information Sought:

TMTI and other government agencies are investing significantly in the development of countermeasures against biothreat agents, and the development of animal models to support FDA licensure of these countermeasures under the Animal Rule.  However, a centralized database to house data associated with all stages of animal model development and evaluation of medical countermeasures in animals is not currently available as a community resource, which may result in duplication and contradiction of investment.

This RFI seeks the development and population of a searchable shared central database open to government, industry, and academia. The database should facilitate comparison of results between different experiments and laboratories, standardization of procedures and techniques, and meta-analysis of the data to serve as a reference point for evaluating novel pathogens and medical countermeasures.  Responses should consider an approach to foster comprehensive data population, ease of use and input and extraction of data, security issues associated with access to the database, and contractual and legal issues associated with intellectual property, maintenance and ownership of the database.  Responses should communicate offeror knowledge of both database development and parameters associated with animal models.


Instructions to Responders:

Sources having the capability and/or concept to meet these requirements are invited to respond to this RFI. Responses should be limited to five (5) pages for any given concept, not including cover page, cover letter and table of contents.

<DESC>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is seeking medical countermeasures that (1) enhance innate and adaptive immunity for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis, or (2) attenuate final common pathways of pathogenesis to reduce the severity of disease, in support of the Transformational Medical Technologies Initiative (TMTI) program. The TMTI mission is to protect the Warfighter from potent known, naturally emerging and genetically engineered threats by providing a capability that includes rapid response and the development of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medical countermeasures.  High priority organisms include hemorrhagic fever viruses and intracellular bacteria on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Category A and B high priority pathogen list.


Information Sought:

Specifically, the program is interested in the discovery and development of pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis that enhance innate and adaptive immunity, effectively priming the immune system to safely respond to unknown, emerging or bioengineered threats. The program is also interested in medical interventions that target host pathways constituting final common pathways of pathogenesis, e.g., attenuation of inflammatory and coagulation cascades to enhance survival. The intended use may be administration as a stand alone or adjunctive therapy. An alternative approach may be the development of supportive therapies to prevent or treat end-organ failure complicating septic shock or vascular endothelial dysfunction, or prevention or treatment of end-organ damage due to diverse etiologies (e.g., trauma, shock, ischemia, radiation; e.g. shock liver, myocardial or cerebral infarction). Solutions from domains outside of biodefense related-research (e.g. HIV, cancer, sepsis, and trauma) are encouraged. Approaches may include new discoveries or repurposing of FDA approved treatments or candidates in late development.

Sources having the capability and/or concept to meet these requirements are invited to respond to this RFI. Responses should be limited to five (5) pages for any given concept, not including cover page, cover letter and table of contents.

<CONTACT>Paul Rogers, Contract Specialist, Email TMTI_validation_data@dtra.mil - Alynne Faughnan, Contracting Officer, Email TMTI_validation_data@dtra.mil
<DESC>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is seeking studies to assess the clinical and immunological impact of select biothreat agents in humans for the purpose of validating animal models used for pre-clinical and pivotal animal efficacy evaluation of medical countermeasures seeking licensure under the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Animal Rule (21 CFR 601.90-95 and 21 CFR 314.600-601) in support of the Transformational Medical Technologies Initiative (TMTI) program. The TMTI mission is to protect the Warfighter from potent known, naturally emerging and genetically engineered threats by providing a capability that includes rapid response and the development and FDA licensure of medical countermeasures. High priority organisms include hemorrhagic fever viruses and intracellular bacteria on the CDC Category A and B high priority pathogen list.


Information Sought:

TMTI currently supports the development of countermeasures against biothreat agents that warfighters may be exposed to, and the development of animal models to support FDA approval of these countermeasures under the Animal Rule.  For animal models to effectively fulfill FDA Animal Rule requirements, it is crucial that they accurately reflect pathogenesis of human disease and are predictive of human response to countermeasures.  However, there is an overall lack of understanding of disease in humans, and clinical and immunological data from human outbreaks, for many of these biothreats. As a consequence, this lack of knowledge of human disease could pose the most significant obstacle to the advancement and licensure of any candidate countermeasure.  

This RFI seeks study designs to collect and assess clinical data to determine the clinical and immunological impact of infection with select biothreat agents on the CDC Category A and B high priority pathogen list for the purpose of validating animal models used for pre-clinical and pivotal animal efficacy evaluation of medical countermeasures seeking licensure under the FDA Animal Rule.  Responses should consider existing facilities and ongoing programs to collect clinical data from patients with suspected or proven endemic and epidemic disease; controls required to ensure that data collected to support the validation of animal models will be acceptable to the FDA; existing laboratory specimens from patients and matched control groups; regulations and policies governing transport and/or on-site analysis of clinical samples; the impact of basic interventions and supportive therapies on the clinical disease course; and requirements of oversight organizations such as Institutional Review Boards.  Clinical data may include but not be limited to the evolution of symptoms, signs, and clinical course. Laboratory parameters to be studied may include but not be limited to clinical hematology, clinical chemistry, measurements of cytokine profiles and other host biomarkers, viral load, and imaging.


Instructions to Responders:

Sources having the capability and/or concept to meet these requirements are invited to respond to this RFI. Responses should be limited to five (5) pages for any given concept, not including cover page, cover letter and table of contents. Any proprietary concepts of information should be clearly identified as such. Submitted data and information will not be returned. Input on technical aspects of the responses may be solicited by DTRA from non-government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.

<DESC>Research and Development (R &amp; D) Sources Sought Notice
<p>Introduction<br /><br />This is a Research and Development (R &amp; D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R &amp; D requirement.<br /><br />Background<br /><br />The Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) supports basic, translational, and clinical research to understand immunological responses and to apply these research findings to the development of effective vaccine, prevention, and therapeutic strategies for infectious and immune-mediated diseases, which includes immune-meditated rejection of transplanted organs and tissues. Translational studies using non-human primate models of pancreatic islet and solid organ transplantation are a key component of the Institute's efforts to achieve these goals.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives<br /><br />In 1999, NIAID with cosponsorship by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) established the Non-human Primate Transplantation Tolerance Cooperative Study Group (NHPCSG), a multi-center consortium whose goals are to develop novel immune tolerance induction regimens and evaluate the preclinical efficacy and identify the underlying mechanisms of the induction, maintenance or loss of tolerance in pancreatic islet, kidney, heart and lung transplantation models. <br /><br />In 2000 the NIAID began establishment of macaque breeding colonies to derive SPF macaques to support the research efforts of the NHPCSG. The objective of this competitive renewal is to continue support of the maintenance and care of the Government-owned macaque breeding colonies consisting of approximately 1400 Cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fasicularis) and Indian Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) and to provide up to approximately 300-research aged SPF animals a year to the NHPCSG investigators.</p>
<p>Project Requirements<br /><br />Potential sources must demonstrate and document the following in their capability statements:</p>
<p>&bull; Maintenance and care of the breeding colonies, assume a colony strength of up to approximately 800 Rhesus macaques (no known non-SPF) and 600 Cynomolgus macaques (less than 10% non-SPF);<br />&bull; Establishment of directed-breeding harems;<br />&bull; Establishment of fully SPF colonies;<br />&bull; Provision of up to 300 research-aged SPF animals a year. (For purposes of this contract research-age is at least two (2) years and three (3) years for Rhesus and Cynomolgus macaques, respectively.); <br />&bull; Provision of appropriate housing. Estimated housing requirements for Cynomolgus macaques: corrals, field cages or similar enclosures to house approximately 10 social groups of between 25 and 50 animals each and approximately 15 social groups of between 10 and 20 animals each. All caging/housing must have individual attached containment areas with temperature-controlled heating. Estimated housing requirements for the Indian Rhesus macaques: corrals, field cages, or similar enclosures to house approximately 25 groups of between 20 and 40 animals each and approximately 15 groups of less than 20 animals each;<br />&bull; Provision of genetic diversity assessment and planning; <br />&bull; Provision of MHC and/or MHC microsatellite typing in consultation with the Project Officer; <br />&bull; Provision of pedigree analysis; <br />&bull; Maintenance of a comprehensive animal and colony records database that shall be downloaded on a regular basis to the NIAID Bioinformatics Integration Support Contract (BISC) ImmPort database;<br />&bull; Maintenance of continuous full AAALAC accreditation and;<br />&bull; Provision for immediate culling of all confirmed newly converting, SPF-target virus positive animals from the colonies and any remaining non-SPF breeder animals in the colony when they are no longer required. Culling may include the purchase of the non-SPF animals from the Government at a below market rate.</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance<br /><br />The anticipated period of performance for this Government need, with all term options of the base period exercised, is September 30, 2010 - September 29, 2017. The anticipated contract type will be a cost reimbursement - term, level of effort, consisting of a base period of 12 months (1 year) with six one-year options to extend the contract. Additionally, multiple options will exist in each year to increase the required level of effort.</p>

Project Description and Scope 

As a part of the U.S. Public Health Service under the Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the Federal Governments primary biomedical research agency.  Its mission is science in pursuit of fundamental knowledge to extend healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and disability.  

The NIH is seeking to obtain the services of a Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) at Risk.  Independently, and not as an agent of the Government and upon acceptance of a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP), the Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, supervision, coordination, appliances, equipment, transportation, and any other element or item, as required for full and complete execution of the work in accordance with the specifications and drawings for the project.

The proposed project is the renovation of the F Wing of Building 10 on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland.  Due to partial occupancy of some areas within the F wing, the project consists of two interrelated tasks.  Task A consists of converting 64,000 gross square feet of former patient care units on F-Wing floors 2 through 5 to accommodate laboratories, lab support and administrative areas and to install new utilities infrastructure; the infrastructure work will support the renovation of the entire F-Wing and will include the installation of mechanical equipment on floors 4 and 14.

ARRA-funded Task B consists of the conversion of 151,600 gross square feet of former patient care units on F-Wing floors 6 through 13, to accommodate laboratories, lab support and administrative areas; work includes the installation of mechanical equipment on floors 9, 13, and 14.  Task B also includes fit-out of north corridor areas of floors 2 through 5 not constructed in Task A.

The Design Documents for Tasks A and B are the responsibility of the architectural and engineering consulting firms currently under contract.  

NIH intends to issue a separate RFP for a Construction Quality Manager (CQM) to provide services to assist the NIH Project Officer in the supervision of the performance of the A/E and the CMc in the projects for the Building 10 Renovation.


CMc Scope of Services  

The Government intends to negotiate a GMP utilizing approved 100% construction documents. These 100% documents will be issued with the solicitation to allow the Offeror to prepare their Guaranteed Maximum Price for the Pre-Construction and Construction Tasks.  

A single GMP will be required for both interrelated tasks (Task A, floors 2-5, and Task B, floors 6-13 and north corridor areas of floors 2-5).  Areas adjacent to the construction will be occupied throughout the renovation Tasks.

There may be a need to break out portions of the design and construction to allow for advanced procurement of long lead items. 

At the completion of Task A, the Government will conduct an Activation /Occupancy Task to equip and move occupants into floors 2 through 5 of the F-Wing.  Portions of Task B may be concurrent with Task A, but Task B can only be completed following the Activation/Occupancy of Task A.  A similar Activation / Occupancy Task will occur at the completion of Task B construction, equipping and moving occupants into floors 6 through 13.  The CMc shall coordinate its activities as required with the Governments Occupancy Tasks.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE. This sources sought is being conducted by the Memphis District, Corps of Engineers.  The purpose of this survey is to determine the availability, capability and interest of Small (8a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), and HUBZone Small Business concerns.<BR><BR><BR>PROJECT DESCRIPTION: This project will be for the removal of 10 diesel engine mufflers and 2 generator mufflers at Huxtable Pumping Plant and the replacement thereof with 2 stage catalytic converters.  The 10 pump engines are Fairbanks Morse 3600 horsepower engines driving storm water pumps.  The 2 515 Kw generators are powered by Caterpillar diesel engines.  The catalytic converters will be 2 stage, the first stage being a DOC (diesel oxidation converter) stage for the reduction of CO by 90%, and the second stage being an SCR ( selective catalytic reduction) for the reduction of NOx by 90%.  The SCR stage will use NX3 injection to reduce the NOx components.  The NX3 injection will be monitored and controlled by a sophisticated PLC control system using sensors mounted on the catalytic converter.  The controls will send signals to the NX3 flow valves which are responsible for accurately and constantly maintaining the proper ammonia flow rate so that the exhaust components never exceed allowable limits.  The system will use anhydrous ammonia for direct injection into the converters.  The transportation, storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia is very specialized and must be accomplished by someone familiar with all the rules and regulations dealing with the out-sourcing of flammable and hazardous chemicals.  A 12,000 gallon tank for the storage of pressurized anhydrous ammonia liquid will be a part of the overall system.   The manufacturer of the catalytic converters must show evidence that they have a minimum of 10 years experience in the construction and design of catalytic converters for large diesel engines.  The project will require that the contractor check and modify converter supports as necessary and be capable of field installation of all piping, controls, wiring, tanks and power necessary to make this system completely safe, functional and dependable. The applicable NAICS code for this contract is 237110 with a size standard of $33.5 million.  <BR><BR>Firms responding to this announcement are requested to demonstrate in writing their capability of performing this project by addressing the following items, numbered 1 through 5.<BR><BR>(1)	Provide the Firms name, address, and the size of the firm and its socio-economic status (Small, 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), or HUBZone Small Business).<BR><BR>(2)	Provide five examples of projects similar to the construction for the removal of 10 diesel engine mufflers and 2 generator mufflers at a pumping plant and the replacement thereof with 2 stage catalytic converters that has been performed within the past ten years.

All responsible sources may submit a response which, if received in a timely manner, will be considered.  This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals.

5.5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)

(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. 

(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

The period of performance for this service is one (1) base year plus four (4) one (1) year option periods. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a capability statement, which if received within ten (10) calendar days of the date of this announcement, may be considered. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. Responses to this notice must be in writing and provide clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. CLINs/SLINs X002 and X003 within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B to derive the total evaluated price. CLIN X004, "Taxes, Fees, and Surcharges," will not be included in the total evaluated price. CLIN X004 will be awarded at a "Not to Exceed" (NTE) amount of the documented annual TFS plus a _% escalation. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If during the term of the contract, the TFS's exceed the NTE amount, the contractor may submit a request for equitable adjustment (REA). The REA must document what TFS(s) changed to include supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued to establish a new NTE amount based upon the newly documented annual TFS plus a _% escalation.<br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

<p><br />Addendum</p>
<p>Wide Area Work Flow Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) Vendor Instructions <br />Installation and Registration Checklist</p>
<p>Completion of all instructions contained in this checklist must be accomplished prior to activation of the firm and user accounts.</p>
<p>1. Check Central Contractor Registration System (CCR) to see if your company is registered. <br />a. If you are registered in CCR, please go to Step 3 below. <br />b. For help with registration in CCR, contact CCR Helpdesk,<br />888-227-2423 or 269-961-4725, e-mail CCR@dlis.dla.mil, or see the CCR Handbook at http://www.ccr.gov/handbook.cfm.</p>
<p>2. Register with Central Contractor Registry (CCR). <br />a. All vendors desiring to bid on goods or services in support of Department of Defense (DoD) must be registered in the CCR at http://www.ccr.gov/. <br />b. Ensure that all mandatory fields are completed in your new CCR account (i.e., Telephone/FAX number, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) and/or Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) codes, North American Industry Code Systems (NAICS) codes, etc.). <br />c. Note: All contractors are required to update their CCR registration annually. Failure to do so will result in suspension of the account, which will prevent or delay awarding DoD contracts and payments to your firm.</p>
<p>3. Establish an Electronic Business Point of Contact (EB POC). <br />a. The next step is to ensure that you have identified an EB POC for your company. You are required to establish both a primary and alternate EB POC for each CAGE/DUNS code assigned to the firm. <br />b. To see if an EB POC is listed for your company, go to http://www.ccr.gov/http://www.ccr2000.com/ and click on "Search CCR." Where prompted, enter the DUNS or CAGE or Company Name and click "Submit Query." If you are presented with a list of DUNS numbers, you will need to pick the specific location and click on the DUNS. <br />c. Scroll to the bottom of the Inquiry Results page. There you can see if anyone is listed as the EB POC. If no one is listed, your company has not identified an EB POC yet. If you see that there is no one listed as your company's EB POC, you need click on "Update or Renew Registrations Using TPIN" to add it. <br />d. Each vendor organization may establish up to two EB POC's (primary and alternate) for each Cage/DUNS combination. <br />e. The EB POC will be responsible for authorizing access to employee(s) of the vendor's organization to view and/or modify data submitted on behalf of the vendor. <br />f. Update NAICS codes developed by the Census Bureau, which replaced the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. Until NAICS codes are updated, update will not be complete. For more info on NAICS codes, visit: http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html</p>
<p>4. Determine if your organization will designate a Group Administrator (GAM) (Proceed to paragraph 5 if you are not going to designate a GAM). <br />a. In medium to large sized companies, there may be a need to establish more than one GAM. <br />b. A GAM determines who has access to the WAWF-RA vendor account. <br />c. The initial GAM shall be the person designated as the EB POC. To appoint additional GAM's, each vendor must submit an official appointment letter signed by the EB POC. <br />d. The appointment letter should be faxed to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />e. The Group Administrator's Manual is available for reviewing to all WAWF-RA registered users. <br />f. The GAM Manual can be found in the Software Users Manual link within the WAWF-RA application.</p>
<p>5. Establish an organizational email address<br />a. All records created in WAWF-RA are stored in a virtual file folder and as status is updated or changes the system generates an email notification to applicable individuals identified in the firm's organizational email account. <br />b. The GAM or EB POC shall provide the organizational email to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />c. Ensure that your firm's organizational email address is operational and can receive email from WAWF-RA prior to registering your email address with the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />d. Note: If you do not set up an organizational email address, the personal email address of the first person who self-registers from your firm (CAGE/DUNS code), will be designated as the organizational email address for your firm.</p>
<p>6. Set up PCs to access WAWF-RA<br />a. Set up the PCs of your organization's users to access WAWF-RA. <br />b. Select the "Setting Up Your Machine" link on the WAWF-RA home page for more information: https://wawf.eb.mil/Instr.html.</p>
<p>7. Have all users self-register on the WAWF-RA web site<br />a. Every user for your firm must self-register on the WAWF-RA web site by completing the online registration form. <br />b. Select the "Self Register" link on the WAWF-RA home page and follow the instructions. <br />c. Users may access WAWF-RA with either a User ID/Password combination or a PKI certificate. Users who want to use a PKI certificate must obtain it before self-registering. <br />d. PKI Certificates may be obtained from one of the approved Interim External Certificate Authorities: Operational Research Consultants Inc. http://eca.orc.com, Digital Signature Trust Co. http://www.digsigtrust.com/home.html, or Verisign: http://www.verisign.com. The web sites provide the instructions needed to acquire a PKI Certificate. <br />e. If further assistance is needed, contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center.<br />f. Note: Registrations will not be activated until the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center receives an email from the EB POC/GAM as registered in the CCR data- base.</p>
<p>8. Follow-up (if necessary).<br />If your (GAM or user) account hasn't been activated within 2 business days of self-registering contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center:</p>

<DESC>This notice is a Combined Synopsis/Solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format of FAR Subpart 12.6, in conjunction with FAR Part 13.5 as applicable, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is being issued as a Request for Quotation. Submit offers on RFQ-AMOB-10002. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC2005-36 dated August 11, 2009. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a small set-aside business. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516, which has a size standard of 500. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to procure a laser benchtop flow cytometer required to facilitate the detection of subsets of cells of the human immune system. The laser options are to include a solid-state 488nm Blue laser (100mw) a solid-state 640nm Red laser (40mw) and a 405nm Violet laser (100mw) with the ability to detect 7-colors from the Blue laser, 3 colors from the Red laser and 5 colors from the Violet laser utilizing fiber optic technology. The laser control software shall allow the adjustment of power settings for the coherent lasers in the system (Blue, Red, Violet, Yellow-Green), and monitor key performance parameters of the coherent lasers. Computer workstation is to include one workstation with Intel Core Duo 2.67 GHz, 4MB, 1066MHz FSB (CPU), 128 PCI E Video Card, 2GB DDR2-667 ECC RAM, Dual Hard Drives (80GB and 250GB), 16X DVD +/-RW, 1.44MB Floppy Disk Drive, Network Cards (10/100/1000), Keyboard, USB Optical Mouse, Symantec Norton Ghost, Microsoft Office 2007, Windows XP, and Two (2) 19" NEC LCD Monitor. The flow cytometer must incorporate octagon and trigon-shaped collection optics that provide superior signal detection and future upgrades opportunities to do more than 18 colors simultaneously, must have a stainless steel sample injection rod that has only 30ul of dead volume that is very important if you are running acridine orange or PI dyes, must have a program that automatically QC's the system, verifies linearity, tracks/plots PMT voltage information and adjusts the timing windows for all lasers. This feature takes system QC to a higher level and simplifies operation because of the automate adjustment of the timing windows, must have a flow cell that is gel coupled to the fluorescence objective to allow 4X more light into the optical channel offering much higher resolution with lower powered lasers, must be able to offer a true UV laser at 350nm UV laser, must be able to be upgraded to run 7 lasers simultaneously. It is important that the instrument be able to use laser light sources from true UV 350nm to IR 780nm. This would allow the flow cytometer to be upgraded to match a wide range of new dyes that have been release and will soon be release. The wide range of light sources also allows you to move more experiments from a confocal microscope, must be backed by a 48-hour guaranteed service response time, since this instrument will be used to perform research flow cytometric experiments on patient samples in real time, it is vital that the machine not be out of service for extended periods of time, must be able to be upgrade to have automated sample uptake from 96 or 384 well trays. The software that operates the automated sample uptake system must be integrated into the overall machine operation software, must uses true digital technology from the preamp forward without dead time. The digital electronics signal processing eliminates processing dead time to minimize threshold aborts. The digital electronics must be able to scan the preamp pulse 10 million times per second to provide more linear quantitative measurements. The flow cytometer digital electronics minimizes system aborts, and must have the ability to threshold on multiple parameters simultaneously, must be able to be upgraded to have a FSC Diode and FSC PMT simultaneously. The FSC PMT will allow us to measure particles as small as .2u, and the diode can measure up to 50 micron particles simultaneously, and must have the ability to ratio any signal from any laser, the cytometer &lsquo;s flow cell must be of dimensions no less than 480 by 400 microns (one micron is one-thousandth of a millimeter). This will provide the ability to analyze relatively large cells in the flow cytometer, which can clog the small chamber that is termed the "flow cell," and must have automated compensation networks between all lasers and all fluorescence parameters. The Award will be based on: 1) the capability of the item offered to meet the above stated salient characteristics; 2) warranty; and 3) price. Warranty information to include period and coverage, shall be stated. Inside delivery shall be 30 days after receipt of order (ARO). Delivery will be made to Frederick, Maryland 21701. The FOB point shall be Destination. This will be a firm-fixed price contract.

Pages are House employees under the payroll and supervision of the Clerk.  Page eligibility is limited to juniors in high school who are at least sixteen years old on the date they begin their Page term and have met requisite academic and physical criteria.  This includes a 3.0 GPA, the physical ability to walk considerable distances in a day, the ability to carry and deliver packages of up to 25 pounds, and communication skills to answer the telephone and to speak fluently in English. The Program is divided into four employment sessions: two academic year session, which runs from August through January and January through June, and two one-month academic summer sessions, the last of which ends in early August.  Each session has an authorized strength of 72 positions.
  
The Page Program consists of three components: the school program, the work program, and residence program.  Policies and procedures governing the various aspects of the program, described below, are promulgated by the House of Representatives Page Board, which consists of two members from the Majority party, two Member from the Minority Party, the Clerk of the House and the Sergeant at Arms of the House. Day-to-day management of the program is the responsibility of the Office of the Clerk.

3.	Scope: 

The House of Representatives requires Contractor accommodation/lodging services.  The contract will require at least three locations to be proposed:

West  Richmond metropolitan area
North  Harrisburg, PA area
East  Ocean City, MD vicinity

The Contractor should provide a cost plus price quote for each location or specify that costs are equal.
	The anticipated contract period of performance shall extend from date of award for one year.  The House may extend the term of this contract up to three (3) times for a period of 12 months each.  Each of these options can be exercised at any time within the period of performance by the Office of the Clerk. 

4.	Description of Options:

The House of Representatives requires Contractor services in the following three geographical areas to coordinate the establishment of an emergency/coordination accommodation/lodging plan to provide for the safety, security, and well-being of the House Pages as the result of a malevolent or non-malevolent event or condition that may pose a risk to life or health.  A kick-off meeting will be held preceding the award of a contract.

West  Richmond metropolitan area
North  Harrisburg, PA area
East  Ocean City, MD vicinity

The Office of the Clerk may have to engage this contract with little to no notice to the Contractor.  An incident may present itself where the House must take immediate steps to move the Pages and then activate this contract while in route.  Thus the importance of the corporate contact that can engage the contract and direct us to the appropriate location.  While the original meeting point may not be the final destination, the ability to have a staging area in which to unload, utilize restrooms and eat may be a necessary step.  In other instances where we may have more notice, the House can work with the Contractor to plan a location and time of arrival.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.<br />(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:<br />(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or<br />(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).<br />(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.<br />(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<CONTACT>Deborah J Sparks, Contracting Officer, Phone 8015860690, Email deborah.sparks@hill.af.mil
<DESC><p>The A-10 Aircrew Training Systems (ATS) effort comprises two platforms: the A-10C precision engagement full mission trainer (FMT) and the hands on throttle and stick (HOTAS) Trainer. The A-10C FMT utilizes a high fidelity replica of the A-10 aircraft cockpit, an instructor operator station (IOS), a visual system, and simulation equipment to provide pilot initial and continuation training for flight mission and tactics. The HOTAS trainer is an A-10C precision-engagement (PE) functionality trainer meant for initial A-10C pilot conversion and training. Both simulators are augmented by a database generation system (DBGS). The A-10 ATS program provides contractor logistics support (CLS) and hardware/software modifications for trainers belonging to Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), and the Air National Guard (ANG) at 11 sites (9 domestic, 2 OCONUS). USAFE and PACAF are supported indirectly through ACC.
<p>This effort will acquire CLS services composed of operations and maintenance (O&amp;M), modifications, software, parts, the training system support center (TSSC), brief-debrief support, transition of the TSSC to Davis-Monthan AFB, and acquisition of additional simulator systems in support of A-10 Training Systems sustainment activities. The contractor will be responsible for all security aspects for this program and will maintain and ensure compliance with applicable statutes, laws, and regulations at all fielded locations.</p>
</p>
<p>The government solely owns all training assets including the physical trainers, instructor operator stations, brief-debrief systems, and all software/databases produced by the contractor for the A-10 ATS program. The Air Force purchases the services and equipment, necessary to support the trainers.</p>
<p>Primary activities supported under the A-10 ATS program include the four core requirements listed below:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull; Management: IMP/IMS, Engineering Design Reviews for majority of modifications, Configuration Management<br />&bull; Contractor Logistics Support (CLS): Maintenance, Spares<br />&bull; Training Systems Support Center: Modification Integration, Obsolescence, Computer Support<br />&bull; Modification</p>
<p>The Government anticipates issuing a single award contract which includes options.&nbsp; The duration of this contract is anticipated July 2010 through December 2014.<br /><br />The Government will issue a future&nbsp;announcement to this synopsis on how prospective bidders can obtain technical data associated with this requirement to prepare a proposal.&nbsp;<br /> <br />Once formal Request for Proposal is issued, all responsible sources may submit a response which, if received timely, must be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to cancel this notice at any time.</p>
<p>For preveious postings regarding this requirement, please refer to the sources sought synopsis FA8223-09-R-XXXX previously posted in FBO.&nbsp; For this and all future postings, please refer to solicitation number FA8223-09-R-3005.</p>

<DESC>This amendment corrects the response due day of the week.  Responses are due Thursday, October 22, 2009.

Task B of this project is being funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) and will stress energy efficient buildings and sustainable design and construction that optimize energy performance, employ integrated design principles and controls, protect and conserve water, enhance indoor environmental quality, and reduce environmental impact of materials. 
	
The contract vehicle for this service is a Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Deliver Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  This procurement will cover duration of a two (2) year base and three (3) one (1) year option periods for a total of five (5) years, and the total contract award value inclusive of all option years will not exceed $190M.  The Government intends to award one (1) IDIQ contract with a minimum guarantee of $2,500.00 inclusive of all five (5) years.  

This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUB Zone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 236220  Commercial and Institutional Building Construction for the proposed acquisition. The Small Business Size is $33.5 million.  

Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business concern under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.  NIH will not review any submittal received from an organization that is not a small business concern.


Project Description and Scope 

As a part of the U.S. Public Health Service under the Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the Federal Governments primary biomedical research agency.  Its mission is science in pursuit of fundamental knowledge to extend healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and disability.  

The NIH is seeking to obtain the services of a Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) at Risk.  Independently, and not as an agent of the Government and upon acceptance of a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP), the Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, supervision, coordination, appliances, equipment, transportation, and any other element or item, as required for full and complete execution of the work in accordance with the specifications and drawings for the project.

The proposed project is the renovation of the F Wing of Building 10 on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland.  Due to partial occupancy of some areas within the F wing, the project consists of two interrelated tasks.  Task A consists of converting 64,000 gross square feet of former patient care units on F-Wing floors 2 through 5 to accommodate laboratories, lab support and administrative areas and to install new utilities infrastructure; the infrastructure work will support the renovation of the entire F-Wing and will include the installation of mechanical equipment on floors 4 and 14.

ARRA-funded Task B consists of the conversion of 151,600 gross square feet of former patient care units on F-Wing floors 6 through 13, to accommodate laboratories, lab support and administrative areas; work includes the installation of mechanical equipment on floors 9, 13, and 14.  Task B also includes fit-out of north corridor areas of floors 2 through 5 not constructed in Task A.

The Design Documents for Tasks A and B are the responsibility of the architectural and engineering consulting firms currently under contract.  

NIH intends to issue a separate RFP for a Construction Quality Manager (CQM) to provide services to assist the NIH Project Officer in the supervision of the performance of the A/E and the CMc in the projects for the Building 10 Renovation.


CMc Scope of Services  

The Government intends to negotiate a GMP utilizing approved 100% construction documents. These 100% documents will be issued with the solicitation to allow the Offeror to prepare their Guaranteed Maximum Price for the Pre-Construction and Construction Tasks.  

A single GMP will be required for both interrelated tasks (Task A, floors 2-5, and Task B, floors 6-13 and north corridor areas of floors 2-5).  Areas adjacent to the construction will be occupied throughout the renovation Tasks.

There may be a need to break out portions of the design and construction to allow for advanced procurement of long lead items. 

At the completion of Task A, the Government will conduct an Activation /Occupancy Task to equip and move occupants into floors 2 through 5 of the F-Wing.  Portions of Task B may be concurrent with Task A, but Task B can only be completed following the Activation/Occupancy of Task A.  A similar Activation / Occupancy Task will occur at the completion of Task B construction, equipping and moving occupants into floors 6 through 13.  The CMc shall coordinate its activities as required with the Governments Occupancy Tasks.

Anticipated CMc Services 

The CMc at Risk shall

	Prepare and implement a Project Specific Safety Plan - The CMc is responsible for safety at the construction site.  
	Assist the Government in problem resolution 
	Provide  cost estimates
	Recommend to the Owner, A/E and CQM a schedule for procurement of long-lead items 
	Prepare and maintain a Quality Control Plan (QCP) including inspection  frequency and testing requirements.
	Prepare a Site Utilization Plan.
	Prepare a Project Specific Security Plan.

<DESC>To: 	All Requestors of the Prospectus for a Concession Business Opportunity for Marina, Merchandise, and Food and Beverage Operations within Amistad National Recreation Area.
Re:	Responses to Questions, CC-AMIS002-10
	Below please find the National Park Service's responses to questions submitted for the Prospectus for a Concession Business Opportunity for Marina, Merchandise, and Food and Beverage Operations within Amistad National Recreation Area.

1.  Is there a master development plan for the Amistad National Recreation Area?  
The General Management Plan was completed in 2007.  It provides general information for the future of the NRA for the next 20-25 years.  It may be found at http://parkplanning.nps.gov/. 2.  If so, does it address the maximum number of boat slips allowed on Lake Amistad?  
No, the General Management Plan does not address the maximum number of slips allowed on Lake Amistad as it is a general plan and does not address specific activities. 3.  Why is the Contract for only 10 years?  
Public Law 105-391 (Appendix 1 in the Prospectus) states that a concession contract will be for 10 years or less unless the Secretary determines a longer term is necessary. 4.  Why are there minimums and maximums on the rental houseboats and power boats? 
There is no minimum number of rental boats in the contract; however, the maximum number was determined based on lake levels, the size of the marinas, the current rental fleet and the financial impact of a larger fleet on the viability of the contract. 5.  What is exactly included in the Other Property/Inventory listed at $349,147?  
Appendix 5 (included in the Prospectus) provides an estimated list of all other property and inventory valued at $349,147.
6.  Can the Concessioner impose fees in the form of penalties for noncompliance of mooring agreements e.g. for violations of lengths of stays and for illegal sewage dumping? 
No, the Concessioner may not impose penalties in the form of fees for noncompliance.

If you have any questions, please contact Jacque Lavelle, Chief of Concessions at jacque_lavelle@nps.gov or at (303) 969-2661

Sincerely,



Michael D. SnyderRegional Director, Intermountain Region

********************************************************************************************

The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ intends to procure a Multi-Function Display (MFD) System in support of PMS 500?s DDG 1000 Program.  The tasks cover design, fabrication, testing and delivery of the production representative model, as well as support for integration, installation and checkout.  Upon successful completion of developmental test, integration test and first article test the Government may exercise contract options for production and fielding of seven systems and spares.  A competitive 100% Small Business Set Aside is anticipated.
The MFD program objective is the acquisition and initial support of an integrated display that will provide three different visual cues for day and night helicopter operations on DDG 1000 class ships.  The visual cues integrated into the MFD include the flight deck status display, a horizon reference display and an Aircraft-Ship Integrated Secure and Traverse (ASIST) System position display.  The MFD will communicate with the Total Ship Computing Environment Infrastructure (TSCEI) Network through redundant Distributed Adaptation Processors (DAPs) to receive ship?s roll stabilization signals from NAVDDX and to update settings such as deck status and lighting intensity to accommodate a variety of meteorological and lighting conditions for flight operations.  The system will be controlled by command signals from a remote operator.  The operator interface will be a Common Electronic Display (CED) provided by the ship builder and located in the Helicopter Control Station (HCS).  Commands will be received by the MFD via the TSCEI and DAPs.  Emergency operation and maintenance capability will be provided via a hard-wired maintenance control panel provided as part of the system.  The MFD program will involve designing, building and testing a production representative system in order to achieve the objectives set forth in the DDG 1000 Operational Requirements Document (ORD) and to demonstrate conformance to the MFD System Specification with the option to purchase production systems.  The MFD contract is a portion of the next generation suite of Visual Landing Aids which will be incorporated into the DDG 1000.
A Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued to the companies that respond to the FedBizOpps synopsis, as well as those companies on the solicitation mailing list.  Because the specifications and drawings are subject to Export Control Laws, the companies are required to register with the United States/Canada Joint Certification Office through the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), and provide a copy of their executed DD Form 2345 to the contracting office before a copy of the solicitation package is mailed.  It is mandatory to register with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database.  The CCR provides the DUNS (Data Universal Numbering System + 4 number) number and a company?s CAGE (Commercial and Government Entity) code that will be required to conduct business with the Department of Defense.
Award will be based on a determination of ?Best Value?, which may require discussions with the offerors. The evaluation factors will be Technical, Experience, Past Performance, and Price.  Copies of DD Form 2345 and request for copies of the solicitation shall be forwarded to Mr. David Andreoli, 732-323-5208, david.andreoli@navy.mil, fax # 732-323-7440.

<DESC>Questions and Answers on Pre-Solicitation Notice<BR><BR>Q1. Paragraph 3(a) stipulates that Final Clearance must be in place at the time of submission.  Is this an absolute requirement? It has been my experience that if you have been cleared in the past that you are given the opportunity to have your clearances confirmed after selection.<BR><BR>A1. The requirements and selection criteria regarding personnel and facility clearances are identified in paragraph 3(a) in the synopsis. Information regarding obtaining facility and personnel security clearances can be found at the Defense Security Services website: www.dss.mil<BR><BR>Q2. Is there a list of firms that are responding to this solicitation? <BR><BR>A2. A list of potential firms can be found on the Interested Vendors List tab on the Federal Business Opportunities website <BR>(www.fbo.gov) for this specific announcement. The selected firm will be listed on the Baltimore District website following contract award.  <BR><BR>Q3. I am attempting to get clarification on the Paragraph 3(a) where here it talks about Top Secret Clearances for all key personnel including the Cost Estimator.   Does the estimator have to have a TS clearance or they can not be on a team for this solicitation?  If they are a small business, can they still participate and obtain a clearance if their team is successful.  Will it hurt the large business that includes a SDBE Cost firm that does not yet have TS clearance for any its personnel?  <BR><BR>A3. See A1 for response regarding personnel clearances. <BR><BR>Q4. Regarding the top secret clearance requirement.  I always heard that you can only get this clearance if you are already under contract with an agency. So if you don't have a contract we can't get the clearance.  If we are a sub on several projects at Aberdeen post would this qualify us to put in for a top secret clearance?<BR><BR>A4. See Answer A1 regarding security clearances.

<DESC>RECOVERY ACTION. FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. DUNS 785627931.  The modification addresses the following work:  Nuclear Reaction Modeling for Actinides (joint Lawrence Livermore National Lab (LLNL)/Los Alamos National Lab (LANL) project).  The LLNL will develop a new technique to calculate the cross sections on actinides, in which the transition probability of fission is calculated based on a realistic multi-dimensional potential surface.  The microscopic model will also be applied to dynamical fission processes to calculate fission-fragment properties and prompt fission neutron spectra    Improved Prompt and Delayed Decay Spectra for Advanced Fuels.  The LLNL will characterize the time-dependent radiation emitted during the burning advanced fuels, including fuels from fast reactors, plutonium, and reusable spent fuels; and LLNL will benchmark these decay spectra through a combination of modeling, and new and existing measurements. The contractor will be working at Lawrence Livermore.

The action is other than fixed price because it is in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 5.705(b), the rationale for pricing this action Other than Fixed Price is due to the fact that LLNS operates under a cost re-imbursement Management and Operating (M&O) contract and all costs are fully recovered.   The other basis for Other than Fixed Price is because this is a Research and Development type work authorization and is therefore cost-reimbursable. 

NOTE:  This action is awarded under Modification no. M096 that recognizes Work Authorization no. KB/NS50/9/ARRA-2 issued under M&O Contract number DE-AC52-07NA27344.  This action is funded by Recovery Act dollars.

Length of service<BR>includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<BR>successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<BR>performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)<BR><BR>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<BR>King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<BR>Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A<BR>contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<BR>accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174)<BR><BR><BR><BR>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:<BR><BR>1)  COMPUTER EMPLOYEES:  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<BR>not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<BR>administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because<BR>most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<BR>not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<BR>week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<BR>400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<BR>within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not<BR>list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<BR>data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<BR>$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For<BR>example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<BR>within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<BR>occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<BR>then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<BR>conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<BR>determination.<BR><BR>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<BR>industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<BR>professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<BR>who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<BR>    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<BR>consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<BR>specifications;<BR>    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<BR>modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<BR>related to user or system design specifications;<BR>    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<BR>programs related to machine operating systems; or<BR>    (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<BR>requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).<BR><BR>2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you<BR>work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<BR>and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<BR> If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<BR>regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<BR>premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<BR>(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<BR>overtime work).<BR><BR><BR>HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<BR>employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<BR>in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This<BR>includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<BR>ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<BR>and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<BR>Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<BR>on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations<BR>involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.<BR><BR>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<BR>represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<BR>ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<BR>which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<BR>employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<BR>like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<BR>All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<BR>incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials<BR>are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<BR>ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.<BR><BR>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **<BR><BR>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<BR>(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<BR>local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<BR>laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<BR>employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<BR>determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<BR>following standards as compliance:<BR><BR>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<BR>adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<BR>cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<BR>the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<BR>this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<BR>agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<BR>affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<BR>and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in<BR>those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of  wash and wear<BR>materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<BR>not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<BR>laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<BR>of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<BR>there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.<BR><BR>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<BR>Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations, Fifth Edition, April 2006,<BR>unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<BR>links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<BR>gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<BR>http://wdol.gov/.<BR><BR>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<BR>1444 (SF 1444)}<BR><BR>Conformance Process:<BR><BR>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<BR>not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<BR>be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<BR>determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<BR>relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<BR>classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such<BR>conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<BR>fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by<BR>the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<BR>of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<BR>be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<BR>When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<BR>should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<BR>conformed.<BR><BR>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:<BR><BR>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<BR>occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).<BR><BR>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<BR>proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<BR>proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<BR>rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<BR>authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<BR>representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the<BR>contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<BR>performs any contract work.<BR><BR>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<BR>of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<BR>information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<BR>and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<BR>for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).<BR><BR>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<BR>disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<BR>notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<BR>the request.<BR><BR>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.<BR><BR>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.<BR><BR>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.<BR><BR>When preparing a conformance request, the Service Contract Act Directory of<BR>Occupations (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<BR>that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<BR>wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<BR>determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<BR>Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<BR>classifications listed in the wage determination.<BR>
