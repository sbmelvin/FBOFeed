Critical to the success of this program is maintaining a focus on enabling, rather than directing, the growth of the private sector.
 
The primary goal of this program is to increase the contribution of the private sector to economic growth in a minimum of four provinces including: Badakhshan, Nangarhar, Helmand and Heart, with the following objectives:  

1. Expand markets, increase access to information, and lower transaction costs.
2. Develop the workforce through technical, trade, accounting, and managerial training.
3. Create jobs through growth of small and medium-sized enterprises.
4. Promote domestic and foreign investment.
5. Compete internationally where Afghanistan has, or potentially has, a comparative advantage.
6. Develop Afghan domestic markets and improve productivity to help local products become competitive with imports.

This is a full and open competition and the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply. The authorized geographic code for procurement of goods and services under this solicitation is 935. As such, this procurement is open to all offers from USAID Geographic Code (Source, Origin and Nationality) 935 which include all countries, except for those designated by the US Government as foreign policy restricted countries. The current foreign policy restricted countries are as follows: Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria.

USAID encourages the participation to the maximum extent possible of small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns and women-owned small business concerns in this activity as the prime contractor or as subcontractor in accordance with Part 19 of the FAR. USAID also encourages the use of the Interested Vendor List (IVL) on the Federal Business Opportunities website page so that firms can contact one another for consideration of teaming arrangements and/or small business subcontracting opportunities in response to this solicitation.

USAID anticipates awarding a single award Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract.  The period of performance will be 3 years with two one year options. The RFP is expected to be issued on March 14, 2006 and proposals will be due no later than the closing date specified in the RFP.  Any amendments to this solicitation will be issued on the website along with the RFP. Please check the Federal Business Opportunities website (http://www.fbo.gov) periodically.

Any questions should be submitted via email to the point of contact at: apsobangkok@usaid.gov.

Please do not contact USAID/Afghanistan in Kabul directly, since all communication must be through this office.  The release of this notice in no way obligates USAID or the US Government to release an RFP or make an award of any type.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for proposals (RFP) for the following item: Radio Frequency Induction Coil. NOTE: First, read specs below and if interested contact the buyer for performance dwgs. The drawings would not upload to this site.  Description: Detailed design and precision manufacture of high efficiency long life specialty water cooled RF inductive coil assemblies. These units shall be suitable for operation in a pure nitrogen environment with external pressures up to 1100 psi and heated part temperatures to 3100 K. Material: Copper and other materials suitable for vacuum and high pressure nitrogen atmosphere operation. Items: 1) 4 x RF assemblies composed of inductor coils capable of producing specified linearly increasing power distributions.  2) Magnetic or other RF shielding component to minimize coupling to surrounding supports. 3) Internal Busswork to connect coil assemblies to the test chamber feed through. Delivery: 12 to 16 weeks after receipt of order (ARO)  Source: Selection shall be based on lowest cost technically acceptable offer.  RF Induction Coil and Network Specification:  It is required that four RF inductive coil assemblies be designed and fabricated for multiple cycle operation while being exposed to high heated part temperatures (up to 3100 K) The coil assemblies shall have end to end power gradients of 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8 and shall have a working length of 10 inches. The heated part is tubular with a circular cross-section typically  0.5 inch outside diameter. Typical part materials include graphite, cermets, and heavy metal carbides with electrical resistivity curves given in Figures 1 and 2 (Must be requested). The vendor shall have sufficient RF inductive heating system design experience and 2-Dimensional electromagnetic modeling capabilities to thoroughly detail the performance of these assemblies for both nominal and off nominal operations. Prior to initiating fabrication, the performance estimates and 2-D modeling (with assumptions) shall be provided to the MSFC end user for review and approval. Once approved, the Vendor may proceed with manufacturing and test evaluation of the RF coil assemblies. Vendor shall state (describe) relevant experience, capability and manufacturing specifications/guidelines in their response. End item performance requirements:  1. Efficiency – the RF inductive coil assemblies and buss work shall be designed to be as efficient as possible in (a)Coupling to the heated part, and (b)Making use of available power to satisfy the required applied power levels. The frequency range for the RF power supply for this application is 30 to 100 kHz.  2. Thermal Environment – the RF inductive coils shall be capable of withstanding at least 300 operational cycles (with each cycle lasting one to two hours) while heating the test part to temperatures of approximately 3100 K. The final design (to be performed during execution of the purchase order) shall dictate the final gap width between the heated test part surface and the inner diameter of the inductive coil. The design shall place the coil as far from the heated surface as possible to minimize thermal losses through the insulation yet sufficiently close to achieve acceptable inductive coupling. The design shall also include sight holes through the coil to the surface of the test part to allow temperature measurements to be made using optical pyrometers. Overall, there shall be five sight holes spaced 2 1/16” apart with the center sight hole offset 45º from the others as illustrated in Figure 3 (To be provided). The details of these sight holes shall be discussed with MSFC as part of the final design.  3. Materials and Environment: The RF inductive coil assemblies shall be used in a test chamber capable of both vacuum or high pressure (up to 1100 PSI) purified nitrogen/hydrogen atmosphere. Contamination is a concern, therefore, only materials suitable for vacuum and exposure to high temperature nitrogen/hydrogen are suitable for use. The coil assemblies must be manufactured in such a way as to minimize the potential for trapped material  impurities or gas pockets which could continually outgas during test operations.  4. Cooling – the RF inductive coil system and buss work shall make use of cooling water supplied at the RF power supply (water supply is not part of this procurement)  5. Internal Busswork – all busswork between the inductive coils and test chamber feed through shall be designed and fabricated. The coil position within the test chamber shall be discussed with MSFC but is not expected to be more then 2 feet from the feed-through. The design shall include any structural support points/hardware to position the RF coil within the test chamber (with electrical isolation).  6. Power Distribution – each RF coil shall provide a given linear power gradient across its length with respective values of 1:1 (uniform), 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8. The power variation shall be within +/-5% of the linear profile with minimal power tilting at either end. The power deposition shall also be symmetric about the full circumference. Additionally, the linear gradients  requirements on each coil shall be maintained regardless of the actual total power level the RF coil is operated; covering a total power range of at least 1kW to 125 kW in the part.  7. Mutual inductance and Interference – there shall be provisions to minimize the RF coils from coupling to the support structure. This is necessary to maintain the power level and distribution into the part and alleviate heating of the structural elements. The vendor should use a cost effective method which shall be suitable to all four coil types. The materials shall be compatible with vacuum and high pressure nitrogen/hydrogen operation.  8. Leak Checking – No leaks can be tolerated within the test chamber, therefore, all connections must be welded or brazed. No low temperature silver solder joints or brazes are allowed since a thermal soak back condition during power out) could re-melt these joints and introduce high pressure gas into the water system (or fill the test chamber with water if at low operating  pressure). These assemblies shall be checked with a helium mass spectrometer leak detector with a sensitivity capable of detecting leaks rates of 1x 10-10 std-cc/sec of helium or lower.  Final acceptance and packaging – documentation shall be generated regarding the design performance with results of 2-dimensional analysis, hardware layout, hook-up and operation and provided to MSFC for final review/acceptance. The complete RF inductive coil assemblies, test chamber feed-throughs and busswork / sensors shall be packaged in a manner to prevent damage or contamination and shipped to MSFC. The anticipated release date of RFQ 4200138286 is on 2/28/2006 with an anticipated proposal due date of 3/22/2006. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. An ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

Solicitation CCR-CCR-06-0001 is not a small business set aside and will be awarded as a firm fixed-price contract.     

Scope of Work

A.  The Contractor shall be required to conduct a full scope financial audit of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights’ (the Commission) annual financial statement for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2006.  

The audit shall be performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS), as specified in the most current version of the GAO’s Government Auditing Standards (GAS), and additional audit requirements of the OMB.  In conducting the audit, the methodology used shall be at a minimum, consistent with the most current version of the GAO/President’s Council on Integrity and Efficiency (GAO/PCIE) Financial Audit Manual (FAM).  Should there be any deviations from the methodology set forth in the FAM, the Contractor must provide documentation to the COTR on a timely basis, demonstrating how the Contractor’s methodology satisfies the requirements of the FAM.  The COTR shall be notified immediately of any significant deviations from the FAM.

B.  With respect to internal control, the Contractor shall obtain an understanding of the components of internal control and assess the level of control risk relevant to the assertions embodied in the classes of transactions, account balances, and disclosure components of the financial statements.  The Contractor shall also obtain an understanding of the components of internal control relating to the existence and completeness assertions relevant to the performance measures included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A).

With respect to MD&A, the Contractor shall assess whether the information and manner of its presentation in the MD&A of the Reporting Entity is materially consistent with the information in the principal statements. In performing this assessment, the Contractor shall consider this required supplementary information and shall follow the guidelines presented in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ (AICPA) AU Section 551, Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards, and shall perform the procedures described in the AICPA’s AU Section 558, Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards. In addition, the Contractor shall obtain an understanding of the design of internal controls relating to the existence and completeness assertions over performance measures and determine whether they have been placed in operation, as required by OMB Bulletin 01-02, as amended, or the most current OMB audit guidance.

With respect to Required Supplementary Stewardship Information (RSSI) and Required Supplementary Information (RSI), the Contractor shall assess whether the information and its presentation is materially consistent with the information in the principal statements.  In performing this assessment the Contractor shall follow the guidelines presented in the AICPA’s AU Section 551, Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards, and shall perform procedures consistent with AICPA’s AU Section 558, Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards.
 
With respect to Other Accompanying Information, the Contractor shall assess whether the information and its presentation is materially consistent with the information in the principal statements.  In performing this assessment, the Contractor shall follow the guidelines presented in AICPA’s AU Section 551, Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards, and shall perform procedures consistent with AICPA’s AU Section 550, Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards.

C.  As part of the USCCR FY04 Financial Statement Audit, the Contractor shall perform procedures to assess the effectiveness of the information system control environment.  The procedures will focus on evaluating the adequacy of information systems controls over the following GAO’s Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual (FISCAM) general control areas:

•	Entity-wide Security Program Planning and Management,
•	Access Controls (including mainframe system logical security and data center physical security),
•	Segregation of Duties (for data center management and operations),
•	Application Software Development and Change Control,
•	System Software Controls and Modification, and
•	Service Continuity.

This work will also be utilized by other USCCR personnel with respect to the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requirements.  Thus, the information system control environment review performed shall be coordinated with the COTR to ensure the work is completed timely enough for other USCCR personnel to use in performing their audits.

D.  The Contractor shall review the consolidated interim, draft, and final financial statement packages for compliance with USCCR requirements.  The Contractor shall document each review in the workpapers and notify the COTR of the results within seven (7) working days of the review.  Notification shall be in writing, through e-mail, or by fax.

E. Audit Documentation

All audit documentation shall be prepared in accordance with GAS and contain the required elements prescribed by GAS.  The contractor shall also consult the GAO/PCIE FAM for specific audit documentation contents.  At a minimum, audit documentation should include a summary memorandum documenting the conclusions reached on each significant internal control cycle, account balance, lead schedule, phase of the audit, audit adjustments, and on the overall audit.  Adequate indexing and cross referencing must exist.  The contractor shall also ensure that audit documentation contains the audit completion checklist FAM 1003. 

The Commission shall have ongoing access to auditors and audit documentation at all times.  USCCR will accept electronic work papers and adequately cross-referenced hard-copy files to meet this requirement.  These documents shall become the property of USCCR and shall not be disclosed outside of USCCR, unless required by statute or regulation, without the prior consent.

Audit documentation may also be subject to review by other Government auditors such as the GAO, therefore, the contractor shall make audit documentation available to the GAO or any other federal entity conducting a review or audit of USCCR. Based on the results of these reviews, the contractor may be required by the COTR to perform corrective action and/or additional work within the scope of the contract necessary to support its audit conclusions, if necessary.

Audit documentation shall be retained and safeguarded for a minimum of 2 years by the Contractor at no additional cost. Written approval must be obtained from the Commission's Office of General Counsel prior to destruction of any audit documentation. 

It is imperative that the Contractors protect all audit documentation from unauthorized access.  Only Contractor staff with a need to know shall have access to audit documentation.

<DESC>This is a competitive combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  Solicitation No. DTRT57-06-Q-80055 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), FAR Part 12 and 13.5.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-07.  The NAICS Code is 443120 and the Small Business size standard is $8.0 Million.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; competitive proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Government intends to award  a Firm Fixed-Price Purchase Order on a competitive basis.  The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) has a requirement to purchase dispatch and scheduling software and training on how to use the software for the Cape Cod Regional Transit Authority (CCRTA) Flex Bus Service, in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW).  The SOW for Flex Scheduling and Dispatch Software is as follows: The Contractor will provide a software system to support scheduling and dispatch functions for a deviated fixed route service proposed on Cape Cod (Flex service).  This service is expected to begin operation on June 5, 2006.  The contractor must provide all required training and implementation items before the start of service and provide a schedule to comply with this requirement. This  type of transit service is new to the Cape Cod Regional Transit Authority (CCRTA) and, although the organization is familiar with fixed route and demand response services, the current software and dispatch system does not have the ability to accommodate Flex.  The desired software and dispatch system must be capable of real time scheduling decisions and modifications in which alternative trip itineraries are developed and compared to a deviation “budget” available for one or more trip options. The software must provide the ability to present these options to clients and make reservations expediently.  The software will recognize two distinct types of trip requests, subscription and unexpected.  The software must also be capable of interfacing with schedules for other transportation servic es and locations that may or may not be at defined Flex fixed route stops.  The software must have a proven track record with other agencies operating similar deviated fixed route systems.  Requirements - The major requirements of the software called for by this RFQ include the following abilities: Client registration and trip booking; Interface to the fixed route schedule and other CCRTA and private schedules; The ability to locate an address on a map; The ability to determine the closest defined fixed route bus stop to an address; The ability to route vehicles from a bus stop to an address and return to the next bus stop on the fixed route. This will include a distance and a net time estimate (deviation time – fixed route time); A two-way Mobile Data Terminal (MDT) interface and Automati c Vehicle Locator (AVL) tracking capability with the CCRTA Flex buses; Real time dispatching; The ability to archive dispatching, AVL tracking, weather conditions, and request outcomes to a database for reporting and analysis.  Compatibility - The dispatch system must be compatible with the CCRTA MDTs, AVLs and the communications systems to support the FLEX service.  The MDTs and AVLs on the Flex buses are produced by Mentor Engineering.  The contractor will be required to show that its software package can function with MDTs and AVLs produced by Mentor Engineering and used on the Flex buses.  Training - The contractor must provide all training before the beginning of service on June 5, 2006.  Training must include contractor staff on-site to train Cape Cod RTA employees who will be using  the software during operations.  The contractor should train the CCRTA staff with a “train-the-trainer” method that allows those staff to train other CCRTA staff in the future. Maintenance - The contractor must provide a maintenance package for no fewer than 3 years after initial installation.  Maintenance would cover any repairs and replacements needed because of system malfunctions.  The contract line items (CLINS) are as follows:  CLIN 0001:  Software system, 1 EA $____________; CLIN 0002: Maintenance, 1 EA $____________; CLIN 0003: Training and Installation, 1 EA $___________; Total Firm Fixed Price Amount for CLINs 0001, 0002 and 0003: $___________.   All proposals should be marked with the solicitation number.  The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitati on to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will represent the best value to the Government, considering price and that all requirements listed in the SOW are provided.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) desires the acquisition of a multi-purpose warhead for use on the 2.75 inch hydra rockets fired from Special Operation Forces (SOF)aviation platforms. USSOCOM intends to qualify a multi-purpose warhead that is effective against an array of targets to include buildings, bunkers and ships. (1) Penetration: When mounted on a MK66 rocket motor and fired, the warhead will function after penetrating 24 inches of reinforced concrete and  four feet of timber/earthen bunkers at typical engagement ranges. (2) Non-Developmental / In Service Status: The multi-purpose warhead must be non-developmental and qualified by other allied North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries.  (3) Mass/Center of Gravity (CG) Flight Characteristics:  When mounted on a Hydra rocket motor, the warhead will have a similar mass and center of gravity when compared to the M229/M151 warhead to insure minimum need to change supporting fire control instrumentation (weapon racks) or effect ongoing spiral developments (precision kill weapon system).  (4) Incendiary Effect: The multi-purpose warhead must provide an incendiary effect to create secondary fires after impact. (5) Training Warhead: It is desired that the vendor provide an inert day/night warhead (to replace the M274) warhead that provides a visible hit signature. The new warhead should minimize unexploded ordnance (UXO) hazards. When deployed overseas, the new warhead should allow SOF forces to conduct training on allied ranges without creating UXO hazards or creating in-advertent range fires. (6) Facilities, Expertise and Safety: These warheads should meet stringent Navy Weapon System Explosive Safety Review Board (WSESRB) requirements /standards. The warheads should provide for reduced reaction from outside stimuli (Insensitive Munitions (IM)characteristics and provide for good performance after undergoing storage in various environments. ** Responses to this market survey are due on or before 13 Mar 2006 and must include a product description with performance parameters and a statement regarding current availability, summary of prior testing, test reports, summary of logistic and maintenance requirements and an estimated cost for the price of test articles and production units. This synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to issue an order or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Interested Parties should reply by submitting a White Paper no later than 13 Mar 2006. Questions may be submitted in writing to Mr. William Andrews at the above address or via email to william.andrews@socom.mil. Interested Parties who are willing to provide qualified warheads at no cost for USSOCOM testing should so indicate in the submitted white paper. No further information is available from the contracting office.

<SUBJECT>H -- NATO Notification of Intent to Invite Bids for International Competitive Bidding for Geospatial Independent Verification and Validation Team for Bi-SC AIS Core Geographic Services Implementation
<SOLNBR>IFB-CO-11934-GIS
<RESPDATE>040406

<CONTACT>Lee Ann Carpenter, Trade and Industry Analyst, Phone 202-482-2583, Fax 202-482-5650, Email Lcarpent@bis.doc.gov - David Newsom, Trade & Industry Analyst - NATO Company Certification, Phone 202-482-7417, Fax 202-482-5650, Email dnewsom@bis.doc.gov
<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid on the procurement of a Geospatial Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) team for the duration of the implementation of the Bi-SC AIS Core Geographic Services Capability. Bi-SC AIS Core Geographic Services Capability is part of the overall project to provide a Final Geographic Information System throughout the NATO Command Structure, and in support of KFOR and ISAF.

NC3A is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. Contractor selection will be based on the lowest compliant bid through the use of the One Step Procedure.  

The reference of the Invitation for International Bid (IFB) is IFB-CO-11934-GIS. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same IFB reference.

The resulting Geospatial IV&V Team Contract shall be ineligible for award of IFB-CO-11424-GIS (Bi-SC AIS Core Geographic Services Capability). Further, the Geospatial IV&V Team Contractor shall be fully independent of the Contractor accomplishing the above cited Contract and his respective Sub-Contractors. As such, the IFB and the resulting Contract(s) will contain an Exclusion from Present and Future Work provision, which will exclude the successful Contractor from participation in any other Contract related to the implementation of Bi-SC AIS Core Geographic Services Capability. This exclusion clause shall also apply to any parent subsidiaries (including international divisions) of the Contractor.

The IFB package will not contain material of a classified nature. Prospective bidders should be aware, however, that Contractor personnel will be called upon to work at a NATO site in connection with the Contract and such Contractor personnel will be required to have security clearances to the level of NATO SECRET. All such personnel clearances must be in place prior to the contract award.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

The Bi-SC AIS Core Capability Services project is aimed at providing an Enterprise-level Distributed and Guaranteed Geospatial Services Provision sustained by the Organization Geographers Community to ensure that all phases of military operations are conducted on the same spatial and time frame of reference to enable fighting off the same map at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels.

The central goal is to move away from GIS product-driven solutions and toward Geospatial business services. By focusing on the Geospatial Services, applications are aggregated to provide richer, more meaningful business processes reflecting a truer alignment with the Geospatial-related business model.  

The Architectural Objective of the Bi-SC AIS Core Geographic Services primarily targets the adoption and implementation of a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) Concept and will be founded on an open n-tier and distributed architectural model providing modular, flexible, and autonomic architectural elements to support scalability as Commands grow, to support change management as missions change and evolve, and to leverage the evolution of technology. The Capability forms a mission-critical element of the overall Bi-SC AIS.

In addition, open standards (ISO/TC211, IETF, W3C, OASIS, DGIWG, and OGC) are essential to the architecture success, not only from a modularity perspective, but in particular from an interoperability aspect. This is crucial in order to facilitate geospatial information exchange between the Core and Functional Services, not only within the Bi-SC AIS framework, but also with the nations. Open standards form the basis for a NATO Geospatial Interoperability Framework.

The main activities to be undertaken by the Bi-SC AIS Core Geographic Services Capability Contractor are the design, testing, supply and installation (18+ sites), and training of the Staff.

In order to assess the overall implementation process of a complex and mission-critical system, a Geospatial Independent Verification & Validation Contractor shall provide a Team, composed of a Senior Geospatial Business Analyst and Senior Geospatial Technology Architect/Engineer, that will be selected through this ICB to support the NC3A in evaluating the work being performed under the Bi-SC AIS Core Geographic Services Capability Implementation effort.

The Geospatial IV&V Team will have to perform theirs tasks at different locations (NC3A-BE, NC3A-NL, NATO Sites/Commands, and Implementation Contractor facilities) to support the various phases of the project. Their main role will be to:

- Conduct, maintain and monitor independent risk assessment,
- Verify process conformance reviews and configuration audits,
- Verify compliance of Contractor implementation deliveries,
- Validate/Assist the Host Nation in Critical Reviews, 
- Inspect code, and verify and validate Implementation Contractor tests,
- Independently validate the acceptance test results, and
- Verify, validate, and contribute to the evolution of an Enterprise-based Geospatial Process Model.

The Geospatial IV&V Team shall be operational/available on a permanent basis from Contract Award through Final System Acceptance of the Core GIS Project. As the duration is estimated at 30 calendar months, this will require 1200 man-days of effort (30 calendar months x 20 man-days/month x 2 profiles).

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Embassy, which in turn forwards it to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) has been issued. 
 
IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Department of Commerce to submit a Declaration of Eligibility on your behalf: 4 April 2006

2. Anticipated date that the Host Nation will forward the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) to those on the Bidders List: April 2006

3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: end of May 2006

4. Anticipated contract award date: July 2006

<CONTACT>Kathryn Gonzales 850-235-5354 , or Contracting Officer Mary Hines at 850-235-5389.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to award a sole source firm fixed price contract to the L-3 Titan Group of San Diego, CA. for the production of selected components for the Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) Reliability Improvement Program (RIP) C4N System.  NSWC PC is the Systems Integration Agent (SIA), In-Service Engineering Agent (ISEA), Technical Support Activity (TSA) and Software Support Activity in support of the LCAC Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Navigation (C4N) program.  This requirement is for acquisition of the following components required to improve the reliability of the LCAC C4N systems. The initial acquisition will be for seven (7) sets of the components with options for an additional thirteen sets for LCACs scheduled for the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP). The components are:  (1) Integrated UKB Computer systems (one per set), (2) Integrated Navigation Comput!  er systems (one per set), (3) Integrated IP based Common Data Recorder (CDR) Computer systems (one per set), (4) Spare CDR Removable Drive with Carrying Case (one per set), (5) Ethernet Network Switch Assembly (one per set), (6) Control & Alarm Monitoring System (CAMS) Video Switch RIP unit (one per set), (7) 4x4 Keypad (two per set), (8) Operator Display Panel (ODP) (one per set), (9) Craft Control Card (two per set), and (10) Additional Spare CDR Removable Drives with Carrying Case (30 total).  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons:  (1) These components were uniquely designed by L-3 Titan Group for the LCAC C4N RIP and are not commercially available. L-3 Titan Group also built the first prototypes for testing. The prototype RIP hardware has undergone environmental qualification testing (EQT) and the design was refined by L-3 Titan based on the results of these tests,  (2) The LCAC Navigation (NAV) System RIP processing uni!  t, Universal Keyboard System RIP processing unit, the Control & Alarm  Monitoring System (CAMS) Video Switch RIP equipment, LCAC Common Data Recorder RIP and the LCAC Ethernet Switch Assembly being procured are required to be compatible with existing LCAC equipment.  The RIP equipment specified above is 100% compatible with the existing LCAC Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) equipment with the transition from FDDI to Ethernet.  Software (embedded operating systems, operational flight software and offline diagnostics) has been developed and tested with the new RIP hardware configuration.  Maintenance and operator training have also been developed for the LCAC C4N RIP configuration as well.  Technical manual updates are being performed to match the new RIP hardware configuration.    Therefore it is in the Government’s best interest to purchase the equipment from L-3 Titan that will allow for re-use of the developed software, training and qualified hardware as well as being compatible with other existing C4N equipment, (3) While drawings were !  developed for the equipment they are insufficiently detailed at this point to support competitive acquisition of the components, (4) This is a direct follow-on to efforts conducted under contracts N61331-98-D-0002 and N61331-04-C-0015 for highly unique components of a complex system within the meaning of FAR 6.301(a)(ii), and (5) Given L-3 Titan Groups intimate and detailed knowledge of the design of these components it is unlikely that any other vendor could overcome the learning curve required to be cost effective. Delivery will be to the Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, Panama City, FL 32407-7001. NAICS Code 334511 applies. SBA Size Standard is 750 employees.   FSC is 6605.  A request for proposal will be utilized in awarding this action on or about  17 April 2006.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A  PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.   The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Consolidated Operations Acquisition Center (COAC) for the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) intends to negotiate and award  a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to  Dr. H. George Hausch, 7805 Oracle Place, Potomac, Maryland 20854,  to provide consultation services to the Scientific Review Branch (SRB), Division of Extramural Division, NIDCR. Background: The Scientific Review Branch (SRB) provides assistance and expertise in specific scientific areas, including women and minorities, for review of the grant applications. Assistance is provided in the following logistical tasks by identifying potential reviewers from various sources such as knowledgeable staff, the literature, and databases; confirming personal data and provide this information to Scientific Review Branch (SRB) Scientific Review Administrators (SRA) to make selections for the review; setting up and monitoring electronic review; and editing documents.  Statement of Work: Specifically, the Contractor shall provide consultation services to the NIDCR, providing services required of a Scientific Review Branch expert familiar with the structure of NIDCR programs and staffing to assist  with the grant applications and identify areas of expertise needed for scientific merit review.  Identify potential reviewers by consultation with Review and Program staff, checking the literature and various data bases such as the IMPAC II, Medline, and Grateful Med, and active grant lists; obtain curriculum vitae; confirm personal data such as addresses, FAX number, expertise, etc.  The Contractor will place special emphasis in identifying minority and women candidates.  The Contractor will assist with all necessary follow-up via telephone and email, to confirm meeting dates, set up and monitor electronic review and edit documents.  The Contractor will also provide substantial assistance to update the reviewer profiles in the IMPAC II database.  The Contractor shall not manage the initial review of grant or cooperative agreement applications or contract proposals’, determine conflicts of interest, invite consultants to serve on peer review panels, or assign consultants specific responsibilities in the assessment of scientific and/or technical merits of the applications/proposals. The Contractor shall not serve as the Designated Federal Official who manages a review panel meeting. The Contractor shall not provide official guidance concerning peer review laws, regulations, NIH policies and procedures to peer review consultants, federal staff, or applicants. The Contractor shall not prepare the final written report (the “Resume and Summary of Discussion” for applications or Technical Evaluation Report for contract proposals). Reporting Requirements:   The Contractor shall report on a weekly basis the number of hours worked.  Period of Performance: This project is expected to require 720 man hours during the period of performance, beginning the date of the award and approximately seven (7) months.  The sole source determination is based upon the knowledge, skills and expertise associated with Dr. Haunch’s 34 years of experience working in and with the NIH peer review system as a program administrator with National Institutes of Health National Institute of Dental & Craniofacial Research (NIDCR).  This source is intimately familiar with the wide variety of occupations at NIDCR and is sensitive to the needs of the oral health research community, because of his familiarity with the Program Announcements (PA) and Request for Applications (RFA) requiring review assistance and support: Request for Applications: (RFA): DE-06-003, DE-06-005, DE-06-008, DE-006-008, Program Announcement Requests (PAR):-03020, 03-059, 03-042. He is familiar with both the program and review staff associated with these Funding Opportunity Announcements’ (FOA) and based on past activities is able to work closely with the staff.    An award to any other source would affect the NIH anticipated outcome based upon Dr. Hausch, experience, and knowledge, and would not provide any cost savings to the Government. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541990 and the Size Standard $6M.  The acquisition is being conducted  under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures. It is noted that FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement is not applicable to simplified acquisition.  This notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties  may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-PS-(DE)2006-120-DDC, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Consolidated Operations Acquisition Center, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6042, Bethesda, MD 20892-7902, Attention: Deborah Coulter.

<DESC>Summary:	The Discovery AO is amended to mitigate concerns about the competitive procedures used by NASA Principal Investigators. On or about March 1, 2006, Amendment No. 2 to the NASA Announcement of Opportunity "Discovery Program 2006 and Missions of Opportunity" (NNH06ZDA001O) will be posted on the NASA research opportunity homepage at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ (select “Solicitations” then “Open Solicitations” then “NNH06ZDA001O”).   The short period of time between the issuance of Procurement Notice (PN) 04-11 and the issuance of the Discovery AO raises concerns about the application of PN 04-11 in the Discovery AO.  A deviation from PN 04-11 has been approved to mitigate these concerns.  This deviation is approved only for the Discovery AO.   Appendix B, Section J, Part 8 of the Discovery AO is replaced in its entirety.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate solely with Mainstar Corporation of Chambersburg, PA, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13.106-1(b)(1) as the Contracting Officer has determined that the circumstances of the contract deem only one source reasonably available.  SSA has a requirement to provide maintenance support for the Government-owned Mainstar software products as follows:  (1) Aggregate Backup and Recovery Software (ABARS) including ABARS Manager, (2) ASAP (Automatic Selection and Auditing Program), (3) Incremental ABARS and (4) Catalog Baseline.  

This software is used to support data identification, data backup and data movement for major initiatives, such as, the Backup and Recovery Contingency Processing and the establishment of various LPAR test facilities.  The SSA requires a site license with unlimited use of the software at the National Computer Center (NCC) and a future second site (location to be determined - currently unknown).

The current vendor (Mainstar Corporation) owns all proprietary rights to the software’s source code.  Therefore, Mainstar Corporation is the only known responsible source to provide maintenance support.

The Government anticipates the award of a 5-year firm-fixed price contract for software maintenance support.  Other organizations possessing the requisite expertise and resources are invited to submit information establishing a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement.  Pricing data may be submitted.  Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement.  If SSA does not identify other acceptable sources capable of providing the software maintenance, SSA shall issue a sole source award under FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisitions to Mainstar Corporation.  This is not a request for quotation and the Government does not intend to pay for information received.  Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged.   Respondents will not be notified of the results of information received.  Verbal responses are not acceptable and will not be considered. Responses to this notice must be submitted by March 14, 2006 at 12:00 PM, EST.  

Responses may be sent via E-Mail to the point of contact listed below.  No phone calls or faxes will be accepted and submissions may not exceed 5MB.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The purpose of the study is to monitor the downstream migration of juvenile salmon (smolts), Coho, Chinook, Chum, and Cutthroat, moving through the dam removal area on Goldsborough Creek.  Goldsborough Creek smolt migration data will provide the Corps info rmation regarding the effectiveness the dam removal and placement of cement weirs.  Primarily whether Oncorhynchus spp. (pacific salmon) are able to make it up past the project area as adults to spawn and that smolts are surviving outmigration through the project area.   The approach is to monitor downstream outmigration timing of Coho Salmon smolts using weirs and mark/recapture methodology.  Enumeration and estimation of outmigrating smolts will be used to provide data to estimate natural Coho Salmon production and begin  to form relevant spawning escapement goals.  In the ensuing years adult escapement has been variable and the spawning escapement goals were passive.  Specific objectives of this effort are to determine the current downstream smolt outmigration timing and level of smolt production in Goldsborough, Mill, and Cranberry Creeks in the Hammersly Inlet/Oakland Bay watershed and in Skookum Creek in the Totten/Skookum Inlet watershed.  In addition, the information collected on outmigrants will begin the first step to produce a spawner/recruit relationship that will help set adult spawning escapement goals.

The Natural Resources Conservation Service in Nebraska is anticipating establishment of blanket purchase agreements for the technical review of appraisals.     These appraisals have been or will be completed on land located throughout the state of Nebraska that may be placed under a conservation easement through the Grassland Reserve Program (GRP), Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP), Wetlands Reserve Enhancement Program (WREP), Emergency Watershed Program floodplain Easements (EWP-FPE) or the Farm and Ranchland Protection Program (FRPP).     The purpose of the technical review of appraisals is to provide an opinion of the acceptability of the appraisals that provide a market value of the whole subject property before acquisition of an easement (before value) and an opinion of market value of the whole subject property remaining after the proposed easement has been placed (after value) as of a current date of value minus any adjustments for excess irrigation water to arrive at the effect on value of the easement.     The technical review must be completed in compliance with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions and Supplemental Standards issued by NRCS.     The original appraisal being reviewed will have been completed in compliance with the same standards. We anticipate the need for 80 to 100 technical reviews by June 1, 2006.

<DESC>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is conducting market research for patent application analysis tools for automating a wide range of common patent analysis tasks enabling users to analyze patent applications and extract meaningful information/intelligence. This market research shall be conducted at NO COST TO THE GOVERNMENT. This announcement is a Request For Information (RFI), not a solicitation announcement for proposals, and accordingly, no contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. Strong relationships with industry are a priority of the USPTO, and the USPTO wishes to express its appreciation in advance to all organizations that choose to provide information in accordance with this information request.
 
Background

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is an agency in the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) with its headquarters presently located in Alexandria, Virginia. The mission of the USPTO is the examination and issuance of patents and the examination and registration of trademarks. The USPTO serves the interest of inventors and businesses with respect to their inventions and corporate products, and service identifications. It also advises and assists the bureaus and offices of the Department of Commerce and other agencies of the Government in matters involving intellectual property. 

Currently the USPTO databases house about 7 million patents and over 30 million documents comprising 19 terabytes of storage with 6,000 internal users and 1,500 concurrent public users. There is an ongoing need to examine patent applications, maintain patent quality, and perform patentability analysis.

ALL ANALYSIS TOOL VENDORS ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND TO THIS RFI.  USPTO is considering multiple analysis tools to aid examiners.  It is highly desirable that analysis software products be web-based and platform independent.  The following interest list is not inclusive of all analysis capabilities being sought for consideration. 

Analysis Capabilities Sought But Not Limited To:


1.  Improve retrieval of relevant documents by employing latent semantic analysis techniques and/or conceptual search technology (i.e. concept-based search capability), taxonomy or equivalent.

2.  Provide data mining software for analyzing trends in data.  Data mining of numeric data, categorical data, mixed data, sequence and documents.

3.  Provide text mining that enables optimization of information processing by transforming text into data that can be analyzed for information extraction or automatic classification of documents. 
      -	Improve text mapping, which involves clustering or 
        categorizing documents based on the major concepts that
        are contained within.
      - Create lists of clusters categorizing the documents.


4.  Use advanced semantic, statistical and structural tagging technologies to tag critical information buried within documents.  Also, tag any textual content for re-use.

5.   Provide for Claims Analysis and performing claim searching as follows:

      a. Application Claim Tree Processing capability with
         Hierarchal GUI presentation of a Claims tree:
         - Assist an examiner in quickly identifying 
           restrictions; 
         - Show or Hide dependent claims on all outline levels 
           in the entire claim tree;
         - Provide claim tree versioning to document the 
           original claim tree and claim trees for subsequent
           actions and amendments; and
         - Provide ability to annotate claim trees.

      b. Automatically highlight claims, which may be subject to
         rejections based on: 
         -  35 U.S.C. 112 2nd paragraph (vague and indefinite,   
            or improper claim language, improper Markush    
            Language, improper Jepson claims)
         -  35 U.S.C. 112 1st paragraph (new matter-if linked to
            searching the instant specification)
         -  non-statutory subject matter (e.g. 35 U.S.C. 101
            issues) 

      c.  Automate Double Patenting/Interference searches - link
          to USPTO search databases and provide a result set of
          all applications that have similar claim language.
          -  Automatically generate an Inventor/Assignee search
             with result set. 
          -  Identify the key words used in the claim set and
             provide examiners with draft Interference searches.

       d.  Provide automated claim checks to identify
           discrepancies that are used to denote grammar,
           punctuation or awkward language (translation from
           a foreign document).

      e.  Parse claim set to check for multiple dependencies
          such as claim 4 depending from 1 or 2 or 3. 

6.  Perform real-time, iterative searches of patent data including patent citation search and display.  Iteratively search through generations of patent references and view forward and backward patent references at the same time. 


7.  Ability to develop a custom search loaded with trade journals, all the patent references, all the foreign art, and having references viewed and scrolled through as quickly as 0.5 seconds per page.

8. Interface with existing USPTO automated information systems and search tools which includes but not limited to EAST, WEST, NPL, MPEP Insight, Classification Insight, OACS, eDAN, PLUS, etc.

9.  Search Strategies Profiles to provide the ability to define search strategy once and then execute the search in multiple systems without having to spend time reformatting (transforming) the search criteria (input) for each and every system.  The template can further insure consistent prior art searches by standardizing search strategies.

    -  Integrated user customizable search thesaurus
    -  Relevancy-ranked results 
    -  Boolean and advanced Boolean searching
    -  Proximity searching
    -  Truncations with left, right, and internal
    -  Automatic plurals
    -  British equivalents and abbreviation equivalents
    -  Transparent seamless search integrator that can be used 
       by all designated systems


10.  Product should incorporate full/ perpetual search session history. 

11.  Provide flexible analysis results export.

12.  Provide full-text retrieval.

13.  Provide image analysis capability.

14.  Be easily accessible by all examiners and will scale to at least 6,000 USPTO and 1,500 Public users concurrently.

15.  Prefer that software will run on and not impact the existing hardware platform.  The analysis tool should be compliant with the USPTO Strategic Information Technology Plans posted at http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/cio. 

Additional Information
USPTO may request a demonstration and information exchange meeting with individual respondents based upon interest in applicability of the capability submitted.

<SUBJECT>16 -- HF TOWEL BAR ANTENNA
<SOLNBR>HSCG38-06-Q-200013
<RESPDATE>030306
<CONTACT>Cynthia Soules, HH65 Contract Specialist, Phone 252-335-6641, Fax 252-334-5240, Email Cynthia.D.Soules@uscg.mil
<DESC>This amendment is issued to address questions posed by a prospective offeror:

QUESTION:  Could you tell us the footprint details of the (two?) existing mast interfaces with the HH65 tail cone? We have assumed that one of them is the Collins 437R-2 antenna footprint, but we don't know what the other one is.
ANSWER:  The Collins 437R-2 Monopole antenna (antenna feed) will be removed. The existing long wire antenna is terminated at the stinger (tail skid) with an insulator and a tension adjustor. The stinger is composite material with a metal skid plate on the bottom. This is not the location that we would terminate a towel bar antenna design (too susceptible to damage).

QUESTION:  Are you presently feeding the existing antenna from the front or from the back? 
ANSWER:  Front. Use of existing mount (removed 437R-2) at feed through is a possibility.

QUESTION:  Are the inner and outer metal skins of the tail cone aluminum alloy? If not, what are they?  We note that the SOW, figure 1-90, paragraph 2, indicates that "tail cone panels consist of an inner and outer metal skin with a nomex honeycomb material sandwiched between them. The individual panels are ELECTRICALLY INSULATED FROM ONE ANOTHER for corrosion prevention purposes". 
ANSWER:  The tail cone is nomex composite sheathed in aluminum skin. The fenestron is entirely composite. The statement in fig 1-90, paragraph 2 refers to individual panels such as the tail rotor drive shaft fairings, cowling, heat shield panels, etc.  

QUESTION:  What approach would you prefer to creating a suitable RF conduction loop?
ANSWER:   The Coast Guard is interested in recommendations and any data on previous installations using these techniques. The requirement is long range communication. Near Vertical Incident Skywaves (NVIS) is not the objective. The question is, when using HF frequencies on an ALE network, typically with 10 Channels in the 3-23 Mhz range (most at 9-23 MHz) which configuration would work best? Closed loop or open? 

QUESTION:  Does the geometry of the HH65 indicate it will be necessary to attach anything to the vertical fin? If so, does USCG have any preferred anti-corrosion process, such as ivadizing?
ANSWER:  To achieve the minimum 10 foot requirement the antenna will likely terminated at the fenestron (vertical fin). If a closed loop design is elected, recommendations on how to best achieve the required ground would be expected.  Mediation of corrosion issues fall under the purview of the Coast Guard, however experience and recommendations of attachment hardware are always welcome.

QUESTION:  Would it be possible to visit you to measure and photograph the applicable areas of a USCG HH65 before we complete proposal for your HF Towel Bar antenna?
ANSWER:  Site visits may be coordinated through Mr. Robert Vessey at (252)335-6711.

<DESC>The purpose of the modification to the synopsis is to change the solicitation from being a sole source to open competition and extends the response date to March 7, 2006.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13 (not to exceed $100,000).   This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-08.  The proposed contract is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334513 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Cryogenics Technologies Group requires a closed-cycle cryogenic refrigerator system with relatively high cooling power.  NIST's experiment requirements are 1.5 Watts of cooling power at 4K.  There are other refrigerators that can obtain 4 Kelvin temperatures but providing 1.5 Watts at various positioning is difficult.  NIST’s minimum requirements for the refrigerator are to operate at 4 K with a heat load capacity of 1.5 Watts. The experiments will involve heat loss measurements on regenerator systems using various regenerator designs and materials.  Other cryocooler companies offer low temperature applications but may have difficulty meeting the heat load capacities of 1.5 Watts at the 4.2 K requirements because of experimental design needs. NIST requires the Gifford-McMann (GM) cryocooler technology instead of the pulse tube cryocooler technology because of the physical orientation that will be required for these experiments. NIST needs to operate the system in many different physical directions and the pulse tube design operates efficiently only when in the downward position. NIST needs to operate the cold head in a 360 degree radius, having the cold head of the refrigerator rotate clockwise around a fixed center point. The GM design cryocoolers can operate efficiently with the cold end direction not having any effect on its performance or efficiency. The pulse tube performance and efficiency is affected when it is not operated in the downward position. The performance ratings are based on this position and NIST will not be operating the cryocooler in that position.  Along with not meeting the heat load requirements at 4.2 kelvin the orientation limits of the pulse tube cryocooler would not meet NIST’s experimental requirements. 
Delivery of the refrigerator to NIST is required during or before the last week of March, 2006.  Measurements for the experiments must begin in April and the initial tests will be completed by June. 

The government will award a fixed price purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer will represent the best value to the government, price and other factors considered (delivery schedule and warranty).
Questions should be submitted in writing to the contracting officer either by fax or e-mail before March 7, 2006.  Please include delivery date, F.O.B. point, business size, Federal Taxpayer Identification Number, and Dun and Bradstreet Number.  Vendors must also be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) at www.ccr.gov.  

The following provisions and clauses shall apply to this solicitation:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors – Commercial, applies to this acquisition and there is no addenda to this provision;  FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation – Commercial Items – The government will award a fixed price purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer will represent the best value to the government, price and other factors considered;  FAR 52.212-3,  Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items – Offerors must include a completed copy of Offeror Representations and Certifications along with the offer;  FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition and there is no addenda to this provision;  FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders – Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.

2006 Design-Bid-Build Brussels Chancery Renovation and Rehabilitation Project

CHANCERY RENOVATION  QUALIFICATION ONLY 



THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE (DOS), Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO) is seeking to pre-qualify firms for Design-Bid-Build construction services for the renovation of an existing office building, Bi-lateral Mission Chancery, Brussels, Belgium. The construction contract is expected to be awarded prior to September 30, 2006. Actually, construction is not expected to begin until issuance of a Notice to Proceed. Performance period of this project from Notice to Proceed issuance is anticipated to be 18 months. This project does require the use of cleared American workers. The contract type for this project will be firm fixed-price. Award of this contract is subject to the availability of funds. 



SALMEC-06-R0038: Brussels, Belguim, Chancery Renovation and Rehabilitation: 6,000 gsm, Estimated Bid Build cost range $10 to $15 million.


Background Information

This US Government owned Chancery, constructed by the Department in 1952 is situated on a one-third acre lot.  The 6,000 gsm Chancery is comprised of a seven-story "tower" portion on Boulevard du Regent and a two-story back wing which abuts the CMR. The building forms a "U" shape around a paved interior courtyard and a full basement extends under the entire floor plate of the building including the tower, low wing and courtyard.  This level was originally constructed as a parking garage; evidence of the irregular column spacing and ramps still exist.  A sub-basement was built under the tower portion of the building, which is comprised of the building's mechanical services.

The entire building, with the exception of the top floor was constructed with cast-in-place concrete columns, beams, joists, floor and roof slabs.  The top floor of the tower is framed with structural steel, which is roofed with a concrete slab. The exterior walls of the Chancery are clad with flat (French) limestone panels set in a stacked pattern.  The original aluminum (double insulated glass) windows are set in punched openings.


Project Solicitation

THE PROJECT SOLICITATION WILL CONSIST OF TWO PHASES. This announcement for pre-qualification is Phase I. The Department of State will evaluate and rate the pre-qualification proposals based on the evaluation criteria set forth in the following Pass/Fail Evaluation Factors. Those offerors receiving a satisfactory evaluated rating from the technical board will be issued a formal solicitation (Request for Proposal) and invited to submit proposed pricing in Phase II. The government reserves the right not to pre-qualify any offeror receiving less than a satisfactory rating in any evaluation factor or sub-factor. 

Prior Prequalification

	Prequalifications were done for the NEC projects in Johannesburg, Sarajevo, Harare,  Brazzaville, Libreville, Surabaya, Djibouti, Ouagadougou and Antananarivo and Beirut. Firms found prequalified for the specific individual projects listed in the previous sentence may prequalify for this project by submitting a letter of interest as described below prior to the closure date of this solicitation. Design build firms that submitted a prequalification package for SED design-build projects of similar scope and dollar value during FY 2005 and were successfully pre-qualified by the OBO technical panel need not resubmit a complete pre-qualification package under this announcement. If interested, the previously pre-qualified offerors must send the POC a letter of interest as described below prior to the closure date of this solicitation. 
	
         Letter of Interest:  The letter must be submitted in accordance with  the previous paragraph. However, if any changes have occurred in the construction firm's structure, size status, or team of the construction aspect of the offeror's original design-build pre-qualification package, the offeror must identify the change(s) in the letter for the government to review and evaluate. The government will determine if such changes are acceptable.  Offerors must ensure that they cite the RFP number of the previous pre-qualification solicitation and what specific changes were made since pre-qualification. A change by the contractor must be sent for evaluation to this office regardless of how minor the offeror may believe it is. If no changes have occurred since pre-qualification, the offeror must state this in the letter of interest. Offerors are reminded that the letter of interest is due prior to the closure time and date of this solicitation otherwise the offeror will not be evaluated for pre-qualification for this project.

	Prequalification based on successful prior prequalification for the specific projects list above or based on prequalification in FY 2005 is subject to a satisfactory evaluation of Past and Present Performance as described in Factor 3 below.  Offerors need not provide additional Past Performance information.  The Government will determine the extent to which past performance will be evaluated and the internal and/or external sources from which past performance information will be sought, if any.

Prequalification Requirements

The submissions received in response to the Phase II formal solicitation shall be submitted in the formats provided and will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation procedures contained in the solicitation. Due to time constraints, it is anticipated that the pre-qualified firms will be required to participate in visits to the project sites within 10 to 15 days after the issuance of the design-bid-build RFP. To offset some of the cost of the site visits and other related costs, pre-qualified firms that do not receive the design-bid-build award will be paid $10,000.00 for a fair and reasonable and responsive project proposal they submit in Phase II.

<DESC>BSA has a requirement for a UHV system designed for atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) at variable temperatures, and optimized for operation at temperatures from below 50 Kelvin (K) to at least 650 K. Cooling with liquid helium (LHe) or nitrogen (LN2) of at least the sample shall be possible to achieve stable temperatures below room temperature. Adequate heating shall permit stable microscopy above room temperature. In STM and non-contact AFM mode, the instrument shall be capable of microscopy with atomic resolution on conducting and insulating surfaces. A broad range of AFM imaging modes shall be possible, including contact AFM, lateral force microscopy, magnetic force microscopy, etc. The microscope and its control electronics and software shall be capable of state-of-the-art tunneling and force spectroscopy functions with highest spatial, energy, and force resolution. The instrument shall provide optical access to the sample as well as access ports for exposing the sample to gases or atomic/molecular beams. Samples and probe tips shall be exchangeable in-situ.

The VT-SPM system shall consist of three interconnected, individually pumped UHV subsystems: i) a main chamber holding the AFM/STM microscope; ii) a preparation and analysis chamber holding a manipulator for sample heating and cooling, one ion sputter gun for sample cleaning, one single-pocket electron beam evaporator, and with several additional ports for attaching optional instrumentation for sample preparation, in particular a set of ports suitable for mounting an optional electron energy analyzer and dual anode X-ray source for photoelectron spectroscopy; and iii) one load-lock chamber for fast loading of samples, AFM cantilevers, and STM tips into the system. In addition it shall include all necessary peripheral systems, such as a vibration damping system, and controllers for all system functions. BNL intends to ultimately use in-house developed STM and AFM control electronics to control all imaging and spectroscopy functions of this system. However, the vendor shall provide a STM/AFM controller capable of all pertinent imaging and spectroscopy functions during system installation, training, and for the acceptance tests and demonstration of the specified system performance.

In addition to the manufacturer’s specification for a state-of-the-art VT-SPM system, the instrument shall also be designed to meet BNL’s special requirements delineated herein.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Command, Armament Research Development and Engineering Center (RDECOM-ARDEC), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 seeks to acquire the services of a qualified source to provide final design, fabrication, installation, start-up, testing and operation of a plasma arc thermal treatment system for the demilitarization of military ordnance.  These services are required in order to complete an on-going project to develop a transportable plasma furnace system that will be integrated with  a munitions pre-processing operation known as cryofracture.  Development of  the integrated cryofracture portion of the combined system is the responsibility of others, however, development of the interface between the cryofracture portion of the system and the plasma arc portion of the system will be a shared responsibility under this effort.  The combined plasma arc/cryofracture demilitarization system will be installed and tested at a  DOD facility to be determined at a later date.  This combined cryofracture/plasma arc system, which is presently in the 50% detailed design stage, is intended to enable the safe and complete demilitarization of high explosive-containing submunitions downloaded from Cluster Bomb Units (CBUs) and 105MM/155MM artillery rounds as well as other small ammunition items that are determined to be suitable for processing. The nominal throughput for the process will be approximately 250 lb/hr.  The  overall process involves downloading of the submunitions, handling of the submunitions, cryofracture of the submunitions, transfer of the cryofractured debris into a plasma system, and conversion (via plasma arc treatment) of the debris to a benign solid phase (slag) or recovered metal and a clean effluent gas compliant with environmental emission requirements.  In addition to completing detailed system designs, fabricating, starting-up, demonstrating, and transitioning the system to full scale demil operations, interested  sources would also be responsible for obtaining all required environmental permits and providing training and maintenance documentation.  Integration of  the plasma arc system with the cryofracture portion of the process is also  required.  Sources shall use the existing system design (50% detailed design) as a starting point for developing the complete detailed design package, in order  to minimize technical risk.  If interested, sources should demonstrate experience in the design, fabrication, installation, testing, and prove-out  of plasma systems tailored for the processing of military munitions and should also provide test data supporting the ability to operate plasma furnaces in both oxidizing and reducing environments for a continuous 120 hours without torch electrode replacement.  Sources with experience in the areas cited above should provide a summary of their companyâ€™s capabilities, including  documentation describing actual systems designed, fabricated, installed, started-up, tested, and operated, as well as a description of operating experience including wastes processed, processing rates achieved, operating  hours logged, torch electrode life data, and maintenance issues/malfunctions  encountered.  Interested sources should also provide a description of specifications, brochures, and/or drawings and provide their name, address, point of contact with telephone number and email address and size of  business.   All responses are to be submitted within fifteen days of the date of this notice to US Army TACOM-Picatinny, Picatinny Center for Contracting  and Commerce (PC3), ATTN: Magda Szymanski, AMSTA-AQ-APH, Bldg. 9, Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey 07806-5000, email: mszyman@pica.army.mil.  The POC for  any technical questions is Francis Sullivan at (973) 724-3538.    NAICS Code 541710 is applicable to this Market Survey. This is a market survey for information only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the US Government. The US Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited.

<SUBJECT>63 -- Building Restoration Operations Optimization Model (BROOM)
<DESC>Over the past several years, Sandia National Laboratories in collaboration with DHS partners, have developed significant capabilities to help our nation restore critical facilities following the release of a chemical or biological warfare agent (CBW). This work has focused on the development of a systems approach to restoration, with the objective of reducing the time required to restore critical facilities, filling data gaps that are important to the restoration process, and the development of specific technologies to enhance the restoration process. One of these technologies is the Building Restoration Operations Optimization Model (BROOM). BROOM is a software tool designed to improve the speed and efficiency of cleanup operations following a CBW agent release in an indoor facility.  This multifaceted tool is intended to aid in the collection of surface samples, guide characterization and clearance efforts, manage collected data, and provide a visual interface to this data.  A beta version of the tool, developed under the DHS-funded Biological Restoration Domestic Demonstration and Application Program (DDAP), is now available for testing, evaluation and partnership opportunities.

Partnerships are anticipated to take the form of Cooperative Research and Development (CRADA)Agreements and/or commercial licenses.  CRADAs are anticipated to include funds-in to the Labs and rights licensed may be up to an exclusive right in a designated field-of-use, depending on the business case.  Sandia is seeking partners with demonstrated experience in translating technologies into market-driven products, have relevant technical capabilities and competence in the subject matter, are fiscally sound and well managed, and can commit to product manufacture in the U.S. Copyrights have been secured on this technology.

<SUBJECT>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT BAA-04-02:  SUBMARINE ESCAPE, RESCUE, AND DIVER SAFETY EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWCPC) is soliciting pre-proposals and proposals for applied biomedical research focusing on Submarine Escape and Rescue, and Diving Safety and Effectiveness. The goals of this program are presented in more detail below. It is the intent that this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) be open for a period of two years from the date of this publication (or until 2/06/2006).  However, specified dates are given in paragraph (2) below for submission of pre-proposals and proposals to be awarded within FY 2004 and FY 2005. (1) Primary Interests  This program’s objective is to focus on Submarine Escape, Rescue, and Diver Safety Effectiveness research that can be rapidly transitioned to fleet capabilities by improving procedures or increasing levels of safety and survivability.  The typical project will be two years or less although three y ear projects are considered.  The areas of primary interest in submarine escape and rescue are:  (1) extending the capability for rescue under pressure to 5 ATA through novel means to accelerate or eliminate saturation decompression of survivors; including, but not limited to oxygen and perfluorocarbon administration; (2) evaluation aboard an operational submarine of the adequacy and effectiveness of present stores, guidance and procedures to assure survivability in a disabled submarine for seven days; (3) improving understanding and guidance for thermal stress in a disabled submarine; (4)   improving understanding and guidance for surface interval risk after saturation dropout or aborted decompression, including mitigation with various periods of oxygen breathing; (5) develop guidance and procedures for medical screening of pressurized escape trainees for pulmonary over-inf lation syndrome risk; (6) extending the capability for escape to depths deeper than 600 feet through improved escape procedures and equipment; (7) improved senior survivor decision tools;  (8) improving critical care of escape and rescue casualties within the U.S. Navy Submarine Rescue Diving and Recompression System. The areas of primary interest in diving safety and effectiveness are:  (1) development of new decompression models that improve safety, reduce decompression time, and track nitrogen and helium simultaneously; such models should allow integration across the full spectrum of diving including single and multilevel dives, repetitive dives, and surface-decompression dives; (2) improved equipment and procedures for contaminated water diving, development of  field-deployable screening tests for biologic and chemical contamination, improved laboratory assays for contam inants in salt and brackish water and development of decontamination techniques, including rapid decontamination techniques that will allow employment of surface decompression tables, and improved risk assessment and management techniques; current contaminated water scenarios of greatest interest are fuel oils, human remains, Polychlorinated Biphenyls, and heavy metals; (3) improved understanding of short and long term  oxygen toxicity associated with prolonged and repeated exposure to increased partial pressure of oxygen, including pulmonary oxygen toxicity and myopia; (4) improved active and/or passive diver thermal protection for free swimming divers, to extend effective dive duration and operational performance through improved suit and insulating materials; (5) develop and/or refine noise protection exposure limits, monitoring and protection across the spectrum of underwat er sound, including underwater blast and impulse noise; (6) develop improved procedures for shallow nitrogen-oxygen saturation diving including downward excursion dive capability on helium-nitrogen-oxygen mixtures and accelerated nitrogen-oxygen saturation decompression; (7) develop no-decompression curves for no-stop downward excursion dives on helium-oxygen from helium-oxygen saturation storage depths of 300 feet of seawater and less; (8) assessment of the long term health of divers; including but not limited to hearing, dysbaric osteonecrosis, neuropsychological disorders and neuropathies; (9) improved diagnosis of decompression illness through utilization of algorithms; (10) electronic recording and archiving of operational dive profiles to develop an operational dive data base; (11) improved understanding of the relationship between patent foramen ovale and decompression s ickness and cerebral arterial gas embolism; (12) develop guidance for hydration to decrease or eliminate over-hydration associated immersion pulmonary edema; (13)  refine the understanding of hypercapnia in divers through direct measurement of arterial carbon dioxide tension under immersed hyperbaric conditions, and development of predictive equations relating end-tidal carbon dioxide tension to arterial tension as a means to estimate arterial carbon dioxide tension accurately and non-invasively.  (2) Instructions for Preparation of Pre-proposal and Proposals  For FY04, the deadline for submission of pre-proposals  is 3:00 PM CST, 26 March 2004 for the funding cycle that began 1 October 2004, and the deadline for submission of full technical proposals is 3:00 PM CST, 7 June 2004. For FY05, the deadline for submission of pre-proposals is 3:00 PM CST, 25 March 2005 for the  funding cycle that begins 1 October 2005, and the deadline for submission of full technical proposals is 3:00 PM CST, 8 June 2005. Proposals received after the due date will be considered only if funds remain available. The format for pre-proposals and proposals may be obtained from the Program Assistant, Lisa Williams at 850-230-3205 or E-mail: lisa.m.williams@navy.mil.  The Pre-proposal should be three five pages of text and should include an estimate of overall costs (including indirect) for each year of the proposed effort.  A curriculum vitae of the principal investigator(s) should be appended together with any supporting information, such as reprints or preprints, which will assist in the evaluation of the pre-proposal.  Offerors submitting the most promising pre-proposals will be invited to submit a full technical and cost proposal on all or part of their pre-proposal su bmission. However, any such invitation does not assure a subsequent award.  Any offeror may submit a full technical proposal even if its pre-proposal was not identified as promising or if no pre-proposal is submitted; however any full proposal submission would be made without the benefit of feedback prior to full proposal submission.  A completed animal use protocol with supporting documentation is required when animals are employed.  Any proposal that involves the experimental use of human subjects must include a separate evaluation of proposed technical approaches and associated risks by the contractor’s committee for protection of human subjects.  This evaluation must conform with current Department of the Navy instructions relating to the use of human subjects.  Offerors must state in their pre-proposals and full proposals that it is submitted in response to this BAA.  This  BAA provides no funding for pre-proposals or subsequent proposal development purposes.  All pre-proposals will be acknowledged.  Proposals will not be returned after evaluation.  (3) Criteria for Selecting Proposals, their Relative Importance, and the Method of Evaluation  Pre-proposal and full technical proposal submissions will be evaluated on (1) the overall basis of innovation and scientific merit; (2) the relevance to submarine escape, rescue, and diving; (3) the overall value and affordability of the proposal; and (4) the offeror’s capabilities, strengths and weaknesses or unique combinations of these that are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives.  The Government reserves the right to select for funding any, all, part or none of the responses received. For efforts funded as contracts, evaluation of the socio-economic merits will include the extent  of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities.  This is to notify potential offerors that each contract that may be placed under this announcement, or solicitation to an institution of higher education must include the following clause:  “As a condition for receipt of funds available to the Department of Defense (DoD) under this award, the recipient agrees that it is not an institution that has a policy of denying, and that it is not an institution that effectively prevents the Secretary of Defense from obtaining for military recruiting purposes: (A) an entry to campuses or access to students on campuses; or (B) access to directory information pertaining to students.  If the recipient is determined, using procedures establ ished by the Secretary of Defense to implement Section 558 of Public Law 103-337 (1994), to be such an institution during the period of performance of this agreement, and therefore to be in breach of this clause, the Government will cease all payments of DoD funds under this agreement and all other DoD grants and cooperative payments unilaterally for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of award.” If your institution has been identified under the procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement Section 558, then: (1) no funds available to DoD may be provided to your institution through any contract, including any existing contract, (2) as a matter of policy, this restriction also applies to any cooperative agreement, and (3) your institution is not eligible to receive a contract or cooperative agreement in response to this solicitation." See  instructions above for pre-proposals and proposals. The Government’s preference is to award definitive contracts under this BAA. However, an award can be made via grant at the sole discretion of the Government.  All responsive sources may submit proposals that will be considered by NSWCPC. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals or join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete and severable areas of submarine escape, rescue, and diving for exclusive competition among these entities.  This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d) (2) (i).  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals receive d in response to this announcement. Questions regarding this announcement should be directed to the Contract Specialist identified herein.

<SUBJECT>A -- Whole Air Sampling and Chemical Analysis of Volatile Organic Compounds during the TexAQSII 2006 Field Study
<DESC>In the absence of other qualified sources, it is the intent of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL)/Chemical Sciences Division (CSD) to negotiate with the University of Miami, located at 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, Florida for Whole Air Sampling and Chemical Analysis of Volatile Organic Compounds during the TEXAQSII 2006 Field Study.    BACKGROUND:  NOAA is conducting a major field study in east Texas during the summer of 2006 in collaboration with several U.S. federal agencies, foreign research institutions, and university researchers.  During this study a NOAA WP-3D research aircraft will be used to perform chemical and meteorological measurements throughout the study region.  To meet the study objectives this aircraft will be equipped with a comprehensive array of chemical and meteorological sensors.  These instruments have been specifically designed or modified for use on NOAA's WP-3D research aircraft.     REQUIREMENT:  NOAA requires a contractor with a flight-ready instrument capable of collecting 80 Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) samples per flight using remotely-actuated, electropolished, stainless steel canisters during the 2006 field study in eastern Texas August 1 – September 15, 2006.   The system must be completely autonomous and certified for operation in the unpressurized AMPS-ESI wing pod on the NOAA WP-3D research aircraft.  The samples collected must be analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry with seven days of collection and individual VOCs quantified.  The contractor will be required to provide preliminary services leading up to the study (instrument calibration, integration into the aircraft payload. etc.) and sample analysis during and after the study.  The contractor will also be required to perform data reduction and analysis after the collection of the data.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  The contract to be negotiated shall run from 06/01/2006 through 05/30/2008.  There will be two periods of performance.  The base period (06/01/2006 - 05/30/2007) will cover the following five tasks:  (1) Instrument preparation of sample canisters, (2) Participation in test flights,  (3) Collection of samples during field campaign, (4) Determination of trace gas concentrations and (5) Preparation and delivery of analytical results to data archive. The option period (06/01/2007 - 05/30/2008) will cover the final task (6) Data Analysis, presentation and publication.    SOLE SOURCE:  The only contractor that can provide these services for the 2006 field study is the University of Miami (UM) for the following reasons:  A.   UM currently owns the only VOC sampling system certified for operation on the NOAA WP-3D research aircraft in the AMPS-ESI wing pod.  B.  The UM VOC sampling system is called a Whole Air Sampler (WAS).  The WAS is capable of collecting 80 VOC samples per flight using stainless steel electropolished canisters.    C.  The WAS is capable of autonomous as well as remotely triggered on-demand sampling.  D.  UM has the facilities and staff necessary to provide rapid transportation, sample analysis and canister cleaning for the collected samples.  E.  UM employs Dr. Elliot Atlas, an expert in VOC collection and data analysis.  Dr. Atlas developed the WAS system and has successfully operated it on prior NOAA missions.  Dr. Atlas has demonstrated his expertise in the interpretation of VOC data, including an understanding of the role of these compounds in the complex chemistry of ozone and fine particle formation through an extensive publication record in the peer-reviewed literature.  In summary, the University of Miami is the only responsible source to provide the needed instrument and services for the NOAA mission requirements.  This is not a formal solicitation.  This notice may represent the only notice.  See Numbered Note 22.  AWARD WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS.

<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY, LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LABORATORY, AND SANDIA NATIONAL LABORATORY ANNOUNCE THE INTENT TO APPLY TO DEVELOP USER FACILITY TO PRODUCE AND CHARACTERIZE MICROBIAL PROTEINS AND MOLECULAR TAGS
 
Announcement:  The Biological Foundry Partnership (BFP) is a cooperative association of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), and Sandia National Laboratory (SNL).  LLNL and LBNL are national security laboratories managed as government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO), federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)/National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). SNL is a government-owned/contractor operated (GOCO) facility managed by Sandia Corporation, a Lockheed Martin Company, for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)/National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). As the three national laboratories are each federally funded research and development centers, each laboratory and the BFP is bound by fairness of opportunity requirements and Federal Acquisition Regulations (FARs).

  Department of State, Office of Logistics Management, Acquisition Management, 
  P.O. Box 9115 Rosslyn Station, Arlington, VA, 22219

Description

  This public announcement is being issued as required by the Office of 
  Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 (Revised), dated May 29, 2003.     
  The U.S. Department of State (DoS) announces its intent to conduct an A-76 
  competition to determine whether the work described below in support of the 
  Human Resources Career Development & Assignments Division (HR   CDA) will be performed by the Federal Government or by a private source.  The duration of competition will be 18 months (if needed), with a performance announcement expected on or about 15 March 2006.     

 DoS/HR CDA consists of two units, the Assignment Officer Unit and the Assignment Technician Unit, composed of 17 full time equivalents.

  DoS/HR CDA intends to conduct this acquisition using the Standard Competition 
  Procedures as provided in the OMB Circular A-76.  Further, the intent is to 
  make one award to a single service provider who would be responsible for 
  providing all of the technical and business services under study.   HR CDA does 
  not intend to make separate awards for each business and technical service 
  under study.   In general, the selected business and technical services 
  under study and type of work to be performed under each service area include 
  the following:
  	
Assignment Officer Unit:  Assignment Officers (AOs) have Bureaus as their “clients,” representing all regional and functions Bureaus in the assignments process.  AOs present the Bureau views at assignment panels.  They counsel and advise Bureaus on HR/CDA policies and procedures throughout the bidding cycle, bring bureau candidates to panel, ensure all eBid entries are accurate, recruit for hard-to-fill positions, and negotiate timing and training schedules during the summer transfer season.  The unit also prepares the Bidding Tool, the bid audit program in eBid (formerly “bid count cable”), and oversees the hard-to-fill exercise and the service-need-differential and out-year-world-language programs.

Assignment Technician Unit:  Assignment Technicians issue post assignment travel authorizations (formerly TMFOURS) for employees transferring from one assignment to another, for appointment, separation and home leave/round trip travel, and advance and separate maintenance travel for eligible family members.  They provide 
advice related to shipment allowances and access to storage as outlined in the travel orders.  Technicians process reassignment personnel actions upon receipt of the arrival notification as well as certain other types of personnel actions.  Upon receipt of a Residence and Dependence Report (OF-126), technicians approve and enter into the system changes in eligible family member status, as well as changes in home leave, legal residence, and service separation addresses.  They prepare requests for passport services (DS-1640) to enable transiting employees and eligible family members to obtain diplomatic passports and visas.  Technicians are not responsible for Personnel Actions related to appointments, promotions, within-grade increases (unless the due date is wrong), awards, benefits, or retirement actions, or for corrections in the payroll system that are not controlled by the employee’s location.  They also cannot locate or track shipments.  However, technicians can tell you whom to contact for these services.  Clients are currently divided alphabetically regardless of grade or skill code.

Approximately 17 full-time equivalents are currently performing these selected activities (9 civil servants and 8 foreign service personnel).  The U.S. Department of State office of Human Resources Career Development & Assignments Assignment Division is currently operated out of Washington, D.C.

The Competitive Sourcing Official (CSO) for the Agency is Frank Coulter, Assistant Secretary for Administration (Acting).  The Agency Tender Official (ATO) is Maurice Parker, HR CDA Director; and the Contracting Officer (CO) is James S. (Steve) Rogers.

Potential offers are encouraged to monitor this web site for additional information regarding this procurement.  All questions concerning this matter shall be submitted in writing to Mr. Rogers, Contracting Officer, at rogersjs@state.gov.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-08.

The Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Ohio State Office intends to award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) to small business sources capable of providing real estate appraisals throughout the state of Ohio for a period of approximately three years.  A BPA does not obligate the Government to order or the vendor to furnish any articles of any quantity except to the extent that may be agreed upon in connection with individual transactions.  Obligation is made at the time of an actual order.

Appraisers shall be a State Certified General Real Property Appraiser or obtain a temporary practice permit in Ohio and be in good standing with the licensing authority where the credential was issued.  Appraisers must demonstrate competency in compliance with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) in conducting appraisals of agricultural properties with and without conservation easements of the requested type.  All appraisals completed for this program shall comply with USPAP, Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions (USAFLA aka Yellow Book) and Supplemental Standards as issued by NRCS.

USDA NRCS is also seeking sources capable of providing technical appraisal reviews of appraisals done by other vendors within the state of Ohio.  Review Appraisers shall be a State Certified General Real Property Appraiser and be in good standing with the licensing authority where the credential was issued.  The review appraiser must have demonstrated competency in compliance with USPAP in conducting appraisal reviews of agricultural properties with and without conservation easements of the requested type.  Documentation of appraisal education courses attended such as eminent domain or conservation easements and UASFLA course and at least 40 hours of training in conducting technical reviews shall be provided by the review appraiser to the authorized official.

This is 100% set-aside for small-business.  The associated NAICS code is 531320 and the small business size standard is $1.5 million in average annual receipts.

The provisions at FAR 52.212-1 and 52.212-2 apply to this solicitation.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: price: technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement; past performance (see FAR 15.304)

The clause at FAR 52.212-4 applies to this acquisition.  The clause at FAR 52.212-5 applies (attached).  Additional terms and conditions may be contained in the attached contract clauses.

Multiple awards will be considered.  We will use Optional Form 347 for the award document.  Task orders/delivery orders will be issued in letter form.

For planning purposes there are approximately 25 appraisals to be completed before September 30, 2006.  History for the last three years is as follows:  FY 2003-24 appraisals; FY-2004-21 appraisals; and FY 2005-24 appraisals.  Changes in the policy require the new appraisals be divided into two parts.  The firs part will be on the entire parcel (not just the WRP area) to appraise it for market value before the easement.  The second part of the appraisal will be on the whole parcel after the easement is in place, the after value.  Technical review will be conducted on the first appraisal from all appraisers and 10% of all appraisals after the first.  An in house administrative review will be conducted on all appraisals.

Interested vendors should reply in writing to the Contracting Officer listed below not later than April 7, 2006, 1:00pm E.S.T.  Offers should be addressed to the following:  USDA, NRCS, 200 North High Street, Rm. 522, Columbus, Ohio 43215, Attn: B. Clayton.  Place the solicitation number in the upper left hand corner of the envelope.  Quotes are requested for the following.

1)	Real Estate Appraisal-(Market Value-before value/worth of Property with Easement-after value). 1 JOB; 2) Technical Review 1 JOB

All deliverables are FOB Destination.

Include pricing for those types of appraisals that you are interested in performing.  (NOTE:  It is not necessary to bid on both items to be considered for an award.)  In addition, please provide: documentation of appraisal education courses attended, such as eminent domain or conservation easements, and Yellow Book course; the attached reference form for a minimum of three references; the counties or location preferences for appraisals; and, the counties or location preferences for review appraisals.  See Attachments 5 and 6.  Complete and provide the provision at FAR 52.212-3 along with  your offer.

Telephone and fax inquiries will not be honored.  Email all questions to Barbara.Clayton@oh.usda.gov Contracting Officer.

All contractors must register in the Central Contractor’s Registration database at www.ccr.gov.  The CCR Customer Assistance Center can be contacted toll free at: 1-888-227-2423.

It’s a good idea for anyone who is submitting a quote to begin this process as soon as possible since it can take several days to complete.  Failure to register by close of business on the third day after notification of possible award b y the Contracting Officer, may cause rejection of your offer.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-06-K-625582 for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Quotations incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-19.  This is small business set-aside procurement.  The NAICS is 721110.  
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.
Award will be based on the following criteria:  Price and Past Performance experience will be evaluated.  Offerors are cautioned that the government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussion with offerors.  Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain its best terms.  The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5.

SYSLOG (RFC 3153) alarm reporting
Description:   
Source telemetry signal, as clock & data, is input to the TSIM where it is converted to ATM cells using standard circuit emulation techniques. The TSIM has two modes of operation: standard & low delay.  In standard mode it generates AAL1 cells compliant with I363.1. In low delay mode, streams of less than 8 Kb/s are encoded as partially filled ATM cells to minimize delay.  TSIM supports synchronous clock mode on the input ports.  Upon receipt of the ATM cells, the telemetry source is reconstructed. The TSIM supports adaptive clock mode on the output ports.  In the adaptive clock mode, the TSIM uses adaptive clock techniques to regenerate the source clock.  An adaptive algorithm makes use of a deep jitter buffer to mediate the effects of CDV on data stability.  The depth of the jitter buffer is programmable to allow the user to optimize for CDV tolerance and delay.  The synchronous clock mode allows the transport of telemetry streams to be synchronized to the network.  All relevant alarms and statistics for proper operation and maintenance of the TTL TSIM are available remotely via a web-based browser interface.  The TMS provides remote management, complete service provisioning, fault & performance management and software administration capabilities for the TTL TSIM.

52.232-33 Mandatory information for electronic funds transfer payment.  Before we can begin the contracting process with your company, I need the following online Representations & Certifications Application (ORCA) completed--- http://orca.bpn.gov/. For MPIN registration---http://www.ccr.gov/mpin.asp/.  Use of online reps & certs application (ORCA) became mandatory 1 Jan. 2005.  ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes, standardizes, and moves the collection and storing of FAR level representations and certifications online.  Reps & Certs are to be completed at least annually by vendors online through the ORCA portion of the Business Partner Network (BPN).  Contractors, presently registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR), can get a head start by going to www.bpn.gov/orca/ to activate their ORCA profiles.

Contractors shall ensure their employees and those of their subcontracts have the proper credentials allowing them to work in the United States.  Persons later found to be undocumented or illegal aliens will be remanded to the proper authorities.

For three of the five years immediately prior to submission of an offer/bid/quote, or prior to performance under a contract or commitment, individuals or contractor employees providing services must have:

	1. legally resided in the United States (U.S.);
	2. worked for the U.S. overseas in a Federal or military capacity; or
	3. been a dependent of a Federal or military employee serving overseas.

If the individual is not a U.S. citizen, they must be from a country allied with the U.S.  The following website provides current information regarding allied countries: http://www.opm.gov/employ/html/citizen.htm.

By signing this contract or commitment document, or by commencing performance, the contractor agrees to this restriction.

NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (OCT 2005)

Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201)1 entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I.
 
1.	Long-Term Contractor Personnel: 

In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:     

a.	Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB  No. 1615-0047,  " Employment Eligibility Verification, "  and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);

b.	Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents.  This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;

c.	Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position.  Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:  
 
	•	High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)
	•	Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)
	•	Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation
    
d.	The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a:  

	1)	Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; 
	2)	Favorable fingerprint results; 
	3)	Favorable credit report, if required;3 
	4)	Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and 
	5)	Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC)4 portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level.  

	A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements. 
 
	If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM ' s scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). 
 
e.	Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated.  If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.
 
2.	Short-Term Contractor Personnel:  

It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above.  The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are:
 
a.	Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; 
b.	Favorable fingerprint results; 
c.	Favorable credit report, if required;5 and 
d.	Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment.  The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated.  

A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance.  This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period.  This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process. 
For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements.  However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered “long-term” and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy.  

3.	Intermittent Contractors:

An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors.  

a.	For purposes of this policy, “intermittent” is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access.  For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract.  
b.	Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department’s escort policy.  Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access.   

c.	Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required.

e.	If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year.  If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year. 
  
4.	An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements.  

5.	The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice.
