<DESC>SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION FOR TELEMENTRY UNITThe Detroit VA Medical Center, 4646 John R Street, Detroit, MI 48201 intends to negotiate a sole source procurement with Telemetry Research Limited, 70 Symonds Street, Ackland, New Zealand.  The proposed contract action is for the purchase of a SNA Pressure Transmitter, Pressure & Biopotential master receiver controller, pressure and biopotential subreceiver, wireless power supplier, blood pressure consumable pack, sna consumable pack, power lab 8/30 with lab chart pro, scheduler pod ML319, 46 SP SNA and pressure transmitter (small) (2 ea).  The SNA pressure biopotential system has unique abilities needed to perform cutting edge experiments.  It should have the ability to assess sympathetic nerve activity recordings in conscious freely moving rats 24 hrs a day X 7 days per week for up to several months, have the ability to recharge the transmitters while they remain in the rats with a wireless power charger using inductive power transfer.  It needs to have reduction of handling induced stress artifact in nerve conduction/activity experiments, limited costs of recharging transmitters, be able to house rats together (two to three per cage).  It must have the ability to perform chronic nerve experiments and the ability to perform sequential experiments over time which permits the animals to act as their own controls.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-3 (a) (2) (ii).  All FAR provisions and clauses may be reviewed and/or obtained from the General Service Internet address http://www.arnet.gov/far.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334611 Software Reproducing with a size standard of 500 employees. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Avetech Solutions of Owings Mills, MD for Archibus Software Support Services and Training with a one year base period plus 2 option years.
The U.S. EPA believes that Avatech is the only source capable of providing this support service and training.  At the EPA, ARCHIBUS/FM and its modules are not just used by themselves in a standalone fashion.  The EPA has integrated ARCHIBUS/FM into our Oracle database infrastructure, our Cold Fusion Web development environment and all our Web applications (e.g., RTP Locator, Property Management Database, Service Call Tracking, Work Order Tracking).  This situation causes our software installation and support structure to be non-standard, not `out of the box?.  Another firm, technician or developer can?t simply take the ARCHIBUS/FM upgrade CDs, plug them into our environment, and perform an upgrade because there is unique scripting and customization in place that has to be accounted for before new versions of ARCHIBUS/FM or its modules can be installed or updated.  
Since this procurement is considered a commercial service, simplified procurement procedures will be used in accordance with FAR 13.5. The base period of performance is expected to be from November 01, 2008 through October 31, 2009. All interested parties who believe that they can provide these required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement.
The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any other sources exist and, therefore, no Request For Quote (RFQ) is available at this time unless the interested party provides the aforementioned information. Consequently, any responses that fail to provide the aforementioned information and instead just request a copy of the RFQ, will not be honored. Submittals should be made to Dan Neustedter (919-541-4749) via e-mail at neustedter.dan@epa.gov.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for Market Research purposes only.  The National Science Foundation (NSF) is seeking qualified sources for science, operations, maintenance, information technology, communications, engineering and construction support for the United States Antarctic Program (USAP).  The USAP represents the national effort for scientific research in Antarctica.  Individuals from various U.S. academic institutions, working under grants awarded by NSF, and personnel from other federal agencies perform research and specialized services in the Antarctic under USAP auspices.  The contractor’s primary role is to provide the aforementioned support for individuals deploying to Antarctica -- including deploying the researchers and their cargo, ensuring their survival and safety, and enabling the performance of field and laboratory work while deployed.  The primary function is performed within the context of sustaining the existing infrastructure, and establishing new support facilities and/or capabilities as required by the NSF.  To perform these functions the Government provides substantial support from its own resources (primarily property, equipment, and transportation).  Presently, operations are staged from Port Hueneme, CA; Christchurch, New Zealand; and Punta Arenas, Chile.  The USAP maintains three permanent stations in Antarctica: McMurdo Station on Ross Island at 77° 51’S, 166° 40’E; Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station at 90°S; and Palmer Station on Anvers Island at 64° 46’S, 64° 03’W.  Other camps and locations are occupied on a seasonal or temporary basis.  Oceanographic research is performed from the Ice Breaking Research Vessels Nathaniel B. Palmer and Laurence M. Gould.   

A draft Statement of Objectives is attached to provide respondents a better understanding of the needs of the USAP and the respondent’s potential ability to meet NSF’s requirement.  The purpose of this synopsis is to identify interested vendors – large businesses, small businesses, non-profits or other interested parties and to determine if a set-aside is warranted.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561210 - Facilities Support Services, which has a small business size standard of $32.5M.  Only a brief statement of qualifications (not to exceed ten (10) pages) is requested at this time.  At a minimum, provide the following information in your submittal:  1) Name of company; 2) Name of company’s point of contact, including address, phone, and e-mail;  3) Identify the type of entity (large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, non-profit institutions, woman-owned small business, HUBZone small business or service disabled veteran-owned small business, and also indicate if the firm is foreign-owned); and, 4)  Identify intent to team, and, if possible, the anticipated teaming arrangement.   Interested small businesses should review and understand the requirements in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 19 and FAR clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.  In addition, the statement of qualifications should include information that clearly demonstrates the respondent's capabilities, expertise and experience to perform the requirements, or serve as a prime systems integration contractor to perform the requirements, contained in the draft Statement of Objectives.  General marketing material should not be included.  

The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this Sources Sought Synopsis nor will it reimburse the respondent for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice.  This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Quotation (RFQ), Request for Proposal (RFP), or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does this issuance restrict the Government’s acquisition approach. The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or in part any industry input as a result of this announcement.  The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of your submittal.  If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information.  

All submittals received will be reviewed for informational purposes.  NSF reserves the right to independently verify all information submitted.  Interested vendors are encouraged to identify themselves as such at the FedBizOpps website for purposes of furthering teaming arrangements and subcontracting opportunities.  Submittals may be made individually or as a prospective team.  Send submittals to: National Science Foundation, Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support,  ATTN: Ms. Karen Millisor, Contracting Officer, 4201 Wilson Blvd, Arlington, VA 22230 or e-mail to kmilliso@nsf.gov.  Submittals are requested within 15 calendar days from publication of this synopsis.  Telephone responses and inquiries will not be accepted.  An advisory multi-step process may be employed as part of this acquisition (see FAR Subpart 15.202) at a later date.  A tentative milestone schedule for the USAP competition along with other USAP information can be located at the USAP website at http://www.nsf.gov/about/contracting/rfqs/support_ant/index.jsp.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-26.     

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This synopsis, NAICS code 541711, is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 for the following statement of work, under the simplified acquisition procedures. This is a total small business set-aside.  Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and any amendments.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any amendments to this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary. 

This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) for a firm-fixed price base year and one option year.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a purchase order for services for predictive value of systems biology for relatively rare cardiovascular adverse events: prospective evaluation. The Statement of Work is as follows:

Background:

The modern clinical trial is the international gold standard for evaluating the safety and efficacy of new therapies.  While this evaluation tool provides the objective evidence upon which regulatory approval is based, practical limitations on the study size, duration and subject population leave uncertainties regarding safety that cannot be fully answered until a drug is in use by a large, heterogeneous population.  Clinical trials are neither powered nor designed to detect rare serious adverse events.
When planning the later phases of drug development (phase III and IV), having information that may be predictive of likely adverse events could be extremely valuable in guiding the design of clinical trials and post-market safety studies.  Models that can simulate the effects of activating a drug target on the physiology and biochemistry of normal and diseased humans, while not providing information sufficient to make a regulatory decision, may provide information that is helpful in refining development and post-market surveillance plans on potential safety concerns.
One area of science that has the potential to provide useful predictive value in drug evaluation is systems biology. Systems biology ideally seeks to understand complex biological systems in their entirety by integrating all levels of functional information into a cohesive model. Platforms are based on mathematical descriptions of known functions and behaviors of biological components linked into complex models that allow for the dynamic interaction of large numbers of variables.  The science of systems biology has evolved rapidly in recent years, due in part to increasing computational power and the ease of amassing comprehensive information on an organism’s genes, proteins, metabolic pathways, transporters, and other components.  
Systems biology has matured to the point it is now being applied to simulations of clinical trials.    By introducing the ability to alter physiological parameters to reflect values seen in disease states, it is possible to build dynamic large scale computer models of human disease.  Further, by creating a large number of models with a range of parameters that reflect the heterogeneity of healthy and diseased individuals, it is possible to build a population of unique virtual subjects.  Activating a drug target in this virtual population and following the temporal changes this induces in key variables allows for simulation of a clinical trail.  Each trial can have a potentially unlimited number of subjects representing commonly encountered subpopulations (e.g. diabetics).
While systems biology is a potentially useful tool in evaluating the safety and efficacy of drugs, the utility has not been evaluated in a regulatory context.  This project would test the predictive value of a systems biology simulation of an ongoing outcomes clinical trial, using a virtual patient population that reflects the variation of the actual subject population.

Objective:

A.	To develop a systems biology simulation of the effects of specific drugs within a predetermined class in order to model the safety and effectiveness of these drugs, as well as identify potential biomarkers predictive of responder/non-responder and adverse responder.
B.	To simulate the clinical efficacy-safety profile (efficacy endpoints, adverse events, incidence) in a selected organ system of a drug in development. The simulated subject population will approximate the variability in the actual clinical trial population. 
C.	Evaluation of the validity of the modeling approach by comparing simulated efficacy and safety to the clinical trial results in terms of the population profiles and individual responses.

Scope of Work:

The FDA will select a drug class and a set of drugs within that class for which it has ongoing clinical trials. The contractor shall conduct a systems biology evaluation of the selected drugs to determine if the safety issues associated with each drug are compound-specific, or a class effect. The contractor shall model different scenarios/compounds with differing PK/PD and receptor binding characteristics providing a preliminary assessment of the safety & efficacy profiles of each drug. The contractor shall provide a simulated risk profile of the drugs. In addition, candidate biomarkers will be identified to differentiate patients who are likely to benefit from a drug (responders) from patients who do not respond, or who are exposed to a higher risk (adverse responders) due to specific drugs.

In the second phase, the contractor shall construct a virtual clinical trial population based on a range of subject characteristics with variability specified by the FDA.  This virtual population will be used to conduct virtual clinical trials with a trial design and characteristics specified by the FDA.  The contractor shall provide the FDA with statistical summaries of the trial results, as well as individual virtual subject level data and will provide a prediction of rare and serious adverse events and identify biomarkers that may identify subjects who will benefit as well as those who may be at increased risk of an adverse event.

EVALUATION FOR AWARD

Basis for Award:

a.       Proposals received will first be evaluated from a technical standpoint without regard to proposed cost.  Those proposals considered to be technically acceptable will then be evaluated from a financial and management standpoint.

b.       Technical factors are significantly more important than cost or price.  It is pointed out, however, that should technical competence between offerors be considered approximately the same, then cost or price could become primary.

c.       FDA will base its award decision using a best value analysis that results in the most advantageous acquisition for the government.  FDA’s acquisition strategy used to obtain best value may result in an award to other than the lowest priced, technically rated offeror.  Best value analysis spans a continuum from the lowest priced, technically acceptable proposal to those proposals in which tradeoffs between price, past performance, and each offeror’s technical solution is evaluated.  This tradeoff process (see FAR 15.101-1) depends on the government’s assessment of quality factors, including but not limited to past performance, compliance with solicitation requirements, technical excellence, management capability, personnel qualifications and prior experience, and price.

<DESC>****************************The purpose of this amendment is to extend the due date from Wednesday, September 3, 2008 to Friday, September 5, 2008.  All other terms and conditions remain unchanged at this time. ***********************************Description
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This synopsis, NAICS code 541611, is to notify contractors that the government is seeking competition in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 for the following statement of work, under the simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-26.  This is a total small business set-aside.  Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and any amendments. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any amendments to this solicitation. Hard copies will be provided to individuals eligible under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act upon request. The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary. 

STATEMENT OF WORK: Background:

For over 30 years the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance (DSMICA) has assisted industry by providing technical and regulatory assistance to small manufacturers to help them comply with FDA requirements for medical devices. DSMICA is one of several divisions within the Office of Communication, Education, and Radiation Programs, within the Center For Devices & Radiological Health (CDRH).  DSMICA has five major programs:

1)  Educates and advises the device industry and helps them comply with a wide array of FDA regulations; 

2)  Educates consumers about issues and problems with medical devices and radiation-emitting products:

3)  Educates and trains foreign government officials on the US regulatory process;

4)  Coordinates global harmonization, Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRA) and other international agreements; and

5)  Manages the CDRH Third Party Program.

DSMICA’S staff answers questions by phone, FAX, E-mail, and in person.  They are professionals trained in device laws, regulations and procedures. They quickly provide “real time” answers to most questions. DSMICA develops and makes available electronically a wide variety of “How To” guidance to help industry comply with regulatory requirements. Examples include premarket notification [510(k)], premarket approval (PMA), investigational device exemptions (IDE), good manufacturing practices (GMP/QS), establishment registration and device listing, and Electronic Product (Radiation emitting) submissions. DSMICA staff routinely participates at workshops, symposiums, seminars, and conferences speaking on medical device and radiological health regulations. 

At this time we are exploring the use of contractors to provide cost effective responses to email inquiries from consumers and other non-industry stakeholders.  The contractor could perform this work at DSMICA offices in Rockville or at a location of their choosing, within EST time zone.

Scope of Work 
We are seeking the use of contractors to provide time effective responses to email inquiries from consumers and other non-industry stakeholders relative to program 2 above.  The contractor could perform this work at DSMICA offices in Rockville or at a location of their choosing, within EST time zone.

The contractor will assist DSMICA by responding to the needs and concerns from industry in “real time” by addressing the inquirers concerns/questions primarily in directing them to publicly available information maintained on the public FDA web sites or via other public sources. 

The contractor may also use boilerplate information such as our “A2 package” or other precedent documents.

The contractor will copy the DSMICA account on all responses to allow FDA to track and monitor their activities.  DSMICA expects no less than 90% of inquiries to be responded to with 48 hours (2 business days) of receipt of the inquiry.

The following are examples of typical questions the contractor will be expected to reply to and the typical source for that answer:

A) I want to have LASIK done to my eyes. Has the FDA approved this procedure?           (Direct consumer to the LASIK website, www.fda.gov/cdrh/lasik)

B) I’m thinking of having breast implants – which type is the safest?  (Direct to the Breast Implant web site) www.fda.gov/cdrh/breastimplants

E) I want to sell my used device on eBay – how do I accomplish that? (Direct to the eBay/online sales web site) The entire consumer topic list is available from the CDRH Consumer Information page, www.fda.gov/cdrh/consumer.

F) Are X-rays and CT scans safe?  (Direct to the radiological health web site)

G) I need information about a recent recall?  (Direct to the ORA recall site)

H) How do I report to the FDA a problem or adverse event I experienced with a device?   (Direct to the MDR Medwatch page)

I) How do I know if devices made in China (or any other foreign country) are safe and effective?   (Direct to various press releases or Q&A on this subject)

J) My insurance company will not pay for a certain procedure – can FDA help me?          (Direct to appropriate consumer web site)

K)  What is the status of a device undergoing clinical trials? Can I be part of a clinical study?   (Direct to the Clinical Trials web site)

L)  Does FDA approve off label use for a device cleared for another indication?  (Direct to appropriate consumer link)

M)  My husband’s pacemaker has been recalled – what should we do?    (Direct to appropriate press release)

 N )  I need a list of all approved hernia meshes.   (Direct to the 510k, PMA or classification databases depending on product code). 

O) How does FDA approve a medical device?   (Direct to Device Advice . A great on-line tool we have developed is Device Advice, www.fda.gov/cdrh/devadvice. It walks one through the decision process)
