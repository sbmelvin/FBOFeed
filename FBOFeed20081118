<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT to Award a Sole Source Procurement. The Government intends to issue a sole source contract for the privatization of the water distribution and wastewater collection systems for the Pennsylvania Air National Guard Base (ANGB) located at Pittsburgh International Airport (IAP), to Moon Township Municipal Authority. Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. Moon Township Municipal Authority (Contractor) will assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems and will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government. The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system. The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area. The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract. The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract. The electric system being privatized is described as follows: The Pennsylvania Air National Guard 171st Air Refueling Wing (ARW) is located at the Pittsburgh International Airport, approximately 16 miles northwest of downtown Pittsburgh in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. The 171st ARW base employs full-time personnel during regular weekday shifts and Traditional guardsmen that are on the installation during their respective Unit Training Assembly (UTA) weekends. The UTA weekend occurs one weekend each month for each unit. The 171st ARW occupies 176 acres leased from the Allegheny County Department of Aviation. The 171st maintains a mixture of mostly industrial and some administrative buildings. Major additions or deletions to the installation are not planned at this time. The Pennsylvania ANG (171st ARW) has two separate water supply lines. The main water supply is provided by Moon Township Municipal Authority (MTMA). The backup water supply is provided by Findlay Township. Water from the MTMA is supplied to the 171st ARW through a 10 inch diameter ductile iron supply line that starts near the entrance of the 911th (Airlift Wing) AW and passes beneath the main airport runway. The 10 inch line begins in a valve and meter vault located on the 911th Airlift Wing (AW) property. The 171st assumes ownership of the line on the downstream side of the master meter. The 171st main supply line runs from the vault to the south on 911th property before entering the Pittsburgh International Airport (Pittsburgh IAP) property where it passes under runway 32-14 before entering the 171st property. The Findlay Township backup water supply enters the 171st ARW below ground near the main gate from McClaren Road. The line passes through the Findlay Township master meter and backflow preventer located in the metering pit. The 171st ARW's distribution system is made up of a combination of several loops and long dead-end branches. The system's dead ends do not appear to create excess maintenance, sediment, or brown water problems. Water lines are comprised of 2 to 10 inch diameter ductile iron, cast iron, plastic, and asbestos cement pipes which are located at a range of 3 to 20 feet below ground, although the actual depth of pipe may exceed this range. The average pressure supplied to the Base is 90 psig. Wastewater generated by the 171st ARW is carried off Base through an 8-inch sewer main in the southeast corner of the Base and through an 8-inch sewer line leaving the Guard Shack. Both lines enter the Moon Township Municipal Authority's (MTMA) sanitary sewer collection system at MTMA owned manholes. The 171st ARW wastewater collection system consists primarily of gravity-flow pipe with two lift stations . The collection system consists of laterals, oil/water separators, and collector mains. The oil/water separators remove industrial wastes from the water before it enters the sanitary sewer system, but are not part of this contract. Service laterals are typically 4 to 6-inches in diameter, and mains range from 6 to 8-inches in diameter. The depth of cover over wastewater collection pipes generally varies from 4 to 10 feet. Although, the actual depth may vary. Most of the system consists of the original vitrified clay pipe installed in the 1960s. The Base has two medium size lift stations. The first lift station was constructed in 1996. This lift station is operated when there is an AFFF fire suppression dump and during system tests. The second lift station moves wastewater from buildings at the southeast corner of the base to an Air Force owned manhole which drains by gravity. The pumps and controls for the second lift station were replaced in 2003. Competitive proposals were requested in 2003 and no offers were received. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of DoD Utility Privatization Policy dated 2002. However, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This information shall include: confirmation of your understanding that the requirement includes purchasing the water distribution and wastewater collection systems, and then entering into a 40-year contract for the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the systems; furnish us with references indicating your prior experience operating, maintaining, repairing and replacing such systems; and indicate how you would meet the emergency response time requirement of one hour. All responses received within ten calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

1) Participate in developing a Manual of Procedures.
2) Provide investigators with requested translational study support or cellular therapy products.
3) Work cooperatively with Coordinating Center to implement procedures for evaluating, prioritizing and processing requests for service.
4) Assure prompt accumulation, entry, and editing of product related data in accordance with protocols.
5) Implement and maintain quality control and quality assurance plans for all products.
6) Design and implement monitoring plans for products including production, compliance, with regulatory requirements, and assistance in designing clinical studies.
7) Report adverse events.
8) Process, store, ship and analyze products produced.
9) Participate in yearly site visits conducted by the Coordinating Center.
10) Implement programs or mechanisms to train interested investigators in the conduct of translational research and manufacturing procedures.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) has a requirement for remote area monitor systems for evaluation for potential fielding to the Navy's various radiation facilities.  The system shall consist of a detector, control unit, and two (2) remote indicators.  A carrying case shall be provided with each system.  Currently, there are four gamma remote area monitors in use, the BZ-216, AN/GDR-2A, IM-261 and IM-261A.  These are no longer manufactured and the Navy is pursuing a new remote area monitor system which will replace these four systems, and standardize the Navy's gamma alarms throughout all its radiation facilities.  The production phase of the procurement will have a period of performance of 180 days, over which 250 units will be procured.
The set-aside for small business concerns has been dissolved.  The NAICS code is 334519.  NSWCCD intends to negotiate a competitive procurement using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5 - Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, and award a firm fixed price purchase order.  The system is expected to be a commercial off-the-shelf item which has been modified to meet the requirements in the RFQ.  The RFQ will be issued and posted on FedBizOpps on or about 03 December 2008.

NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (Apr 1999)
(a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the fleet.
(b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier's past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of the Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs).  
(c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance - Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999), will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government.  

ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE-NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999)
(a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the Fleet.(b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government. The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier's quote having a red or yellow classification for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved; suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers who past performance data in the RYG data for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price related factors (e.g., transportation charges, f! irst article testing, and discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier's FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revised performance data becomes available.  (d)  RYG classifications are summarized as follows:	(1)  Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed.	(2)  Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assuring actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs.	(3)  Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs.	(4)  Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.(e)  RYG classifications for all applicable FSC(s) are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NSLC) Portsmouth Detachment, Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth NH  03801-3884, telephone number 603-431-9460, ext 464, FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, a written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NSLC at the above address.  The request must include the requester's name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity  (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NSLC will provide each supplier, at no charge, an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing their individual data.

The additional documentation can be a birth certificate, passport or other official military documentation of United States citizenship.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />This is a Sources Sought notice with the intent to award a sole source contract to General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems (GDAIS) under the authority of FAR 6.302 because DGAIS is the original developer of the software product described in this notice and is uniquely qualified to perform the tasks described below. Notice is provided as information to the marketplace, market research, and is an invitation for any other qualified companies to express their interest in and demonstrate their capability to perform the anticipated work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span><br />Pursuant to contract number NTSB-C-04-0009, GDAIS developed and implemented the first generation of the National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB's) Crash Investigation Data Extraction and Readout (CIDER) software application. CIDER is used to read and analyze information from all types of Flight Data Recorders (FDRs). CIDER is a Java application that currently consists of approximately several million lines of source code developed by GDAIS, who has a unique familiarity with the CIDER system and maintenance of it. CIDER has been fully commented using Java Docs. Contract NTSB-C-04-0009 was completed on January 31, 2007, and the NTSB received and accepted all deliverables. The NTSB has begun rolling out CIDER in a full operational mode, but requires continuing CIDER support and maintenance. Additionally, the NTSB anticipates further related software development requirements to extend CIDER's functionality, perhaps including the addition of railroad event recorder readout and analysis capabilities. As a result, the NTSB has identified the following three (3) Task Areas for support:<br />1. Task Area 1 - System Maintenance<br />2. Task Area 2 - New Features and Functionality<br />3. Task Area 3 - System Enhancements and Improvement</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To fulfill its CIDER requirements during Fiscal Year (FY) 2009, the NTSB anticipates issuing Delivery Orders on a sole-source basis to GDAIS under General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contract GS-10F-0237L issued under FSS 874, titled "Mission Oriented Business Integrated Services" (MOBIS). This requirement falls within North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 541511 - Custom Computer Programming Services. Because the NTSB's CIDER requirement will extend into FY2010 and beyond, this Notice is being published to permit qualified companies to express their interest in and demonstration their capability to perform the anticipated work during FY2010 and beyond.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Required Capabilities<br /></span>CIDER was developed with Java, Microsoft SQL, WebDav and JavaViews software products; consequently, the NTSB requires a contractor-provided team of Java Developers to accomplish the three (3) Task Areas of support described above. A contractor capable of providing such a team must also demonstrate prior past performance developing and delivering similar top-quality software for use in an engineering or scientific environment. Further, a contractor must be able to satisfy the Government, preferable through past performance, that it is capable of developing the intimate knowledge and expertise required for it to successfully and efficiently assume software maintenance and development responsibilities for a software package that it did not develop. Finally, the NTSB requires a Contractor with an extensive understanding of FDRs, how data are stored, extracted, and converted from FDRs to engineering units, and the engineering graphics, animation, and analyses that aviation accident investigators require of FDR data. In addition to FDR capabilities, because the NTSB contemplates adding railroad event recorder readout and analysis capability to CIDER, expertise with such recorders or the engineering analysis of the data recovered from surface vehicle recording systems would also be desirable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />Sources capable of fully satisfying the above requirements are invited to submit capability statements/expressions of interest providing the Government the necessary information to determine actual capability. At a minimum, this information, which must be prepared specifically in response to this notice should, must include: (1) identification of company or organization; (2) an assertion of existing, full capability to meet proposed requirements; (3) business/contracts/marketing office point(s) of contact; (4) notification of business size and /or special status; and (5) any additional information that may be useful to the successful procurement of the requirements, if solicited. These expressions of interest shall adhere to a ten (10)-page submission limit plus web links and any specialized product descriptions. The statement of qualifications should include only information that clearly demonstrates the respondent's capabilities, expertise, and experience to perform the requirements described in this notice. General marketing material should not be included. The NTSB prefers that companies do not submit proprietary material. However, the Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of your submittal. If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, which shall be considered by NTSB. Parties must submit information within fifteen days of publication of this notice. NTSB will not return capability statements and the supporting documentation submitted in response to this notice. Telephone responses and inquiries will not be accepted. You may email questions regarding this notice to the issuing office to Bryan Moy via email at: bryan.moy@ntsb.gov.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)Instruments for U.S. ILN Lunar MissionsLunar Science Program, Science Mission Directorate, NASAFollowing the signing of the International Network Statement of Intent on July 24, 2008,NASA is seeking information regarding potential instruments to be flown on the U.S. nodesthat will be a part of the International Lunar Network (ILN). As part of the preparationfor the ILN discussions, and in order to provide an initial basis for discussions withthe international community, NASA chartered an U.S. ILN Science Definition Team (SDT) toprovide analysis of potential high valued science objectives that could be realized witha lunar network. Based on the recommendations of the U.S. ILN SDT, NASA is soliciting information throughthis Request for Information (RFI) on the following types of instruments being consideredfor the ILN: seismometers, heat flow probes, electromagnetic probes, and laser ranginginstrumentation. However, as the Core Instruments Working Group (CIWG) of theinternational ILN is still identifying a core instrument set, other available lightweightinstrument types that could both provide complimentary data and make use of the uniquecapabilities of a lunar network will also be considered; information on such instrumentsis also solicited by this RFI. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), the information requested is for planning purposes onlyand is not intended to bind the Government. This information will be used to informNASAs program planning, including consideration of how to solicit instruments for theU.S. nodes of the ILN mission.BackgroundNASA has initiated multiple new lunar missions based on the Presidents Fiscal Year 2009budget request including both orbiters and landers. These missions are robotic lunarscience missions within the overall envelope of the U.S. Space Exploration Policy. ThisRFI is directed to one of these missions, a lunar lander network, the ILN, which willaddress elements of the 2007 National Research Council (NRC) Report, Scientific Contextfor the Exploration of the Moon, hereafter SCEM, in particular, objectives 2a and 2b onthe lunar interior. ILN is a strategic mission that will address these goals to theextent possible within the limitations imposed by mass, cost, and duration of theproposed mission. The main objective of the U.S. nodes of the ILN is to understand the interior structureand composition of the Moon, including:	Determining the size, composition, and state (solid/liquid) of the core of theMoon;	Characterizing the thermal state of the interior and elucidate the workings ofthe planetary heat engine;	Characterizing the chemical/physical stratification in the mantle, particularlythe nature of the putative 500-km discontinuity and the composition of the lower mantle;and	Determining the thickness of the lunar crust (upper and lower) and characterizingits lateral variability on regional and global scales.However, the core instrument set of the International Lunar Network has not beenfinalized, and other science objectives, enabled by the final core instrument suiterecommended by the ILN CIWG, may ultimately be considered.Description of Anticipated Requirement NASA expects to emplace the first two nodes (the anchor nodes) of the ILN in the2012-2014 timeframe with two additional nodes to be emplaced roughly two years later,depending on funds availability. All nodes will carry identical core instrument payloads.The ILN mission requires long lived instruments which can be operated as a network forsix years (the anchor nodes will necessarily have to last longer). It is anticipated thata very small amount of power will be available to enable continuous operation through thelunar night. Concept studies for the spacecraft are now under development at NASAs Marshall SpaceFlight Center working with the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) of The Johns HopkinsUniversity. The mission will be tightly constrained in both mass and power. It isexpected that the total available mass for all payload instruments will be approximately15 kg, although the precise mass available for the payload will depend on the launchvehicle and other trades still being considered. The total available payload power willbe approximately 15 W.The total budget for the ILN anchor nodes including development and operations is $200M.Schedule and budget constraints require that NASA mission planners focus on relativelymature instruments. The NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) has issued this RFI to survey the communityfor instruments (or instrument packages) that can potentially provide data sets relevantto the science objectives of the ILN mission. We are very interested in relatively mature(TRL level 4 or higher) instruments. The current focus is on seismometers, heat flowprobes, electromagnetic probes, and laser ranging instrumentation, but other kinds ofinstruments are of interest if a case can be made that these instruments wouldsubstantially address one or more of the goals of the ILN mission, would make use of theunique capabilities of a lunar network, and can be accommodated within the tightmass/power/cost constrains of the mission. The RFI is not limited to single instruments,information on instrumentation packages of more than one instrument is requested as well.NASAs current plans are to use the information from this RFI in part to inform thedevelopment of an instrument procurement approach which is expected to be through anAnnouncement of Opportunity.Responses from all interested parties, including non-U.S. organizations, are solicited.Recognizing that any collaboration between NASA and a non-U.S. organization must beconsistent with NASA's no-exchange-of-funds policy where each nation is responsible forits own activities, any non-U.S. response should identify the source of funding anddiscuss the status of funding commitments. It is not NASAs intent to publicly disclose proprietary information obtained throughthis RFI. To the full extent that it is protected pursuant to the Freedom of InformationAct and other laws and regulations, information identified by a respondent asProprietary or Confidential will be kept confidential. Personnel from APL may beinvolved in activities related to this RFI. However any APL personnel with access toinformation provided to NASA in response to this RFI will be required to sign and toabide by a Nondisclosure Agreement.This RFI is for planning and information purposes only and is not to be construed as acommitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will theGovernment pay for information solicited. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If asolicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOps and on the NASA AcquisitionInternet Service. Requested InformationThe response to this RFI will be in the form of a PDF document that is uploaded throughNASAs NSPIRES system (see instructions below). The response should not exceed ten pagesin length.The response must contain the following information:	Name of submitter and contact information (institutional affiliation, phonenumber, email address);	Capabilities and qualifications statement that addresses the submitters abilityto provide an instrument (or instrument package) that falls within one or more of thefive categories listed above (seismometer, heat flow probe, electromagnetic probe, laserranging instrumentation, or an instrument that uses an alternative technology thataddresses one of the ILN objectives given in the background information above). In thelatter case (an alternative instrument technology), a concise and compelling case thatthe data obtained will adequately address one or more ILN objectives is required;	A description of instrument (or instrument package) mass, volume, powerrequirement, data rate, and deployment requirements;	A description of what the instrument (or instrument package) measures, themeasurement approach, and the ability of those measurements to address one or more of theobjectives of the ILN mission;	A description of payload accommodation requirements;	A description of the instrument flight heritage;	A description of the anticipated cost and schedule for instrument (or instrumentpackage) delivery; and 	A discussion of respondents past experience delivering similar instruments toNASA or other space flight missions;InstructionsAll responses submitted in response to this RFI must be submitted in electronic form viaNSPIRES, the NASA online announcement data management system, located athttp://nspires.nasaprs.com/    .

Presently, there are nearly twice as many overweight children and almost three times as many overweight adolescents as there were in 1980, according to CDC.  A significant concern from a public health perspective is that overweight children may grow up to become overweight or obese adults, placing them at greater risk for major health problems such as heart disease and diabetes.  Much work remains to meet the Healthy People 2010/2020 nutrition and physical activity targets.  Preventing obesity is a major HHS initiative.  The Blueprint was developed collaboratively by HRSA, CDC, NIH and the Association of State and Territorial Nutrition Directors (ASTPHND) to improve the health of the nation by integrating sound policy, programs, resources, services, and messages where individuals, children and families make choices about eating and physical activity.  

Over the past three years, ASTPHND has been working with HRSAs MCHB to disseminate the Blueprint through State and local agency implementation.  As part of their plan they have provided technical assistance to State Nutrition Directors as well as provided seed grant funding to five states.

Specifically, the contractor will assist the State and Territorial Nutrition Directors in the following areas:
1.  Implementing the National Blueprint for Nutrition and Physical Activity at the state and local levels by continuing to develop individual state/local healthy eating, obesity prevention and physical activity plans with a focus on the maternal and child health population.
2.  Developing three regional leadership technical assistance networks focused on the State and Territorial Nutrition Directors and HRSA Nutrition Training Grants. 

The Contractor will be required to produce the following deliverables:
1.  State and/or local Blueprint implementation plans for a minimum of five sites per year.
2.  Technical assistance to states, local communities and HRSA nutrition training grants, including telephone and in-person consultation as needed.
3.  Hold yearly program meeting.
4.  Quarterly progress reports containing information on services provided under the contract.

Qualified contractors must satisfy the following minimum requirements.  Provide a detailed description of your companys experience and demonstrated abilities to deliver each and every one (address each one separately) of the following requirements:
1.  Demonstrated familiarity and knowledge of the National Blueprint for Nutrition and Physical Activity, including the implementation of work done in the past three years.
2.  Access to an established network for efficiently engaging State Nutrition Directors.
3.  Experience in the field of public health nutrition, physical activity, and nutrition leadership training programs.
4.  Awareness of cultural diversity and its effect on nutrition and physical activity programs.
5.  Demonstrated ability to work with State Nutrition Directors and HRSAs Nutrition Training Directors and to conduct meetings.

In addition, it is preferable that the Contractor has experience working with federal contracts meeting deadlines while maintaining flexibility in the work process.    

A cost reimbursement type contract is anticipated for a total of 3 years.  This is a follow-on requirement.  The NAICS Code is 541690, with a small business size standard of $7.0 m.

Interested small business potential offerors are encouraged to respond to this notice.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Natick Soldier RD&E Center (NSRDEC), in support of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Directorate for Science and Technology (S&T), is seeking information on available products and prototypes designed to allow indoor tracking of individual emergency responders via devices worn by the individual, displaying the position and tracking information on a command console outside the monitored area and operating without benefit of pre-installed infrastructure, without the presence of indoor equipment beyond that worn by the individual being tracked, and without a prior indoor site survey. The primary interest is in systems that work without the need for additional indoor equipment (so called bread crumb devices) but consideration will also be given to systems that require this. Information received from this RFI will be used to identify potential participants in a multi-day personnel locator demonstration and operational assessment to be conducted in approximately the Feb-Apr 09 timeframe in the greater Boston, MA area. Participants in this evaluation will, through the demonstration of available capabilities, provide input into DHS S&T testing and evaluation for precision location systems for emergency responders and law enforcement personnel.<BR><BR>Candidate systems shall provide 3-D position information for multiple emergency responders updated at least every 15 seconds, relative to some fixed point with accuracy of 3 meters or better in an indoor environment and ability to identify floor level using prototype or production system components that are suitable for use in a simulated operational environment. The target user group for these devices is the emergency responder community, including, but not limited to firefighters and law enforcement officers, and all submissions should be suited to their concepts of operation.  Systems may make use of support devices placed outside a building if the use of such devices does not cause extended delays in the current emergency responder concept of operations. Likewise, the size, weight, and location of the device worn by the individual being tracked should not encumber their movements or ability to adhere to ordinary operational procedures. This RFI is primarily interested in indoor performance; however, if supported in addition to indoor operation, performance in an outdoor environment is also of interest. <BR><BR>During the planned demonstration and assessment, invited participant systems will be evaluated in a variety of building types by emergency responders in realistic responder generated scenarios. Invited participating system developers and evaluators from the first responder community and DHS will have an opportunity to review and comment on the demonstration plan prior to execution. Participant system developers will be responsible for providing system training to the emergency responders involved in the execution of the demonstration. During the demonstration, operation of the system will be limited to the trained emergency responders with limited interaction with system developers. The demonstration and assessment will be closed-door, that is, only the participant, Government representatives, and the Government identified evaluation team (including emergency responder representatives and observers) will be present during demonstration and assessment of each participants system. A public summary report on the overall technological status of precision location systems and the implications of the tests regarding current maturity of such systems will be published but individual systems or the participant entity that submitted them for testing will not be identified with any particular record of performance.  Participants will receive responder feedback and performance data for their own system. <BR><BR>**Responses to this RFI shall be formatted in accordance with the RFI template file which can be obtained by contacting the technical project officer via email (Mr. Scott Ullery  scott.g.ullery@us.army.mil). A document providing limited supplemental information on the test concept under development will also be provided when requesting the RFI template. **<BR><BR>Responses to this RFI must not exceed 10 pages and should address the requests below as well as include a completed requirements and maturity metric table (as provided in the RFI template file available from the technical project officer). Specific information sought includes: (1) A brief description (200 words or less) of the product or prototype system.

<CONTACT>Stephen E. Lee, Contract Specialist, Phone 7039072855, Fax 703-907-1244, Email stephen.lee2@dia.mil
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) on Industry Standards for Unattended Ground Sensors (UGS) 

1.  INTRODUCTION

It is the intent of the Virginia Contracting Activity (VACA) to obtain Industry technical information pertaining to STANDARDS in communications, protocols, command sets, payload formats, and hardware interfaces etc. for Unattended Ground Sensors (UGS).  

2. PURPOSE

To identify standards, technologies and sources that are considered best qualified to meet current and future requirements.  The government will be evaluating UGS interfaces and standards for future efforts and seeks to identify interested parties and technologies.  The goal is to understand current interfaces in sufficient detail and address systems interoperability.

3.  BACKGROUND

VACA recognizes the need for a common system architecture for DoD UGS due to lack of seamless interoperability of current UGS systems and components.  Many UGS systems are encumbered with either proprietary design architecture or incompatibility of components.  We are requesting information to assess current state of the industry common communications and architectures.  Furthermore, this information will be utilized by the government to determine a path forward and define common standards for future UGS systems.  To establish common standards will enable the services to employ UGS that are interoperable and provide increased operational effectiveness and utility. 

4.  Information Required

This RFI is seeks information from UGS integrators/suppliers and sensor manufacturers pertaining to their current UGS systems.  Provide information to include techncial descpritions of physical and logical interfaces: e.g. command sets, input/output protocols, payload formats, etc.  Provide company capabilities on current interface standards as well as future plans to establish future systems standards. 

It is requested that interested sources respond with a capability synopsis broken into the following sections:


(1) Describe the specific intent and/or use of their legacy, current production and future UGS. 

(2) Describe how their products interact and communicate with their various components. For example: How does a sensor send its signal to the main system component so it can trigger the camera? Specifically:

(a)	How is the data physically transmitted from one component to another?  Is the data transferred by hard wired connections; e.g. analog radio frequency (RF), digital RF, IEEE 802.11/15, satellite communications, cell phone communications, etc.  Be specific; include data transmission protocol, rates, range (line of site or over the horizon), encryption and frequencies.

(b)	When communicating from one component to another; what type of data signal is sent?

(c)	What format does the signal transmission follow when it is sent?

(d)	Does the data signal follow an industry standard format? If so, what standard does it follow? If not an industry standard format, could the data signal be modified to support an industry standard? Any proprietary hardware/software and/or data encoding should be identified.

(e)	What systems are your UGS currently compatible with? 

(f)	What systems are your future UGS planned to be compatible with? 

(g)	Are their any limiting factors on data transmission such as bandwidth, refresh rate, etc.? 

(h)	What future standards would you propose for DoD UGS that would allow for interoperability similar to that of the goal of the community support for SIEWG standard?  



6.  SUBMITTAL INSTRUCTIONS

a.  All capability statements submitted in response to this RFI are to be received no later than 1400 Eastern Standard Time (EST) on 03 December 2008 in a word doc format.  To aid the Government review, submissions should be no more than 50 pages.  Company brochures, information sheets, and similar types of published information may be provided if cross referenced in the RFI response.  Telephonic requests or responses will not be accepted.  The RFI is for market research only.  No additional information is available at this time.

b.   This notice is for information and planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to any contractual agreement.  This is not a request for proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a contract based on responses under this announcement nor otherwise pay for preparing any information sent for the Government use.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  Responders must provide the following: 1) company name and address; 2) point of contact; 3) phone/fax/email; 4) NAICS Codes, 5) business size and status, type of small business if applicable (e.g. 8(a), women-owned, HUB Zone Small Business, etc.) and 6) capability information in response to the requirement.

c. 	Provide electronic response to Contracts Specialist is Mr. Stephen Lee, 703-907-2855; Stephen.lee2@dia.mil.

8.  QUESTIONS

All general, contractual, and technical questions are to be submitted through the contracts specialist.  The Government will endeavor to respond to all questions submitted.

<DESC><p>In October 2008, AMS met with the National Chicken Council (NCC) to discuss support of the broiler industry through a bonus buy (surplus removal) of various broiler products to be distributed to USDA food assistance program recipients. NCC approached AMS because of their concern with the enormous financial losses the broiler industry is currently experiencing. Currently, broiler companies are experiencing major financial losses due to negative margins as a result of increased cost of production. A bonus buy (surplus removal) of broilers (chicken) and broiler products will provide a much-needed source of high-quality protein to recipients of Federal food assistance programs, will provide immediate direct market support to the U.S. domestic broiler industry, and will assist in alleviating depressed market conditions for this industry.</p>
<p>All potential offerors All potential offerors are advised that this solicitation includes the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause at 48 C.F.R. 52.212-4 (Feb 2007) for Commercial Items. This clause requires all contractors doing business with the Federal Government to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. Offerors should include their Data Universal Number System (DUNS) number in their offers. The Contracting Officer will verify registration in the CCR database prior to award by entering the potential awardees' DUNS number into the CCR database. As of January 1, 2005, all potential offerors are required to complete the annual representations and certifications electronically via the On-line Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), which should be completed at http://orca.bpn.gov. This information is included in this solicitation in the provision FAR 52.212-1 (Jun 2008) Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items. Failure to complete either of these registration procedures outlined in this solicitation may result in elimination from consideration for award.</p>
<p>Proposals shall be received on or before the deadline of December 8, 2008, 1:00 pm, Eastern Standard Time, via fax to (202) 720-5871, or e-mail to the Contract Specialist, Valerie Dinkel at <a href="mailto:Valerie.Dinkel@usda.gov">Valerie.Dinkel@usda.gov</a>.&nbsp; Award will be made by January 7, 2009.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Point of contact is Anthony Williams, Contract Specialist at 703-696-1657 or anthony.williams@whs.mil

Justification - This acquisition is conducted under the authority of Section 201 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 501), Services for Executive Agencies, as implemented at FAR 8.405-6(b).

1. Contracting Agency - The contracting activity for this acquisition is the Washington Headquarters Services Acquisition and Procurement Office (A&PO). 

2. Description of Action - This acquisition is for renewal of the annual maintenance support of the Xacta IA Manager for the Washington Headquarters Services Information Assurance Division (IAD). The Period of Performance (PoP) for this acquisition shall be from 1 December 2008 and 30 November 2009. 

3. Description of Supplies  The IA Manager will provide centralized automated processing and tracking of System Security Authorization Agreements throughout WHS including: security analysis, checklist-based security requirements which populate the Security Requirements Traceability Matrix (SRTM), generated Formal Test Plan, automated and streamlined documentation for the certification/accreditation requirements to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements for the WHS-wide Enterprise.  The automated program will enforce processes for compliance with FISMA, DITSCAP-DIACAP and other Federal requirements.  IA Manager collects extensive IT asset inventory data and detects, identifies, and remediates threats to system security.  Provides continuous assessments of the Enterprise security posture and automated security policies and will enforce procedures.  IA Manager generates reports and documentation needed for regulatory compliance and ongoing operations of the WHS IT Enterprise. 

4. Justification - The items requested herein are particular to only one manufacturer Xacta IA Manager annual maintenance license renewal serves as an important tool for the WHS system develops and the security team to develop and maintain C&A documentation. Without the tool, WHS would be required revert back to the manual process to manage system documentation required for accreditation. This would cause an increased workload and reduce the productivity of application system developers, system function owners, and security documenter.  In addition, failure to renew the software license would result in an increase of manpower and resources required to document and manage the DOD mandated program.  Without the documentation WHS will be unable to Certify and Accredit the network, enclaves, and application systems required to run the day to day business of the organization.

The objective of this program is to be able to reduce TDY to school costs while providing the training to our Airmen anytime, anywhere. This supports the AFSO 21 program and is in line with both AFSO 21 and AETC goals.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The anticipated Solicitation release date is on or about 24 November 2008. The solicitation will be a competitive 8(a) set-aside that will result in up to four indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract awards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All anticipated task orders for converting classes will be placed by 30 September 2009, with final deliveries and acceptance of converted classes occurring NLT 30 September 2010.</p>

<p>Classification Code: R - Professional, Administrative, and Management Support Services</p>
<p>NAICS code: 541 -- Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services/541511 - Custom Computer Programming Services</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Rome has a requirement to provide life cycle software development engineering to the Department of Defense Intelligence Information System (DoDIIS) and the US Intelligence Community worldwide. An indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity cost-plus-fixed-fee (completion) type contract is contemplated with an ordering period of 36 months. We anticipate $49,900,000 to be a sufficient ordering amount for the 36 month period of performance. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541511.</p>
<p>The scope of this effort is to provide life cycle software development engineering DODIIS and the Intelligence Community missions worldwide. The approach is to provide studies, analyses, designs, development, recommendations, enhancements, integration management, configuration management, testing and evaluation of existing and new systems, and their transition into the operational environment, and system and network administration/operation. Technical activities will include, but not be limited to: Development, prototyping, and implementation of operational software to increase capability of the system to perform its mission, to add new capability or to remove an existing capability. Include performing analytical studies, feasibility/impact studies, system analyses, system design, development, system trade-off studies, experimental design efforts, experimental/prototype hardware and software demonstration efforts, architecture analyses, system requirements analyses, system design studies, software requirements analyses, software design, software development efforts, system specification and planning, system integration, configuration management, security activities, advanced system developments, rapid prototyping, test and evaluation, suitability testing of developmental systems in order to improve systems capability to perform their mission. In the course of performance, the Contractor will interface with various agencies at various DODIIS and U.S. Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Community sites worldwide via on-site performance, short term visits and electronic means in the Washington DC area, Hampton VA, and U.S. Intelligence Community sites worldwide including Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Bosnia, and Cuba and other hazardous locations. On-site support is currently required in Germany, Colorado Springs, CO, San Antonio TX, the Washington DC area (MD, VA, and DC), Boston MA, and AFRL Rome Research Site to provide technical expertise in the analysis, design, development, integration, testing, and evaluation of DODIIS Information Technology (IT) and to U.S. C4ISR Community systems and activities.</p>
<p>Evaluation of the small business capability packages received in response to the previous Sources Sought announcement resulted in a determination that a small business set-aside was not warranted.</p>
<p>Foreign participation is excluded at the prime contractor level, unless authorized through a current approved National Interest Determination (NID). All information generated or maintained under this effort is export controlled. Therefore, prospective offerors must provide a completed and approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, which certifies the offeror is on the Certified Contractors Access List (CCAL) or the offeror is seeking application to CCAL. For further information on CCAL, contact the Defense Logistics Information Service at 1-877-352-2255 or on the web at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/. It is solely the responsibility of the contractor to obtain an export license from the U. S. Department of State and to comply with the federal laws and regulations. Questions concerning the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and export licensing must be directed to the U.S. Department of State's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and not the Air Force Project Engineer, Contracting Office, or Air Force Foreign Disclosure Office. Under the current contract, the work requires a SECRET facility clearance and approximately 125 personnel with TOP SECRET / SCI security clearances. Based on current estimates, approximately 17 personnel with Top Secret SCI clearances will be required for performance at time of award. An additional 45 cleared personnel (30 in Rome NY, 5 in the National Capital Region, and 10 in the Langley VA) is estimated to be required within the first 60 days. It is estimated that a total of 97 cleared Top Secret/SCI personnel will be required during the first six months of contract performance.</p>
<p>A technical library relating to the subject area of this acquisition is available for review by potential offerors at the Air Force Research Laboratory/RIEB, Building 3, 525 Brooks Road, Rome New York 13441-4505. The library contains technical data subject to export control. Appointments for access may be made by submitting a request to the AFRL Program Manager, at least four business days in advance. Prior to access being granted, potential offerors must submit a copy of an approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, along with a letter from the Data Custodian designated on that form, authorizing access by whomever will be reviewing the library. Address the request to: ATTN: Christopher Stepanick, Air Force Research Laboratory/RIEB, 525 Brooks Road, Rome, New York 13441-4505, or via fax to 315-330-3913.</p>
<p>In accordance with AFFARS 5301.91, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. Before consulting with an Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the Contracting Officer, Lori Anguilli, (315) 330-1955, Lori.Anguilli@rl.af.mil, for resolution. AFFARS Clause 5352.201-9101 Ombudsman (AUG 2005) will be incorporated into the resultant contract. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the Ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The Ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. Consulting an Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). If resolution cannot be made by the Contracting Officer, concerned parties may contact the following AFRL Ombudsman: Susan Hunter, Building 15, RM225, 1864 4th Street, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7130 FAX: 937-255-5036 COM: 937-255-7754. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the AFRL level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force Ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067. The Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. Do not contact the Ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contract Specialist.</p>

Congressional legislation as well as Presidential directives have mandated that the proliferation of federally provided radionavigation systems be reduced and that the DoD-provided GPS be promoted as both a national and international standard, dual-use (military and civil) PNT system.  These same mandates also direct the DoD to ensure the protection of GPS for use by US and coalition allies, while preventing adversary use of civil GPS (or like systems) and not unduly impacting peaceful use of civil GPS (or like systems) outside a theater of operations.   In carrying out the congressional and presidential direction, ASD(NII) is responsible for ensuring the DoD addresses  a number of GPS, PNT and Navigation Warfare (Navwar) acquisition, integration, sustainment, and modernization challenges before the full benefits envisioned for GPS and other DoD PNT systems can be realized.  To ensure that the proper expertise and planning are focused on these key GPS and Navwar issues as well as those associated with other DoD PNT/radionavigation systems, the DoD conducts ongoing assessments, analyses, and evaluations supporting the broad scope of program and system oversight activities as well as policy development and planning.<BR>New PWS for brige contracts is as follows.
