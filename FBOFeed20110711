Video two is a top view of the model. We want to display Total Temperature in the lower center of the video screen and Total Pressure next to that. Total Temperature and Total Pressure are changing as we run, therefore the values displayed on the video screen must change accordingly. All three of the parameters will be sent to the overlay system together. The software will be programmed to send to Mach Number to one channel and the Temp and Pressure to another channel. <br /><br /><br />

<DESC>The project is to provide touch up painting on multiple parts of a 100+ year-old steel bridge structure.

Due to the style of the bridge, there are intricate pieces of steel joined together creating multiple faces to be painted in each work area. Item to be painted are not to be disassembled. Lead paint is not anticipated on the bridge.<br>The rough order of magnitude for this proposed procurement is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.

<DESC><strong>Synopsis - NB686040-11-01920</strong>
<p><strong>Supply - Amplified Femtosecond Laser System for X-Ray Generation</strong></p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology Acquisition Management Division intends to solicit a contract using FAR Part 15 - Contracting by Negotiation for an Amplified Femtosecond Laser using full and open competition. Market research was conducted, including a Sources Sought on FBO. The result of this research showed that there is not sufficient competition amongst small businesses to ensure the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the laser system is to be used as a source for generating X-ray radiation as part of a larger program to establish X-ray imaging capabilities. The solicitation will be for a current year production model and not a prototype or one-of-a-kind system. This announcement is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and does not commit the Government to solicit or award a contract now or in the future. No solicitation is available at this time. The purpose of this synopsis is to notify organizations with the requisite qualifications to manufacture the item of the potential requirement.</p>
<p>This is a non-commercial item. The requirement is assigned a NAICS code of 334516, with a small business size standard for such requirements of 500 employees.</p>
<p>All questions can be directed in writing to Christine Rogge at christine.rogge@nist.gov. The Government anticipates a Request for Proposal to be issued on or about June 17, 2011.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Program Support Center on behalf of the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) intends to negotiate and award a contract to the National Association of Councils on Developmental Disabilities (NACDD) on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.<br />&nbsp;
<p>The Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD), located within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is the Federal agency responsible for implementation and administration of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 (DD Act of 2000) (42 U.S.C. 15001, et seq.). The DD Act authorizes the following national grant programs:</p>
<p>&bull; State Councils on Developmental Disabilities; <br />&bull; State Protection and Advocacy Systems for Individuals with Developmental Disabilities' Rights; <br />&bull; National Network of University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities, Education, Research, and Service; and <br />&bull; Projects of National Significance.</p>
<p>ADD is responsible for administering these grant programs.</p>
<p>The purpose of the contract to NACDD would be to continue training and technical assistance to the 55 State Councils on Developmental Disabilities that engage in three primary activities: (1) pursuing systems change (e.g., the way human service agencies do business so that individuals with developmental disabilities and their families have better or expanded services), (2) advocacy (e.g., educating policy makers about unmet needs of individuals with developmental disabilities), and (3) capacity building (e.g., working with state service agencies to provide training and benefits to direct care workers) to promote independence, self-determination, productivity, integration and inclusion of people with developmental disabilities in all facets of community life. The goal of the training and technical assistance under this contract is to improve program performance, statutory compliance, and program outcomes across the national network of State Councils on Developmental Disabilities.</p>
<p>The training and technical assistance provided under this contract covers a wide array of activities, including training, consultation, information exchange and dissemination, promotion of best practices, and capacity building.</p>
<p>NACDD is the national membership organization for the State Councils on Developmental Disabilities. It is a 501(c) non-profit organization that promotes and supports the network of State Councils on Developmental Disabilities.</p>
<p>As a membership organization, NACDD serves as a clearinghouse for the national network of State Councils on Developmental Disabilities and provides cohesiveness across the 55 Councils. The 55 State Councils on Developmental Disabilities view NACDD as a trusted source and resource for developing cutting edge, state of the art approaches to systems change, advocacy, and capacity building.</p>
<p>For training and technical assistance to be relevant to the State Councils on Developmental Disabilities, it is necessary to have an entity with the in depth knowledge and understanding of the operations and needs of the Councils. Since NACDD is the membership organization for the State Councils on Developmental Disabilities, it has the unique insight and experience necessary for providing technical assistance to this national network. The 55 Councils view NACDD as their hub for training and technical assistance thereby making NACDD distinctively qualified to provide such services across the State Councils on Developmental Disabilities network. The 55 Councils have invested time, money, and effort to develop this membership organization, which has created a level of trust the State Councils on Developmental Disabilities can depend on to provide the support needed to achieve the mission of the program. Due to its history and connections to the State Councils on Developmental Disabilities program, NACDD is inimitably positioned to provide training and technical assistance under this contract. There is no other entity with the innate and exclusive ability to provide the appropriate training and technical assistance to the 55 State Councils on Developmental Disabilities across the United States and territories.</p>

Consult the solicitation number VA259-11-RP-0098 which is anticipated to be issued on August 15th, 2011 for further details.

This project must proceed in phases.  The initial phase will entail building the new road and parking lot (if put under contract) while the existing road and parking lot are still in use.  The next phase will build the new addition space and renovate a small portion of existing space.  And the final phase, if put under contract, will renovate the existing Rehab space (i.e. entire "F" wing plus the hand therapy room).

The Selection Committee will also evaluate how the members of the construction team will be selected and the success the team has had in the past in working together to achieve project objectives.  This will include any previous experience the team members have in working together.  

The construction team's proposal should emphasize the team's expertise in: 
Construction in a Medical Center/Research facility while maintaining normal operations of the existing adjacent facility. 
Its capacity to devote time to the project.
The degree to which the contractor has previous project experience with critical team members.

EC-4	Past Performance: 
Provide at least 3 references from clients that the construction team has completed in the last 5 years for similar projects and construction conditions.  Referenced projects should preferably have dealt with the situation where adjacent facilities were required to be protected and all services maintained to keep the remaining building occupants in operation.  

EC-5	Cost:
All teams must include a firm fixed lump sum price for the Project work with sufficient work breakdown structure to assure that the Team understands the types of work involved in the project.  As this acquisition is 100% set-aside for SDVOSBs, all offerors must provide a cost breakdown which indicates the minimum 15% of the total contract amount which the SDVOSB will perform with its own resources, exclusive of subcontractors and suppliers. Construction teams are encouraged to propose any value added items that they can deliver within the budget under a section titled "Value Engineering".  Offeror's are advised that if the technical proposals are essentially equal, award will be made on the basis of lowest cost.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research was established in 1989. Its reauthorizing legislation (42 U.S.C. 299 et seq; "Healthcare Research and Quality Act of 1999") renamed it the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and established it as the lead Federal agency whose mission was to enhance the quality, appropriateness, and effectiveness of health services and access to such services for all Americans. AHRQ's mission is to produce "measurable improvements in health care in America, gauged in terms of improved quality of life and patient outcomes, lives saved, and value gained for what we spend." Under the Healthcare Research and Quality Act of 1999 (S 580), which reauthorized AHRQ, AHRQ's reauthorizing legislation stated that, "The Agency shall promote health care quality improvement by conducting and supporting- (1) research that develops and presents scientific evidence regarding all aspects of health care, including- (2) methods for measuring quality and strategies for improving quality; and (3) initiatives to advance private and public efforts to improve health care quality." (cite http://www.ahrq.gov/hrqa99a.htm)</p>
<p>In 2010, AHRQ introduced MONAHRQ, a free desktop software tool that helps organizations quickly and easily turn healthcare data into a customizable, fully-functional reporting website. Designing and building an effective reporting site can be challenging, expensive, and time consuming. MONAHRQ makes this process easier, thus helping to encourage local healthcare quality measurement and reporting in support of Agency efforts such as greater transparency, comparative reporting, quality improvement, and payment initiatives.</p>
<p>The MONAHRQ desktop application allows users to load local healthcare data or information, select data analysis and website customization options, process the data, and generate a full set of website files onto the local computer. Users must host the generated website themselves. A MONAHRQ-generated website can provide information on hospital quality, hospital utilization, potentially avoidable hospital stays, and county rates of hospital use. It targets a variety of audiences such as consumers, providers, and policy makers. It is designed to be easy to use and to follow best practices in public reporting. In the future, AHRQ intends to expand the MONAHRQ tool in ways that include:<br />-- Reporting more types of measures.<br />-- Supporting more reporting features.<br />-- Offering more customization options.<br />-- Increasing ease of use.<br />-- Incorporating additional best practices in reporting, including knowledge generated through AHRQ's new initiative on Building the Science of Public Reporting.</p>

<DESC>PURPOSE: This is a Sources Sought Synopsis; there is no solicitation available at this time. Requests for solicitation will receive no response. This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only. This Sources Sought Synopsis is conducted to identify potential sources capable of meeting the requirements described below and in the attached DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS) and Contract Data Requirements Lists (CDRLs).
<p>NAICS CODE: 541512</p>
<p>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE OF REQUIREMENT: Enterprise Data Collection Layer (EDCL) solutions provide the critical services-oriented architecture (SOA) layer that resides between the data collection devices at the point of supply chain events and the back-end automated information systems (AISs) and enterprise data repositories. EDCL leverages the GCSS-AF architecture and existing capabilities to accomplish this service. EDCL components manage the business rules and communications between ADC devices, networked systems, data, and processes, enabling real-time information and event management.<br />Under previous contract, the Air Force assessed the concept of EDCL, formulated a strategy for its implementation in the Air Force, and acquired, assembled and tested the components within the GCSS-AF Capability Integration Environment (CIE). The scope included the development of Use Cases, evaluation of many EDC vendors, and design implementation, and testing of the recommended solution. The previous effort culminated in a proof of concept demonstration of the feasibility of EDCL. <br />The contractor shall provide all management, labor, tools, equipment, transportation, materials, and parts necessary to support and enhance the Enterprise Data Collection Layer (EDCL) as identified in this Performance Work Statement and supporting contract. <br />Overall objectives for this effort include integration of selected vendor commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) product within the GCSS-AF framework and platform; documentation of the design, services provided, and training materials for EDCL; management of the configuration, implementation, and modification of EDCL components; and provide integration support for migration of common services and existing and future AIT applications.<br />The Contractor shall conduct all activities in compliance with the intent of ISO/IEC 12207 and DoD 5000.2-R. User acceptance will play a key role in the system's success. During the initial implementation migration processes, the Contractor shall schedule time during meetings to allow users to become familiarized with the technology and provide valuable feedback. This will ease the transition to the future work environment.<br />Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB), 8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business small business (HUBZone). All prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be awarded a DoD contract. Prospective contractors are cautioned to ensure that the proper NAICS code appears in their CCR.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR CAPABILITY PACKAGE: All interested parties shall submit a capabilities package in order to document your firm's capability to perform the tasks set forth in the attached DRAFT PWS. Interested contractors shall review, fill-in and return the attached Capabilities Matrix and may also submit a 6-8 page capabilities document. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. Recent, relevant experience in all areas should be provided, including whether this experience was as a prime or subprime contractor, whether it was in support of a Government or commercial contract and what the scope of the experience was. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p><br />DATE DUE: Your capability package may be electronically mailed. All submissions should include the following: Company Name; Address; Point of Contact; Telephone number; E-Mail Address; CAGE Code; Web Page URL; and business size. Responses must be submitted to Denise A. Smith, ASC/PKEIE, 2275 D Street, WPAFB, OH, 45433-7228, or emailed to denise.smith2@wpafb.af.mil<br />no later than 1:00 PM (Eastern Standard Time), Wednesday, 20 Jul 2011.</p>
<p>All questions shall be submitted in writing to Denise.Smith2@wpafb.af.mil with a courtesy copy to Stephen.Wharton@wpafb.af.mil</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this synopsis nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Quotation, Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does this issuance restrict the Government's acquisition approach. The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or part any industry input as a result of this announcement. The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of this effort. If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information. If the Government decides to award a contract for this or related effort, a notice will be published and posted on the FedBizOpps website.</p>

<DESC>PURPOSE: 
The Office of Civil Rights and Diversity (OCRD) and the Treasury Complaint Center (TCC) of the Department of the Treasury, is conducting this Request for Information (RFI) as market research to determine sources with CORE competencies and demonstrated experience in the development of an EEO File Digitization platform to allow OCRD/TCC practitioners to place each document in a file (discrimination complaints, correspondence, signed statements, and documentary evidence) in an electronic format on a SharePoint 2010 server and to generate a complete file in the Adobe portable document format (PDF).  In addition, OCRD/TCC has a requirement for development of customizable and fillable electronic forms that can be uploaded into the files on this EEO File Digitization platform.

SOURCES SOUGHT:   
THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) BEING RELEASED PURSUANT TO FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATIONS (FAR) PART 10 MARKET RESEARCH. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), and nothing shall be construed herein or through the RFI process to commit or obligate the Government to further action as a result of the RFI. In addition, contractors responding to this RFI shall bear all risk and expense of any resources used to provide the requested information. The information collected through this process is considered to be market research as described by FAR 2.101 and in accordance with FAR 10.002.

Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any further RFP/RFQ, if any is issued. This RFI is issued to assess the level of interest and capabilities of all small businesses.

REQUIREMENT SUMMARY:

Background:
Treasurys fourteen Bureau EEO Offices, OCRD, and TCC currently utilize the iComplaints (also known as iTrak) system, a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) product from Micropact Inc., to perform necessary tracking, management, and reporting activities in support of Treasurys EEO complaints reporting requirements.

Bureau EEO Offices are responsible for the intake and processing of informal complaints.  OCRD is responsible for overseeing the complaint process and for issuing final agency decisions.   TCC handles the formal complaint intake and the investigation processes.  The end result on each complaint is a paper file that typically contain hundreds of pages, and occasionally thousands of pages, and is sent to the following recipients:

	complainants and their representatives
	Treasury bureau EEO officers and counsel
	the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
	the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).

OCRD/ TCC requires a platform that will allow EEO practitioners to track, gather, and organize documents on EEO cases in a paperless complaint file that can easily be distributed to stakeholders in the complaint process.  In addition to the creation of an EEO File Digitalization platform, OCRD/TCC would like customize and fillable electronic forms to be developed, which can be uploaded into the EEO File Digitalization platform.  OCRD/TCC would like a platform that works seamlessly with iComplaints, the current database/ case tracking system.

Objectives:

The vendor will develop an application that can upload complaint files to the EEOC File Exchange (EFX) system and to other entities in Adobe PDF, with a resolution of a minimum 300 dots per inch (dpi), OCR (optical character recognition) image over text searchable by each word, Bates page numbering, and bookmarks.  The Bates numbers must be visible in the records in the system as well as when printed in paper form or exported to another electronic system.  The PDF documents must not contain any security settings, password protection, or other attributes that would restrict the EEOCs ability to open, cut and paste, copy, or otherwise use the files.  The vendor must work with the EEOCs staff and will ensure the EEOC can receive the files from the E-Complaint File application.

	Direct transfer of a PDF file to a disc and/or CD-ROM, with the option of adding password protection to each disc or CD-ROM.
	Storage of all documents in an electronic filing system based on file folders and grouped by case identifiers, with access by at least 150 concurrent users and with the capability to arrange/rearrange the order of the documents in any sequence using metadata.  
	Seamless integration or automatic transfer of information from the EEO File Digitalization platform into iComplaints.  Coordination with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) iComplaints administrators to determine best approach for seamless integration.

<SUBJECT>Correspondence Tracking Application
<SOLNBR>SECHQ1-2011-OITSB
<RESPDATE>071811
<CONTACT>Reginald Barnes, Email barnesr@sec.gov
<DESC><p>INTRODUCTION<br />The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is seeking information on a solution for a correspondence tracking application that will support the work of the agency in efficiently and effectively in responding to written correspondences.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the commission) currently uses several different applications to track incoming correspondence and outgoing responses. However these applications have limited interconnectivity between the systems. The combination of systems currently being used includes in-house developed correspondence tracking systems, commercially available SharePoint technology and a Sales Force application to track incoming and outgoing correspondences.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />The Commission seeks information regarding an integrated solution with key features to include correspondence tracking, document management and workflow management to replace the current correspondence tracking system. The upgraded application should possess several important functionalities, as outlined below:</p>
<p>&bull; The application must be able to track the incoming correspondence from initial receipt to the final response; <br />&bull; The application should facilitate the routing of the correspondence to the appropriate office or division with subject matter expertise within the Commission. From there, the draft response should be routed for approval or edit to other offices or divisions with roles in the response as appropriate;<br />&bull; At any point during the process staff should be able to determine the location of the response and the office/individual with possession/edit authority of the response;<br />&bull; The application must be able to store and catalog all incoming correspondence and the associated responses, including archiving the response as sent; <br />&bull; The application should facilitate collation by correspondent and/or constituent, date received, deadline to respond, current location, originating office within the Commission, final disposition, issue and subject;<br />&bull; The application should allow for staff to track changes on the response through the approval process with an internal content management function or with connectivity to existing Commission content management systems;<br />&bull; The administrator of the application must be able to compartmentalize the information seen or accessed by the various users, so that access can be restricted to only offices/divisions and their staff with a need to view or edit responses at any particular stage of the process;<br />&bull; Upon initial receipt, fields should be provided to note the name and address of the correspondent, the associated Office, the subject and issue identified, the date received and the recommended action; <br />&bull; The system should generate a unique identifier for this information and any associated documents that would assist in the tracking process; <br />&bull; The application should have the ability to use fields to standardize entry of information into the database;<br />&bull; Staff should be able to readily search the application by any fields with exact or partial keywords; <br />&bull; The application should be able to provide a report that shows the status, background information and location of the pending or finalized responses;<br />&bull; The application should have the ability to generate due dates and a production timeline by identifying the level or code of the response. The application should then be capable of producing Due Date alerts;<br />&bull; The application should have the ability to download emails to the correspondence database for processing;<br />&bull; The application should have the ability to integrate with MS Office and other specialized applications such as WorkShare Professional;<br />&bull; Ability to save scanned documents in the correspondence database or to connect to other site of stored data on the network; and<br />&bull; Ability to produce automated reports.</p>
<p>Your response to this RFI should include the technology solution requirements. This may include:</p>
<p>&bull; Information about the platforms, networking capabilities, databases, implementation processes, configuration options, and hardware requirements;<br />&bull; The ability for the SEC to securely use proprietary data within your solution;<br />&bull; Available end user and technical training and support services; and<br />&bull; Ongoing maintenance fees, support and licensing if applicable.</p>
<p>The Commission welcomes responses about products that partially fulfill the functionality described so long as they are available, operational and well-tested. Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) systems are not required but are preferable to custom-built solutions.</p>
<p>This RFI reflects the minimum functionality we seek. Respondents are encouraged to provide information on alternative and innovative solutions, functions, and designs, particularly if a respondent thinks it would produce superior results. <br />RFI respondents must respond in the form of a Capability Statement that addresses: 1) the product's ability to fulfill the above functionality, 2) your company's profile and capability in providing these types of solutions, if any, and 3) any other relevant information that would enhance the staff's understanding of the information submitted. If all or any portion of the required capabilities can be provided via commercial off the shelf software, please so indicate in your response. If you are interested in providing information, please send to Reginald Barnes at BarnesR@sec.gov. The SEC will consider all responses to this RFI as information only, not offers. All information must be sent via email to BarnesR@sec.gov by no later than the response deadline.</p>

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. This is NOT a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of commercially available products that may be of interest to the United States Coast Guard (USCG).
<p>The USCG Air Logistics Center is conducting market research to determine manufactures and suppliers described as follows: Spare components utilized on the HC-144A model aircraft. The USCG HC-144A is a pressurized, twin-turboprop aircraft with a high cantilever wing and retractable tricycle undercarriage. It is powered by two General Electric CT7-9C3 turboprops which drive Hamilton Standard 14RF-31 four-blade reverse-pitch propellers. The aircraft is specifically equipped to perform all USCG missions which include: search and rescue, maritime safety, security, and logistics, as well as national defense and protection of natural resources.</p>
<p>This procurement must be restricted to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) authorized sources, or firms who can effectively demonstrate their ability to provide the components and obtain the proprietary data required meeting form, fit, and function of the units. This requirement is necessary in order for the USCG to maintain the capability to adequately support all USCG missions. The OEM for the HC-144A is 0117B EADS Construcciones Aeronautic, Avenida Aragon, 404, Madrid, Spain 28022. The Coast Guard will not be able to provide manuals or drawings for this requirement. Interested parties must have access to the OEM data and manuals.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice should include company name, address, and telephone number, point of contact (POC), and complete product details, brochures, etc. which will allow the USCG to understand your product, configurations, auxiliary equipment, and options. Please state the approximate lead-time for acquiring your product and the details and terms of any standard warranty included with the product. Responses can be for all or for a few of the part numbers listed.</p>
<p>The Government believes the applicable NAICS code is 336413-Other Support Activities for Transportation. Please respond to the following questions (1) Is your business a large or small business and how many employees? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business? (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? (4) Is your firm a certified hub zone firm? (5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business? (6) Is your firm a certified Service Disabled Veteran-Owned? (7) Is your product listed on a GSA schedule? (8) Do you have other government agencies using the product, and if so which agencies, POCs and contract numbers? (9) If possible, provide POCs for civilian users for general usage of product questions. After the review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, and if the government still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in the FedBizOpps. Responses to this sources sought synopsis are not adequate response to any future solicitation announcement. All interested offerors will have to respond to the solicitation in addition to responding to this sources sought synopsis. Again, this is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. Responses to this sources notice shall be mailed to Deborah Krull at U.S. Coast Guard, Elizabeth City, North Carolina, 27909-0501 or e-mailed to Deborah.Krull@uscg.mil. TELEPHONE RESPONSES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. Responses must be received no later than September 30, 2011. Firms responding to this announcement that fail to provide all of the required information cannot be used to help the Government make the appropriate acquisition decisions which is the intent of this sources sought notice. This notice is to help the USCG in determining potential sources only. All firms responding to this sources sought notice are advised that their response to this notice is not a request to be considered for a contract award. All interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from the responses to this announcement. Responses to this sources sought synopsis are NOT a request to be added to a prospective offerors list or to receive a copy of the solicitation.</p>

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the US Army  Warfighter Science, Technology and Applied Research Directorate (WARSTAR), intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: Delco Corporation, Akron, OH 44312.<br><br>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. <br><br>RESPONSES WILL BE RECEIVED FOR FUTURE REQUIREMENT CONSIDERATION ONLY.<br><br>NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE. <br> <br>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <br><br>This contract is anticipated to design and produce compression molding tools required to fabricate new lightweight helmets, based on new information regarding optimal geometry discovered by Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC). Rapid heating and cooling of the processing tool is required to process these materials. Currently, Delco Corporation has developed proprietary production methods to produce compression molding tooling technologies. Deliverables are one single cavity compression mold to produce a size large combat vehicle crewman-type helmet shell; one flat plate compression mold; one dual cavity compression mold to produce a size large combat vehicle crewman-type ear cup shell and drawings in paper and electronic format. <br><br>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <br><br>Delco's Compression mold technologies are the result of unique capabilities, equipment and proprietary production methods to manufacture tooling for helmet-shaped geometries that provide for rapid heating and cooling. Their unique production methods can produce steam heated and water cooled production-grade, highly instrumented, compression molding tools which are capable to withstanding 350 ton-force loading during compression molding of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene sheet goods when the initial distribution of material is up to 20%; 150 psi steam pressure loading; and are capable of immediate switching from 150 psi steam pressure loading to 45 F water cooling. There processes are necessary for certain types of armor materials.<br><br>3. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<br><br>Over the past 20 years, NSRDEC has conducted continual assessments of industrial capabilities and has conducted periodic market searches to determine available and/or emerging suitable technologies for technology assessment of advanced armor technologies. Based on their knowledge of the field of armor materials, we believe that presently only Delco has the technology and ability to demonstrate the required technology. This is due in part to the unique salient features of this equipment and due to proprietary processes and features of the Delco equipment. The key feature that is unique to Delco is the ability to heat and cool the mold very rapidly. <br><br>4. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:<br><br>Compression molding tools are required to develop new processing methods for armor materials, including new methods to process ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene materials at high temperatures. NSRDEC continues to conduct research on both improved materials and improved processing methods for improved ballistic protection and lighter weight helmets. <br><br>5. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: <br><br>NSRDEC is presently developing drawings and specifications for compression molding tooling. <br><br>6.

<DESC>Introduction: Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems Directorate (PM FSS), intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: Therm Tec, Inc., Cipole Rd, Sherwood, OR 97140-8339.<br><br>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. <br><br>NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE. <br><br>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <br><br>The Army's Maneuver Support and Sustainment Centers of Excellence have identified safe solid waste disposal as a capability gap in Contingency Basing. To help fill gaps at smaller camps such as 50 and 150- person, Commercial off the shelf (COTS), lightweight, portable incinerators need to be purchased for test and evaluation. A COTS solution is required to reduce cost, schedule, and performance risks associated with this evaluation and future large quantity, competitive procurements. The evaluation will determine if a COTS incinerator is suitable and effective in Contingency Base-camping at sites of 150 persons or less. Criteria for camps of 150 personnel and below include the incinerator must be small enough for it to be transported and set up at the most austere camps where material handling equipment is limited. The incinerator must be able to fit in a single, standard ISO-container, and weigh less than 9500 pounds. Incinerators must also have 2 stages of incineration as a pollution control and be able to treat 400-1200 pounds per day of solid waste. Unlike other waste disposal technologies, incineration is well proven, portable, and exists in the commercial market. Incinerators for camps greater than 150 personnel are not part of the evaluation and those will have different criteria to meet.<br><br>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <br><br>In order to assure an adequate sampling of the commercial market, PMFSS needs to purchase multiple candidate incinerators from several different vendors to verify the general market of COTS incinerators will perform reliably and safely enough to sustain the small base camps. Extensive market research was done in 2010, which will be explained in further detail below. There were only three vendors found in the research that meet all the criteria of paragraph 1 above, because all other incinerators are too large. Several smaller incinerators from Inciner8, Thermtec, and Elastec met the criteria, so one of each is planned to be purchased via separate purchase requests for each vendor. Three, funded, separate purchase requests are currently in process. The incinerators will then be subjected to comparative performance and reliability test and evaluation to lower the performance risk during future large quantity, competitive procurements. . The sole source for this purchase request is Inciner8, which has three different incinerator models that meet the criteria Model A1600X, Model A60, and Model A850(A)2. These three models will be evaluated for camps of 150 persons or below.<br><br><br>3. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<br><br>Sources Sought Notice W91GVY-FSS-LOE-1-E2 was posted on Fed Biz Ops in March 2010 and responses were delivered to PMFSS by 30 April 2010. In addition to posting the notice, PMFSS also contacted known suppliers of incinerators and informed them of the notice. The notice asked for information regarding incinerators with throughput capacities 500-6000 pounds per day, and a wide range of responses was received. The other sources who have models meeting the criteria are Elastec and Thermtec and their models will also be purchased for evaluation via separate purchase requests (See W91GVY-1145-1047 and W91GVY-1136-1005). Incinerators from the research that do not meet the criteria of less than 9500 pounds or fit in a single container are not being considered for this performance evaluation.<br><br>4. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:<br><br>Market research indicates there are several candidate incinerators that are small enough to transport and effectively treat the solid waste at the 150-person camp and below. The Inciner8 A1600X, A850(A)2, and A60 models are three of them and are specified in this Purchase Request. Purchase requests for the other candidates (Elastec, and Thermtec) from the market research will be placed separately. By evaluating multiple COTS incinerators from various suppliers, the Army will be better able to manage the performance risks when it procures large quantities of production units for use at camps of 150 persons and below.<br><br>5. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: <br><br>The purpose of this effort is only to validate performance of the COTS solution before ordering COTS in large quantities for base camps. Once COTS performance is verified, a detailed performance specification can be completed and multiple vendors will be able to compete for production contracts.<br><br>6.

Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition(Limited or Sole Source Justification)(Refer 10 FAR 6.303-2 for further guidance on information to be provided)
Subject of Justification- Sole Source Invasive Species Contract with South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks
US Department of Interior, Bureau of ReclamationGreat Plains Region Acquisition Management DivisionBillings, Montana
1 - Office requesting the actionRapid City Field Office
2- Description of proposed actionSole Source Acquisition
3- Description of services or supplies neededInvasive species treatments Bureau of Reclamation lands at Angostura, Belle Fourche, Shadehill Reservoirs and James Diversion lands.
4- Estimated cost$365,000 ($73,000 annual x 5 years)
5- AuthorityFAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source
5a- Address specifically how the authority appliesReclamation has Memorandum of Understandings with the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks (SDGFP) for the management of the above Reclamation lands. SDGFP is the sole agency responsible for these lands regarding recreation, wildlife and related uses. Treating invasive species has been one of SDGFP's tasks related to overseeing these lands. SDGFP is the best agency to perform these tasks because:
1. SDGFP has acquired loca1 knowledge and experience with the existing and potential invasive species issues on the approximately 8,763 acres or lands that they have managed for years and sometimes for decades. SDGFP has historic knowledge of where invasives have been treated in the past and if and where follow-up treatments are necessary. SDGFP personnel are trained in invasive species recognition and arc guided by a South Dakota state licensed pesticide applicator program. SDGFP is uniquely situated with staff on hand and a constant presence to monitor and rapidly respond to a variety of invasive species infestations. This results in cost savings and good land management practices since infestations are not likely to become large, out of control, costly to treat, and rehabilitate.
2. Reclamation does not have the personnel or resources to provide a constant presence to effectively and efficiently perform the invasive species monitoring, mapping, and treatment activities on these lands. From the Rapid City Field Office, personnel would have to travel 314 miles to James Diversion Dam, 58 miles to Angostura Reservoir, 183 miles to Shadehill Reservoir, and 52 miles to Belle Fourche Reservoir.
6- Effort made to obtain offers from multiple sourcesSouth Dakota Department of Game, Fish, and Parks
7- Description of market research performedFor market purpose research comparisons, Reclamation has not entered into large scale invasive species management contracts in the State of South Dakota. A comparison can be made with Seminoe Reservoir's 2009 salt cedar control contract on approximately 97.5 acres in Wyoming. The three bids received were:Wyoming Helicopters, Inc, $17,900 total or $184 per acreBack Country Spraying, $41,995 total or $431 per acrePrecision Industrial Applicators, $43,875 total or $450 per acre
The above bids were for a relatively small area for one invasive plant compared to the SDGFP's invasive species management services, which includes management for many different invasives in many scattered areas within thousands of acres of Rec1amation land throughout South Dakota.  In addition, SDGFP monitors for invasives on Reclamation's 8,763 acres or lands in South Dakota.  This on-site presence gives them flexibility and availability to manage invasives that is not provided by a private weed spraying contractor.
8- Determination of fair and reasonable costThe proposed annual $73, 000 contract, renewable for up to five years, is based on a need for invasive species control and is limited by Reclamation's budget for invasive species control in South Dakota. The determination that it is fair and reasonable is based on past experience of work completed by SDGFP.  For example, at Angostura Reservoir the SDGFP Parks and Recreation Division manages 2,990 acres of developed recreation, primitive, and concession areas.  In 2009, SDGFP treated 183 acres of invasives. Reclamation provided a portion of the funds for this effort, which was $23,464. The cost per acre for Reclamation funds is $128. A hidden cost that is not reflected in this per acre account is that SDGFP personnel provide many services under their invasives species program administration that includes, but is not limited to: employee commercial applicator certification, equipment use and upkeep, administration, and monitoring for invasives during their field site visits and daily activities. Monitoring is an important component for early detection and rapid response in any invasives species program. If it is conservatively said that SDGFP personnel monitored just the 823 acres of the developed recreation areas, then the $23,464 dollars in Reclamation funds can actually equate to $28.50 per acre. This level of detail would not be possible under current Reclamation personnel staffing levels and existing budget constraints.
9- Other facts supporting use of other than full and open competitiono SDGFP is a governmental entity that is not for profit so they may provide an economical service to Reclamation.o SDGFP's experience results in savings to Reclamation by their ability to be on hand to monitor, provide oversight, and treat invasive species. SDGFP is trained in invasive species recognition, use of different treatments, and will provide control of a variety of invasives, as necessary. Their local knowledge and field reviews allow them to spot infestations and provide the required control without Reclamation needing to supply personnel to survey and create maps of every infestation of every different kind of invasive species on scattered lands throughout the state.
10- List any sources that have expressed interest in this proposed acquisitionNo other sources.
11- Effort to overcome barriers to competition for future acquisitionSDGFP has unique qualifications, experience, and resources for invasive species treatments on Reclamation's South Dakota lands that are not available competitively from private weed control contractors.

<p>VITROS ECi Immunodiagnostic System from Ortho-Clinical Diagnostic has been used by DVH consistently since 2004 to measure incident and chronic infection with hepatitis viruses in the National Health Survey and other important public health studies. The diagnostic kits and consumables for this system have been approved by FDA, validated in our laboratory and are required for us to perform consistent laboratory service for the NHANES and other important public health studies. Since this is a closed diagnostic platform, VITROS ECi Immunodiagnostic System can perform serologic testing for viral hepatitis using VITROS ECi Kits of reagents and corresponding VITROS ECi consumables only. Kits and consumables from other vendor are not compatible with this diagnostic platform. Purchase of other kits would require another set of equipment and additional validation that would cost time and money for our program.</p>
<p><br />The Division Hepatitis Reference Laboratory, Division of Viral Hepatitis Laboratory Branch, will purchase the VITROS ECi Kits of reagents and corresponding VITROS ECi consumables from Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics due to the fact that these will function on VITROS ECi Immunodiagnostic System that is already in our laboratory. They are the only manufacturer that makes these and is the sole vendor of the reagents. <br /><br />It is the understanding of the Government that an award to any other source would cause unacceptable delays in meeting the requirements of the Government.

In 2010, CBP alone apprehended over 1200 detainees per day who had to be transported and guarded.

<DESC>This is a sole source synopsis issued in accordance with FAR 5.203(a) and FAR 13.106-1(b).  DARPA intends to issue a sole sorce purchase order to the National Engineering Center of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU-NREC) to support the DARPA/TTO META Program.
<p>This purchase order will fulfill the need for a set of system and component models sufficiently detailed to exercise the META tools currently under development. The META program is at a stage when tool maturation and integration requires the use of such a set of models. This purchase is essential to the completion of the META program since it supplies the necessary component models.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a past performer on the DARPA UGCV (Crusher) program and the TARDEC Autonomous Platform Demonstrator (APD) program, CMU-NREC is the only entity with the background and resources to provide the required model set. CMU-NREC can deliver a coherent and fully representative set of models encompassing the Drivetrain cooling system. This set of models would require a different performer to recreate the existing CMU-NREC capability, or design an entirely separate vehicle. As a result of the above qualifications, CMU-NREC is uniquely qualified to perform this urgent work, and it is deemed to be in the best interests of the Government to award this Purchase Order to CMU-NREC on a sole source basis.&nbsp; This announcment constitutes the only synopsis for this requirement, is not a request for proposals, or an RFP of any kind, and is issued for notification purposes only.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Region Seven (7), Alaska, intends to award a sole source, firm-fixed price purchase for six (6) months to Wright State University.  The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Region Seven (7), Alaska, requires the services of caribou antler surveys and bone data analysis.
Back Ground:Access to calving grounds and migration routes are important to the health and survival of arctic caribou herds.  However, caribou management (especially for the Porcupine Caribou Herd - PCH) is complicated by the high geographic variability of calving ground localities observed from 1972 to 2010.  Particularly for establishing the climatic influences on calving ground choice and other broad biogeographic patterns, management of the PCH and other herds could benefit from an extended historical observation window. Such observations can come from surveying and analyzing distributions of shed caribou antlers on landscape surfaces. This contract will produce such a survey and test our current understanding of caribou calving grounds by acquiring a longer temporal perspective.
As part of this research, it is also important to understand the duration over which antlers survive on arctic landscapes. Antlers are removed from the system through slow weathering processes and direct consumption by local mammal populations. The nutritional value of antlers (and changes in nutritional value through time) and to determine the overall survival duration of antlers in the arctic refuge, nutrient analyses and radiocarbon dating will also be performed.
Work Description:The contractor will survey up to three sites on the Arctic NWR for shed antlers according to specific methods designed by the contractor as outlined in Miller (2010, 2011). Samples of antler bone will be collected from the refuge for radiocarbon dating and nutrient analyses.
Specific responsibilities and analyses include: (1) the definition of study areas for survey transects that include areas of variable use across the last 40 years of calving history, (2) survey transects for bones according to methods outlined in Miller (2010), (3) identify bones and bone fragments to species, ontogenetic age, gender, scavenging damage (carnivore, ungulate, or bird), and proportion remaining, (4) identify antlers and antler fragments to gender (using the proprietary antler database: Miller unpublished data), (5) using a unique technique (Miller 2009, 2010, 2011) determine weathering stages of antler bone (thus, providing relative postmortem duration) and determine weathering stages of all encountered bone remains, (6) determine the ratio of newborn to adult/sub-adult caribou for each transect, (7) calculate differences in the geographic distribution of calf:non-calf caribou in different regions of the refuge, (8) calculate concentrations between different genders of antlers in different areas of the refuge, (9) Recalculate all of the above using bones in different weathering stages to test for changes in historical calving use patterns through time, (10) compare historical calving ground use with current patterns of calving (as determined by modern survey data), (11) establish the duration over which antlers survive on the landscape (using radiocarbon dating), (12) characterize the nutritional value of antlers and changes in those values during the decay process (based on weathering stages), (13) incorporate nutritional value of antlers through post-shed time to establish consumptive pressures of antlers on the landscape and any biases caused by variability in consumptive pressure over time, and (14) produce final report on all methods and findings.
This notice is not a request for competitive proposals and the Government does not intend to accepts proposals received.

<p><span style="COLOR: black">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS), LLC under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), </span><span style="COLOR: black; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">is offering the opportunity to license the batteryless sensor using a nanoenergy harvester technology.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span>:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Existing nanosensor technologies depend on an external power source (typically a battery) to operate. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has developed a superior alternative: the first batteryless sensors that harvest environmental energy supplies using one-dimensional semiconducting nanowire arrays. The commercial applications for this technology include readily deployable self-powered chemical sensors for military, industrial, medical, and environmental applications. By freeing the nanosensor from a tethered power supply, LLNL scientists have provided the new standard for portable chemical detectors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description</span>: </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt">Chemical and biological sensors based on nanowire or nanotube technologies exhibit observable ultrasensitive detection limits due to their unusually large surface-to-volume architecture. This suggests that nanosensors can provide a distinct advantage over conventional designs. This advantage is further enhanced when the nanosensor can harvest its meager power requirements from the surrounding environment. A self-powering or "batteryless" device can made small enough to serve in unique situations ranging from military to medical applications. LLNL researchers successfully fabricated two prototype platforms for batteryless chemical detectors using one-dimensional semiconductor nanowires.</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><br />The best currently available nanogenerators can capture, convert, store, and use the energy inherent in piezoelectrics (mechanical/vibration energy), thermoelectrics (heat energy), and photovoltaics (solar and other light energy). The LLNL research team believes that matrix-assisted energy conversion is the next step in eliminating the need for batteries and other external power sources. In this system, polar organic molecules interact with partially exposed nanowires to form a nanoconverter.<br /><span style="COLOR: #548dd4; mso-themecolor: text2; mso-themetint: 153"><br /></span>This self-powered platform relies on the response of a polymeric film to drive the piezoelectric effect in a nanowire array. The hybrid organic/inorganic platform begins with a nanowire array embedded in an environmentally responsive organic polymer (PVC). This matrix sits atop a support substrate. Both ZnO and boron-doped Si nanowires have proved to be excellent sensor materials. Two sensing platforms were therefore created, based on these two materials. The working principle of the nanosensor on each platform relies on the partial exposure of semiconducting nanowires to target chemical species and a non-ohmic contact that is necessary for the nanosensors to function. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR
 OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
FAR 6.302-5, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1)


1.  Agency and Contracting Activity Identification: The VISN 22 Network Contracting Activity, as directed by the VA Southern Nevada Healthcare System, will enter into a Purchase Order that requires justification for other than full and open competition. The Purchase Order Number is 593-X17000.

2. Nature of Acquisition Being Approved:  VASNHS has a requirement for natural gas piping facilities for the Central Plant and Kitchen at the new North Las Vegas Medical Center (Project CA2202). The proposed solicitation shall result in a firm-fixed price construction contract.  

3. Description of Requirement:  The Contractor shall 1) excavate and backfill a 36" wide and 24" deep trench from the existing pipe on Walnut Street to the VA property line, and backfill after the piping installation; 2) install polyethylene pipe from Deer Springs Road to the SE corner of the new Medical Center (at the east end of the Warehouse) and backfill the trench; and 3) install polyethylene pipe from the property line at Walnut Street to the Energy Center (NW corner of Cooling Tower Yard) and backfill the trench. The period of performance is July 18, 2011, through September 30, 2011.  The independent Government estimated cost is $113,774.00.
 
4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:  The services are being procured under the authority of 41 U.S.C. (c) (2), FAR Part 6.302-1(a).

5.  The Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: Southwest Gas Corporation, operating under the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada, is the sole natural gas provider in Southern Nevada. Generally, when contracting for utility services the Contractor installs the facilities required to provide services and charges a monthly facility cost recovery rate to the customer. Southwest Gas Corporation refuses to execute a tendered contract as outlined in FAR 41.201(b), or a GSA Areawide Contract, specifically stating they require all customers to use their forms and clauses, which is prohibited under the referenced Clause. Moreover, Southwest Gas Corporation requires the facilities installation be performed by a Contractor they have certified, and will not allow their certified Contractors to perform the services under separate contract with the customer.

6. A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers From as Many Potential Sources As Practicable and Whether a Notice Will Be Publicized. Research was conducted via the Internet and in direct contact with GSA to identify whether there were any GSA Areawide Contracts; searched the "Newcomers & Visitors Guide" section of the Embarq Yellow Pages for Las Vegas, NV; and searched the Centralized Contractor Registry for natural gas service providers. There are no GSA Areawide Contracts for natural gas or other natural gas service providers in Southern Nevada. A notice has been publicized for this procurement.


DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS NETWORK 22 LOGISTICS OFFICE JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
FAR 6.302-1, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1)

7. Anticipated Cost: The anticipated cost should be fair and reasonable to the Government based on the Using Service estimate utilizing RS Means, and performance uncertainties can be identified and reasonable estimates of their cost impact can be made. The Contractor is willing to accept a firm fixed-price representing assumption of the risks involved.

8. Results of Market Survey:  Southwest Gas Corporation is the only responsible source providing natural gas services in Southern Nevada.

9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition: None.  

10. Any Other Interested Sources? There are no other sources that have expressed an interest to date.  

11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take To Remove or Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition is required: It is not anticipated that any subsequent requirement will be needed by the Government. 

12. I hereby certify that the above is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)RFI #64783 - IT Asset Discovery
The following is a Request for Information to be used for Market Research purposes.  The Government reserves the right to issue a solicitation and/or award as a result of the market research resulting from this RFI.
The following sections represent DRAFT sections of a requirement which may or may not be released by the Department of Interior Office of the Chief Information Officer.  The Acquisition Services Directorate seeks information in the form of direct responses as identified at the end of the document.  Responses are due on or before July 14, 2011 to Mr Alan Rumney at alan.rumney@aqd.nbc.gov and should cite "RFI #64783 - Asset Discovery" in the subject line.  Responses are limited to NO MORE THEN 2 PAGES in 12 pt font.  
1.  BACKGROUND  The Department of the Interior (DOI) and its subordinate Bureaus and Offices are responsible for protecting and providing access to our Nation's natural and cultural heritage, and to honor our trust responsibilities to Indian Tribes and our commitments to island communities.  To achieve its mission, the DOI utilizes Information Technology (IT) extensively throughout the organization.  To properly manage its IT assets, the DOI must not only have an accurate listing of the hardware and software components that make up DOI's IT portfolio, but also have clear and complete understanding of the critical characteristics of these assets.
The DOI intends to procure an asset discovery service solution to support its IT Asset Inventory program.  This solution will provide the DOI Office of the Chief Information Officer and supported DOI agencies with critical information about DOI's IT asset inventory which will be use to manage the DOI IT asset portfolio in areas including IT program management, hardware and software lifecycle management, systems security, and cost/utilization efficiency analyses.

2.  SCOPEProposed solutions should be based on a service delivery model which focuses on delivering the required outcomes without substantial overhead purchases of new hardware and/or software.  These outcomes are detailed in Section 3 of this SOO, and shall include the following characteristics:- Proven to work with multiple IT platforms, across widely geographically-distributed systems utilizing often restricted bandwidth,- Detects all types of IT assets located throughout the DOI WAN, - Utilizes "AGENT-LESS" technologies that performs asset discovery without requiring additional software to be installed on targeted IT components,- Is able to discover "virtual" machines and components,- Maximizes use of existing DOI infrastructure and components as part of the solution,- Minimizes impact of DOI IT system users,- Requires minimal DOI IT personnel support to set-up and/or run,- Results in a detailed, searchable, and both automatically and manually updatable library of assets and asset characteristics.
DOI intends to procure services to discover and report on the total IT asset inventory supporting 75,000 to 100,000 DOI system users in locations that currently include: - Large scale and complex DOI  facilities in the Washington, DC and Denver, Colorado metro areas,- Nationwide DOI offices facilities throughout the United States, Alaska, and US Territories.- Remote workers, i.e., non-office-based workers who may work from home or may be mobile at remote locations.
3.  ObjectivesService Delivery Model:  the proposed methodology for delivering this capability must have the following characteristics:
The "end product" of this effort is exclusively data/information about DOI's IT asset inventory connected to the network.The government requirements are focused solely on delivery of the end product, and not on the delivery of the technologies/methods used to create the product.  It shall be the vendor's responsibility to obtain and utilize the necessary resources (equipment, personnel, information, etc) to provide the services needed to deliver the end product described in this document, therefore:- Delivery of the end product will not require the government to purchase, lease, or otherwise acquire any new hardware, software, equipment, or other technologies/capabilities,  - Delivery of the end product will not require the government to directly hire, contract, or sub-contract any additional personnel,- The vendor is responsible for developing and executing a project plan that identifies to the government, all required systems/facilities accesses, configurations requirements, project lead-times, and other pertinent project management details required to successfully deliver the required IT asset inventory,- The vendor has primary responsibility for managing the successful delivery of the end product and will proactively work to identify and resolve all potential service delivery issues, - Service delivery issues resulting from the actions (or inactions) of the government will be reported to the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) as soon as possible. 
Asset Library/Asset Reporting:  The "End Product" of this effort is delivery of an accurate and complete Asset Library, which is updated regularly to ensure it contains the highest quality information about DOI's IT assets, including:IT Assets Inventory:  The vendor deliver shall deliver an as complete as possible inventory of DOI's IT assets located throughout the DOI WAN.  This inventory shall include identification of all IP enabled devices (including both physical and virtual machines) and connected peripheral equipment.  Asset Characteristics:  The Asset Library shall also contain relevant asset characteristic information including: - Product Identification: data that specifically identifies the exact product installed, including version identification, product design specifications, product compatibility information, and supported system requirements.   - Manufacturer Identification: data that specifically identifies the exact product manufacturer, for both including the original equipment/software manufacturer (OEM/OSM) and current product manufacturer (if changed since install). - Product Lifecycle: data that details product licensing information, end-of-life/end-of-support data, and product upgrade paths (as applicable).

4.  Deliverables  Proof of Concept - Phase I:  Within XX days of award, the vendor will deliver to the government, for review and acceptance; the plans, prototypes, and test results necessary to demonstrate a high likelihood of success for delivery of the services described in this work statement.  The government will have up to XX days to review and provide acceptance of the vendor's final Proof of Concept.
Implementation - Phase II (Optional Task Based On Successful Phase I): Within XX days of notification by the government of the acceptance of the results of the Proof of Concept Phase, the vendor shall perform an initial scan of the DOI's network and deliver to the government, for review and acceptance,  the Asset Library.  The government will have up to XX days to review and submit to the vendor a report identifying any deficiencies in the library.  The vendor will have up to XX days to respond to the government's report and correct any deficiencies, including performing any necessary additional scans.   
Steady-State - Phase III (Optional Task Based On Successful Phase II): upon government acceptance of the service Implementation, the vendor shall perform quarterly scans and updates as necessary for all data/information contained in the DOI asset library. 

RFI Questions (Responses are limited to 2 pages total)
1. Do you believe the three phase solution is appropriate to the proposed task and will work?  If not, what would you suggest for deliverables that still meet the needs of the Government?2. What key information (if any additional) would be needed by the vendor community to successfully be able to provide a quote or proposal to a future solicitation?3. Do you see this as a Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) solution or would it be exceedingly customized to meet the needs of the Government?4. Are you a small business? (yes/no)5. Do you offer a solution for this on GSA Schedules or an existing GWAC usable by all Federal Agencies, or would this need to be procured as an Open Market solution?6. Can this be done without travel (i.e. remotely) or with minimal travel?7. Are there any other comment, useful information, or processes the Government should incorporate into a requirements document to guarantee project success?

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Accelrys, Inc., for Software Maintenance Support, to be used by the Optical Technology Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland.
<p>Sole Source determination is based on the need for continuous software maintenance for the DMOL3 and the Material Studio Visualizer interface. The DMOL3 is NIST's primary computational instrument, capable in comparing the numerical results from new calculations with the old DMOL3 results. The software will allow NIST to perform quantum mechanical calculations using density functional theory on molecules, surfaces, and solids. The key features for performance and functions are the numerical atom-centered basis sets, which allow the same level of theory to be used for small organic molecules as for solids and surfaces. DMOL3 is also an all electron code, and does not require the use of less accurate pseudopotentials or muffin tins to describe core electrons. Accelrys Inc., is the only known vendor capable in providing the required software license and maintenance renewal.</p>

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Weather Service intends to award a sole source contract to International Business Machines (IBM) for the supply and installation of required IBM components to re-align the National Weather Service Telecommunication Gateway (NWSTG).&nbsp; <br /><br />The NWSTG is a central source and communications switching system for millions of hydrometeorological observations and products each day. The NWSTG's main functions include ingest (e.g., data capture or receipt), switching, and interfacing to outward-facing systems (e.g., for broadcast and web services). The NWSTG is a major and critical component of the NWS' Telecommunication Operations Center (TOC), located primarily in Silver Spring, Md. The TOC/NWSTG serves a broad array of users: internal NOAA users, and domestic and international external users.
<p>The NWS must undertake a technology realignment of the NWSTG for reasons that can be summarized as follows:<br />1. projections for steep increases in data volume related to GOES-R, and changes to other sensor and modeling systems; studies have indicated the current NWSTG systems will not accommodate the future data loads,<br />2. the current NWSTG has limited and outdated data search and data discovery functionality; such search/discovery functionality is central to NextGen, AWIPS Data Distribution, and other NOAA projects,<br />3. significant number of NWSTG infrastructure are at or near end-of-life; a considerable number of potential security vulnerabilities or weaknesses have been identified; the system is relatively inflexible in its ability to respond to new requirements, and, backup capabilities are incomplete (threatening continuity of operations provided by this critical infrastructure).</p>
<p>NOAA-internal requirements associated with the GOES-R series, NPOESS Preparatory Project, dual polarization radar, new environmental production models, NextGen, AWIPS and other projects require profound NWSTG enhancements. Moreover, NOAA-external requirements- such as those related to DoD peering and the NWSTG as a WMO Global Information System Centre-impose further requirements that affect the future NWSTG.</p>
<p>The schedule for the new data volumes and magnitude of the technology refresh is unprecedented. Calendar years 2011 and 2012 are critical for improving the Gateway infrastructure before the onset of new programs identified above impact the system in FY 2013. In order for NOAA to meet this aggressive timeline, NOAA must have contract services with a full range of IBM hardware and software experience, as well as the ability to provision, install and configure IBM hardware/software and equipment.</p>
<p>IBM contractors have the requisite hardware and software knowledge and experience of performing the vital integration, hardware and software migration, and customization activities with their hardware and software products needed to meet the NWSTG realignment schedule. In addition, IBM has extensive and irreplaceable knowledge from years of working with the NOAA and in the existing NWSTG infrastructure.<br /><br />Please send any questions or inquiries to the Contracting Officer prior to the close of the response date of this announcement.</p>

<DESC>INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE


The Veterans Affairs Mid-Atlantic Healthcare Region (VISN 6) Central Acquisition Service intends to enter into a sole source procurement with Philips Medical Systems, 22100 Bothell Everett Hwy, Bothell, WA 98041.  The items being purchased are necessary labor and materials to repair/restore Philips X-Ray equipment (Pixium 4600 Detector).  The problem is that the digital detector will not calibrate which is causing deterioration of image quality.

NAICS code 811219 applies to this procurement.  The proposed contract action is for service for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to meet this requirement.  This notice of Intent is not a request for quotations. Interested parties who believe they can meet this requirement are to submit information to: Dori Dabbs, Contract Specialist, at dori.dabbs2@va.gov.  Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.   All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government. 

If no response is received by July 15, 2011 10:00AM EST, specifying that comparable service is available that would be more advantageous to the government than obtaining the service through a sole source procurement with Philips Medical Systems, a sole source award will be made.  

This award will be made using simplified acquisition procedures. No solicitation will be made available. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to release a solicitation to upgrade to the web based version of the Alion CM tool to the incumbent contractor, Alion Science and Technology Corporation, 1759 Tysons Blvd., Suite 1300, McLean, VA 22102. The proposed contract action will provide&nbsp;an upgrade to Air Cargo's current version of the commercial off the shelf (COTS) product CounterMeasures Software, which provides technical integration with other TSA branches that use the CounterMeasures Software, report engineering services, data management services, and project management support.&nbsp; The upgrade will improve data sharing between TSA branches that utilize this software and will enable an enterprise version of CounterMeasures with Multi-Modal modules to be housed on the Transportation Operating Platform (TOP).
<p>A non-competititve contract action is required because the software tool, CounterMeasures, is a licensed product and Alion Science &amp; Technology is the exclusive developer with sole data development rights. It would not be cost effective in terms of time, cost, and effort for TSA to acquire a separate contract to provide/replace the currently utilized software. The period of performance for this sole-source contract will be for 12 months (base year) from the date of award with four one(1) year options.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Government.</p>

<p><br />CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p>52.209-5 -- Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters<br />(a)<br />(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --<br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --<br />(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and<br />(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and<br />(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(2) Examples.<br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.<br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.<br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.<br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.<br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p><br />FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commerical Items. Evaulation factors are based on price and past performance.<br />Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />Technical Capability (Proper Crane equipment - IE: 50 Ton Crane, with a fully qualified operator - see requirements)</p>
<p>Price</p>
<p>Past Performance</p>
<p><br />Technical capability is relatively more important than price. Price is relatively more important than past performance, however, past performance is still of high importance when compared to price.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (End of Provision)</p>
<p><br />52.216-1 -- Type of Contract.<br />Type of Contract (Apr 1984)<br />The Government contemplates award of a Firm Fixed Priced Contract resulting from this solicitation. (End of Provision)</p>
<p>FAR 52.217-8 OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES (NOV 1999)<br />The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 60 days (End of clause)</p>
<p><br />52.228-10 -- Vehicular and General Public Liability Insurance<br />Vehicular and General Public Liability Insurance (Apr 1984)<br />(a) The Contractor, at the Contractor's expense, agrees to maintain, during the continuance of this contract, vehicular liability and general public liability insurance with limits of liability for --<br />(1) Bodily injury of not less than $ (Minimal Texas State Standard) for each person and $ (Minimal Texas State Standard) for each occurrence; and<br />(2) Property damage of not less than $ (Minimal Texas State Standard) for each accident and $ (Minimal Texas State Standard) in the aggregate.<br />(b) The Contractor also agrees to maintain workers' compensation and other legally required insurance with respect to the Contractor's own employees and agents.</p>
<p><br />52.246-20 -- Warranty of Services.<br />As prescribed in 46.710(d), insert a clause substantially as follows:<br />Warranty of Services (May 2001)<br />(a) Definitions.<br />"Acceptance," as used in this clause, means the act of an authorized representative of the Government by which the Government assumes for itself, or as an agent of another, ownership of existing and identified supplies, or approves specific services, as partial or complete performance of the contract.<br />(b) Notwithstanding inspection and acceptance by the Government or any provision concerning the conclusiveness thereof, the Contractor warrants that all services performed under this contract will, at the time of acceptance, be free from defects in workmanship and conform to the requirements of this contract. The Contracting Officer shall give written notice of any defect or nonconformance to the Contractor within 1 hour of notification. <br />This notice shall state either --<br />(1) That the Contractor shall correct or reperform any defective or nonconforming services; or<br />(2) That the Government does not require correction or reperformance.<br />(c) If the Contractor is required to correct or reperform, it shall be at no cost to the Government, and any services corrected or reperformed by the Contractor shall be subject to this clause to the same extent as work initially performed. If the Contractor fails or refuses to correct or reperform, the Contracting Officer may, by contract or otherwise, correct or replace with similar services and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned to the Government thereby, or make an equitable adjustment in the contract price.<br />(d) If the Government does not require correction or reperformance, the Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in the contract price.(End of Clause)</p>

<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK <br /><br />To set up and maintain a secure file repository of radiographic images, and associated relevant medical information, relating to occupational respiratory diseases, particularly those associated with pneumoconioses.</p>
<p>I. Background <br />Statement of Work</p>
<p>Project Identification &amp; Purpose: <br />To set up and maintain a secure file repository of radiographic images, and associated relevant medical information, relating to occupational respiratory diseases, particularly those associated with pneumoconioses. The repository is intended to store digitally-acquired x-ray and computerized tomography (CT) chest images, and associated relevant medical information, taken for a variety of reasons, including medical screening, surveillance, epidemiology, clinical practice, or research studies. The repository will be employed for various applications, including the development of new national or international reference image standards, the development of education, training, and testing materials, the establishment of quality assurance collections, and for research into improved methods of disease identification and classification.</p>
<p>Background and Need:<br />NIOSH is the federal agency responsible for conducting research and making recommendations for the prevention of work-related injury and illness. Part of that activity relates to the interstitial lung diseases, including pneumoconioses, as well as other occupational pulmonary diseases typically identified by examination of radiographic images (e.g., pleural abnormalities). The technology used for decades to image the lungs of workers for the early detection of these work-related diseases has been conventional film-screen chest radiographic imaging. Trained readers assess the chest radiographs for the presence and severity of lung parenchymal opacities and pleural changes, using a classification system developed by the International Labor Office (ILO). The ILO classification system was designed to systematically record the changes seen on standard film-screen chest radiographs as a result of dust inhalation, and requires the reader to compare any abnormalities observed on a worker's radiograph to a set of standard radiographs exemplifying dust diseases, currently provided as hard copy films by the ILO. In order to assure that trained readers are available, NIOSH maintains a "B Reader Program," which trains physicians to perform ILO classifications. B Readers are physicians who have passed an examination administered by NIOSH to document their competence in using the ILO classification system. NIOSH, through its B Reader program and research and monitoring activities using radiographic assessments, continues to have an extensive impact on national and international practices in workforce medical screening, research, hazard evaluations, clinical practice, compensation, and standard setting in occupational disease.</p>
<p>Increasingly, medical imaging and patient information systems are utilizing digital approaches to data acquisition, transmission, storage, display, and interpretation. Over the next decade, conventional radiography, including chest radiography, will be completely replaced by digital radiography systems in the United States. Because of this, NIOSH is in the process of adopting and facilitating the application of digital chest imaging systems in the recognition of occupational lung disorders within its own research and monitoring programs, as well as recommending and advising on the use of digital technologies in the identification and assessment of occupational lung disease both nationally and internationally.</p>
<p>The transition to digital radiography has led to the need to update and modify certain aspects of the radiographic screening program within NIOSH, and has similar implications for our national and international partners. A comprehensive digital image repository would provide essential material for critical activities relating to the digital transition within NIOSH and beyond, including B Reader training and testing, and the development of new digital standard reference images. In the longer term, such a repository could also provide the basis for implementing quality assurance programs in both internal and external reading exercises. Such quality assurance is critically needed, since without it, control of variability among readers is difficult. The introduction of digital radiography makes quality assurance considerably simpler than it was for film-based radiography. Moreover, since the advent of digital imaging provides the opportunity to research and explore new concepts and methodologies that take advantage of computer technology, the repository will provide the material for research studies in this area. These include digital processing to enhance the appearance of abnormalities as well as computer-assisted recognition of abnormalities.</p>
<p>Concept of Operations and Unique Characteristics of the repository:</p>
<p>1. Concept of Operations</p>
<p>&bull; NIOSH will advertize the repository to stakeholders, and, when useful and appropriate, solicit the submission of images from partners.<br />&bull; Whether a stakeholder independently offers images to NIOSH or NIOSH solicits images, discussions will be held by NIOSH to finalize details on the transfer.<br />&bull; When negotiations are complete, NIOSH will inform the repository manager of the transfer that is to take place.<br />&bull; The repository manager or designated staff will provide instructions on his/her website or contact the NIOSH stakeholder/partner directly to work through the transfer details for the image and associated relevant medical information, including verifying that the images are of required technical quality, stored in files of appropriate format, and fit established radiographic (DICOM) criteria, and that the medical information and consent forms have been completed and submitted. See appendix A for the requested medical information and appendix B for the consent form.<br />&bull; The repository manager or designated staff will provide the stakeholder/partner with a mechanism for transfer of images and associated relevant medical information, either via the internet using a secure pathway or using removable media. <br />&bull; The repository manager or designated staff will verify that the files, as described by the provider, arrive into the repository in a format as described and are as agreed. <br />&bull; If the submitted files contain protected health information (PHI), the repository manager or designated staff will assure all materials are anonymized prior to placing in the repository, using established criteria.<br />&bull; Each image file will be linked with the associated relevant medical information by a unique identifier and the linkage maintained in the database.<br />&bull; NIOSH should have continuous access to all data in the repository and be able to download any image file or set of files as required, including the linked medical information.<br />&bull; NIOSH will own the repository. Access to any materials in the repository will not be given to any third parties without authorization by NIOSH. All copies of files aside from any personal identifying information will be returned to NIOSH at the end of the contract, if no extension is granted.<br />&bull; The repository files should have physically separate duplicate systems and periodic back-up so that no image will be lost due to natural or human causes.</p>
<p>Programs:<br />The programs impacted by this procurement include 1) the NIOSH Coal Workers X-ray Surveillance Program (CWXSP), 2) the NIOSH B Reader training and certification program, 3) other NIOSH research or service programs that require the use of chest imaging (such as the NIOSH Health Hazard Evaluation Program), 4) any mandated or discretionary federal or non-federal programs requiring ILO classification of chest images, as in radiographic surveillance programs, 5) private and publicly-funded lung disease research activities.</p>
<p>NIOSH Programmatic Goals Relevant to the Procurement:<br />1. To provide the tools needed by NIOSH B Readers participating in the NIOSH CWXSP to use digital imaging for classification of chest images according to the ILO classification system. <br />2. To enable NIOSH research and surveillance programs to accept standard digital radiographic chest images and to assure the integrity, accuracy, confidentiality, and ongoing utility of these chest images for NIOSH programs.<br />3. To transition to the use of digital media all aspects of NIOSH training and competency testing programs for physicians who interpret chest radiographs for respiratory system changes due to occupational exposures (NIOSH B Reader Program) .</p>

<SUBJECT>Microimager for Autoradiography Experiments

<CONTACT>Gail  Akinbinu, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-496-0692, Fax 301-480-9826, Email gakinbinu@cc.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health Radiology & Imaging Sciences Department intends to procure an advanced autoradiography technology using real-time imaging and multilabeling patent owned by Biospace. These technologies will be used for applications in imaging rat brains using various tracers. This will be the pre-PET imaging applications for those unique stracers and fast acquistion of autoradiographic imagin becomes of utmost importance , as well as the real-time application as nobody knows yet the exposure time necessary for our study specimen.

This equipment is needed to start an autoradiography service for the Hammoud lab, which is a new lab dedicated to imaging of infectious diseases. Autoradiography will help determine the tissue distributions of inflammation and infection-associated receptors and cells both in vivo and in vitro. We have reviewed multiple other options for autoradiography however none of the other instruments can provide the following two characteristics: 1. Real-time acquisition of data which means that every disintegration will be seen, measured and listed in the image file with a number of criteria (time of occurrence, size, shape, brightness) allowing the discrimination of 2 to 3 different isotopes in the same experiment based on the difference of Energy or Decay. This opens the way to unlimited applications referred to as Multi-labeling. In addition, this systems characteristic allows fast and high resolution acquisition of the data, without the risk of over or under-exposure which can sometimes lead to failed studies and necessitate repeating the experiments. We hope this will result in a more accurate evaluation of the receptors, using a smaller number of animals. 2. Multi-labeling: This is a method of generating a plurality of images of a substrate from radioactive radiation coming from a plurality of radioactive tracers contained in the substrate. To this end, data representing the different detection signals generated by a detector are memorized, individually for each radioactive emission detected during a certain observation period, then statistical processing of these data is carried out in such a way as to estimate the images of the different tracers which correspond best to the set of memorized data. This will allow us to track more than one target in the same sample of animals. Biospace owns the patent for this technology. When compared to other systems, this system also provides higher resolution and faster acquisition times than phosphor imagers. The resolution using films is still better however this technique is becoming obsolete and soon there wont be any market for it. In addition, we do not have access to a dark room in order to process the films. For all these reasons, we believe the micro-imager fits our needs perfectly and we believe it will allow us to perform state-of-the-art autoradiography experiments.

<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD</p>
<p>A. GENERAL<br />The major evaluation factors for this solicitation include two parts which shall hold equal merit in determining best overall value to the Government. The two parts are as follows:</p>
<p>1) Technical Evaluation - which encompasses experience and past performance of demonstrating the ability to meet the specifications factors listed (see Section B below);</p>
<p>2) Cost/Price Evaluation proposal will be evaluated for realism and reasonableness.</p>
<p><br />B. TECHNICAL EVALUATION <br />Offerors proposals shall be evaluated on the criterion listed below and shall receive an overall rating of, Exceptional Acceptability; Acceptable or Unacceptable. Only proposals that are determined to be Acceptable shall be eligible and considered for award. The definition that will be used in evaluating and rating the criterion is as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Exceptional Acceptability: Equipment exceeds the specified performance or capabilities in a beneficial way has no major weaknesses or deficiencies.</p>
<p>&bull; Acceptable: Equipment meets specification standards and any weaknesses or deficiencies are considered minor and are readily correctable or acceptable in meeting the overall requirement.</p>
<p>&bull; Unacceptable: Equipment fails to meet the specification(s) and the weaknesses and/or deficiencies are considered uncorrectable without major revisions and would potentially subject the Government to overall risks in performance - either in time and/or money.</p>
<p><br />TECHNICAL FACTORS:</p>
<p>1) Programmable Logic Control (PLC) system with touch screen display, and 32-column alpha/numeric printer, and 30 sterilization cycles<br />2) Chamber size 56" wide, 62" tall, 120" deep<br />3) Gravity and Prevacuum cycle capability. (Cycles shall be able to be configured as gravity, glassware, liquids (open and vented containers), media, biobags, leak test in the temperature range of 105&deg; C to 138&deg; C)<br />4) Chamber and door construction: 316L stainless steel<br />5) 304 stainless steel jacket<br />6) A minimum of 25 Ra finish for chamber &amp; door <br />7) Sectional design for egress due to the loading dock elevator size and capacity (autoclave shall be brought into the facility in sections, welded, pressure tested and certified on site)<br />8) Shall accommodate existing six 23"W x 39"D x 58"H carts <br />9) Low profile jacket to minimize ramp height (the autoclave shall not require a pit to allow for the drainage of water from the equipment)<br />10) EnviroVac high vacuum system or equivalent design (allows operation of sterilizer at low water pressure installations (less than 25 psi water pressure). Water pressure fluctuations will not affect performance of the high vacuum system. Reduces total sterilizer water consumption to less than 8 GPM. Attains 28.5" hg. Includes condenser for reduction of discharge temperature to &lt; 130&deg; F)<br />11) Pneumatic piston valves<br />12) One automatic horizontal sliding door preferred<br />13) Smoke ventilators with hepa filters<br />14) Hydraulic lift or ramp for the loading/unloading of equipment/supplies in/out of the unit. <br />15) Meet facility height requirements (98.5 inches)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>COST/PRICE EVALUATION:</p>
<p>Offeror proposed price shall be evaluated on realism and reasonable for the Government to purchase the equipment.</p>
<p>For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the government that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to prices in the market. Normally, price reasonableness is established through adequate price competition, but may also be determined through cost and price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404.<br />Realism will be evaluated only on the offeror(s) inputs which the Government will use to determine the most probable cost/price for the equipment in a manner consistent with the offeror's proposal. Cost/Price realism analysis will be conducted in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(d). The result of the cost/price realism analysis will be considered in the making the best value tradeoff decision.</p>
<p>TRADEOFF-DECISION (SELECTION FOR AWARD):</p>
<p>Contract award shall be made to the responsible Offeror whose technical and price proposals, in conforming to this solicitation, provides an overall best value to the Government. The Government's objective is to obtain the highest technically accepted proposal at the most fair and reasonable proposed price. In selecting an offeror for award, offerors are instructed and advised that lowest price technically acceptable shall not automatically determine best overall value. Below is a table for information purposes to demonstrate the overall tradeoff process and an example that the Government may select higher technical acceptable proposal at a higher proposed price due to the overall value.</p>
<p>TRADE-OFF TABLE<br />Overall Technical Rating Proposed Price<br />Vendor A Unacceptable $80<br />Vendor B Acceptable $210<br />Vendor C Exceptionally Acceptable $225<br />Vendor D Acceptable $220<br /><br />In the example above, the Government could select Vendor C for award because overall best value is justified and supported that $225 is considered a fair and reasonable price for the purchase of the equipment. To select an Exceptional Offeror for $15 greater than the lowest-priced/technical acceptable is considered obtaining the highest quality of equipment for the proposed price. (Overall Exceptionally Acceptable would be a result of receiving 6 or more Exceptionally Acceptable ratings per criteria listed above).</p>
<p>The offeror must include a completed copy of the provision of FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with its offer. The provisions of FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items; FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items; FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; and FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items - Deviation for Simplified Acquisitions applies to this acquisition.

Unlisted classifications needed for work not included within the scope of the classifications listed may be added after award only as provided in the labor standards contract clauses (29CFR 5.5 (a) (1) (ii)). In the listing above, the "SU" designation means that rates listed under the identifier do not reflect collectively bargained wage and fringe benefit rates.  Other designations indicate unions whose rates have been determined to be prevailing.
                   WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS
1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can be:
*  an existing published wage determination*  a survey underlying a wage determination*  a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on   a wage determination matter*  a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling
On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.) and 3.) should be followed.
With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal process described here, initial contact should be with the Branch of Construction Wage Determinations.  Write to:
	Branch of Construction Wage Determinations	Wage and Hour Division	U.S. Department of Labor	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.	Washington, DC 20210
2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an interested party (those affected by the action) can request review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator (See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:
	Wage and Hour Administrator	U.S. Department of Labor	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.	Washington, DC 20210
The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the interested party's position and by any information (wage payment data, project description, area practice material, etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.
3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board).  Write to:
	Administrative Review Board	U.S. Department of Labor	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.	Washington, DC 20210
4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.

<a href="mailto:zbuss@usgs.gov">zbuss@usgs.gov</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) intends to award a brand name sole source fixed-price purchase order under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)), Simplified Acquisition Procedures for a HOBO Remote Monitoring System. We have a requirement for a number of different components that encompass the HOBO Remote Monitoring System.
We need multiple weather stations that have the capacity to measure and record soil moisture, relative humidity, solar radiation, rainfall, barometric pressure, as well as multiple temperatures, including air and soil temperature at various heights above and below the ground. Each weather station must have built in wireless communications through GSM cellular networks to online servers that are maintained by the weather station vendor. In addition, each weather station must have USB connectivity for downloading data to handheld storage devices, and must have local data storage memory of at least 512 K bytes. Each system should be able to log data on at least 15 channels at five-second intervals. Each system must be easily reconfigurable with plug and play style sensors so that any sensor can be swapped out for a different parameter without any reprogramming needed.
The HOBO Remote Monitoring System is a remote data logging and monitoring device with built in cellular communications that can be easily reconfigured and adapted to measure a wide variety of applications to measure climate. Up to 15 channels of data can be recorded and monitored remotely via Onset's web-enabled software platform, HOBOlink. All of the additional components listed provide the ability to measure specific parameters such as soil moisture, relative humidity, solar radiation, rainfall, temperature, barometric pressure, etc. 
The HOBO Remote Monitoring System unit has the capabilities, data logging storage capacity, and remote data upload to perform at the level desired for this field work. Due to the nature of the study, it is extremely important that there be consistency in the method in which our data is collected. The use of a system made by the same manufacturer is imperative for data integrity and comparison. Using different brand weather stations would make the data collected inconsistent with each other, jeopardizing the entire project.
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is G11PS00667 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in affect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-53, effective 05 July 2011. 
This requirement is subject to the information in the attached Instructions, Requirements, and Clauses. As well, see solicitation RFQ Standard Form 18 with list of the Contract Line Items. Delivery date to Henderson, NV 89074  is 01 November 2011.  The Government anticipates award of a commercial, Firm-Fixed Price type contract.  All firms must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at www.ccr.gov, as well as, the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) to be considered for award.  Please contact the Contract Specialist, in writing, by email at zbuss@usgs.gov, with any questions. Questions are due no later than 5:00pm PST on 20 July 2011.
This requirement is unrestricted business size.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334519, Other Measuring and Controlling Device Manufacturing  Size Standard for Small Business is 500 employees.

Please ensure completion prior to submission of your quote. Also note that paragraph (b) of FAR 52.204-8, applies.</p>
<p>Justification for Other Than Full And Open Competition (JOTFOC)</p>
<p>Pursuant to the requirement of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) as implemented by FAR Subpart 6.3, HSAR 3006.3, HSAM 3006.3, HSAM, CGAP 1206.3, and in accordance with (IAW) requirements of FAR 6.303-1, the justification for the use of the statutory authority under FAR Subpart 6.302-1 is justified by the following facts and rationale require under FAR 6.303-2 as follows:</p>
<p>1. Agency and contracting activity: The Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Coast Guard Command, Control and Communications Engineering Center (C3CEN).</p>
<p>2. Nature/description of the action being approved: The U.S. Coast Guard C3CEN Electronics Repair Facility (ERF) has a requirement, on a sole source basis, for the purchase of electronic repair and replacement parts to be used in centralized depot repair of U.S. Coast Guard Aids to Navigation (AtoN) Equipment, specifically the VM-100 Fog Detector Assembly.</p>
<p>3. Description of supplies/services: A Purchase Request will be issued for the purchase of: fifteen (15) each, Detector Assembly for VM-100, PN: FD1002650; manufactured by Fidelity Technologies Corporation, the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). The parts requested are exact replacements to be used in the repair of the VM-100 Fog Detector Assembly.</p>
<p>4. Identification of the justification and the rationale: This statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) implemented by FAR Subpart 6.302-1, entitled "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".</p>
<p>5. Demonstration that the nature of the acquisition requires use of authority cited: The OEM specifications for these items are proprietary commercial property. The Coast Guard did not purchase this information when VM-100 Fog Detector Assemblies were originally purchased. Fidelity Technologies Corporation originally manufactured the Detector Assembly contained on the VM-100 Fog Detector Assembly. Adequate item information, documentation, and specifications are not available to develop an appropriate purchase description for full and open competition. Fidelity Technologies Corporation is the only known provider meeting system requirements for form, fit, function, configuration, records, and integration with the VM-100 Fog Detector Assemblies. Any variances could cause catastrophic negative impact on the reliability of sound and visual signals essential to safe navigation of U.S. waterways.</p>
<p>6. Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable: In accordance with FAR Subpart 5.2, in an effort to solicit as many potential sources as practical, a RFQ will be posted on FEDBIZOPS.</p>
<p>7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable: The Contracting Officer will determine fair and reasonableness based on previous purchases.</p>
<p>8. Description of Market Research: Market research as prescribed in FAR Part 10 was conducted by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative. The Internet was searched using part numbers and item names for a list of manufacturers/vendors that could provide time delay relays and flasher modules; several companies were contacted and no one could meet the OEM specification. The market research showed that only Fidelity Technologies Corporation could provide replacement parts that meet the minimum technical specifications to ensure compatibility with existing electronic and mechanical circuitry and to ensure that safe operational parameters are maintained.</p>
<p>9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition: The material technical specifications and supplementary data are proprietary to the OEM and cannot be provided to other manufacturers, which eliminates any opportunities for full and open competition. The U.S. Coast Guard is required by law to maintain a failsafe system in the execution and control of visual and audio aids to navigation. Without such systems, maintained by these specific parts, there would be a negative impact on the reliability of sound and visual signals essential to safe navigation of U.S. waterways.</p>
<p>10. Listing of sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: No sources expressed an interest in this solicitation.</p>
<p>11. Statement of actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisitions for supplies or services required: Recommend no actions be taken at this time to overcome barriers barring full and open competition.</p>
<p>12. Contracting Officer's Certification: I certify that this requirement meets the Government's minimum need and that the supporting data, which forms a basis for this justification, is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.</p>

<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Additional clauses/provisions in full text)<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<CONTACT>Lance Butler III, Email lbutler@usaid.gov
<DESC>The Office of Food for Peace (FFP) in the U.S. Agency for International Development's Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) provides grants for food assistance to private voluntary organizations (PVOs) and the UN World Food Program (WFP). FFP provides both emergency food aid (which aims to address food aid needs arising from natural disasters, such as floods or droughts, and complex emergencies often characterized by insecurity and population displacement) and nonemergency food aid (which aims to address the underlying causes of chronic food insecurity). The Office seeks a Program Team Leader to develop and improve the solicitation and program guidance specific to the Office of Food for Peace's IDA-funded Emergency Food Security Program. The PSC will facilitate the receipt and review of proposals under the program and oversee the implementation of emergency food assistance grants awarded under the program.

The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>Question 1 - Is this a first-time meeting?  If not, share past year history (2009-2010 dates, location and pick up)

Include make and model of items quoted.
See attached list of items.
1. Does the equipment need to meet certain standards; such as NASP A: The equipment needs to meet the minimum criteria as listed2. Is it being used for the Archery in the School ProgramA: No, the equipment is not being used for the Archery in the schools program, however it will be used in a similar type program being used by youth to adult age to introduce archery and archery programs.3. For the bows?high end, middle of the road or low end bow?.what type of equipment so we can quote apples to apples A: Bows should meet or exceed the equipment requirements as posted. Award will be made to the offeror who's bid represents the best value for the Government.  Quality of equipment, technical capability, and price will all be factors considered in determining award.4. Targets ? do they want paper targets, targets with a thickness so the arrow can land in the target; do they require a stand. Please advise so we can quote correctly. A: Targets shall be a Minimum 33" indoor/outdoor Target w/ 80cm face, Target shall be freestanding or to include a stand. Target must be capable, at minimum, of stopping arrows shot from the type of bows listed in the response.5. Item #10 on the purchase list is a "48" X 19" X 12" Hard case to accomodate 12 bows, arrows, arm guards." We think perhaps this is a typo as we cannot locate any such product. Moreover, it would be unrealistic to expect 12 bows to go into those listed dimensions. Did the client mean ".. to accodate 1 or 2 bows ..."? If not, can you provide the manufacture's name for the case with the original specification. A: The dimensions and description on the item list are correct.  It is not required the case be an archery case, just that it be a hard case measuring 48" X 19" X 12" suitable to fit the equipment as described.
Clarifications posted 11 July, 2011:     a.  In reference to requested finger guards installed:  Finger tabs will be an acceptable alternative to installed finger guards if supplied in sufficient sizes and quatities.       b.  In reference to the requested hard case:  Case dimensions should as close to those listed in Buy Attachment 002 "archery kit item list".  It must accomodate at one time all twelve bows, twelve armguards, and 6 dozen arrows.  It is not required to be an "archery case".

A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge.

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government. 

Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities. 

Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. 

Registered in the CCR database means that 

(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and 

(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record Active. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process. 

(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. 

(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation DUNS or DUNS +4 followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offerors name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. 

(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. 

(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number 

(i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or 

(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. 

(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information: 

(i) Company legal business. 

(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized. 

(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and ZIP Code. 

(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and ZIP Code (if separate from physical). 

(v) Company Telephone Number.

(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity). 

(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. 

(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. 

(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Governments reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 

(1) 

(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business days written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. 

(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. 

(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractors CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 

(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR HAYABUSACLEANROOM.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This noticeserves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will notbe issued.The purpose of this amendment is to provide questions received from industry.The due date for receipt of offers is not extended.Q1: Will there be a bid package on this forthcoming or is the Statement of Work providedto be used as the bid documents?A1: Prospective offerors are required to submit an offer based on the statement of workprovided in the synopsis solicitation. Offerors are encouraged to use standard form 1449,Solicitation/Contract/Order for Commercial Items form found at URL:http://server-mpo.arc.nasa.gov/Services/NEFS/NEFSHome.tml    . The statement of workshall not be used as a bid document but used as a reference to formulate the offerorsquote.Q2: Would you be opposed to just epoxy painting the existing walls that will be exposedto the air path in lieu of cladding them. I personally have used this technic verysuccessful all over the world in all types of clean room classifications including class10. The epoxy will encapsulate the existing wall and the air stream will remain clean.You will still get the class 10 for a very long time at less first cost to the project.A2:  Yes, the Government would be opposed to epoxy painting the existing walls becausethe existing walls are covered with vinyl clean room wall covering and prefer not topaint over the existing wall covering.Q3: Regarding the existing ceiling in Room 1106: If it is a hard, painted gypsum boardceiling I suggest the same this as the walls; encapsulate the existing ceiling with 2coats of epoxy paint. If the ceiling is an existing acoustical type lay-in ceiling, wouldyou be opposed to just replacing the ceiling tiles with vinyl faced gypsum board, cleanroom rated tiles? This will save first cost money also and not be a detriment to theproject. A3: The existing ceiling is painted gypsum.  The statement of work does not require theepoxy paint for the ceiling but the epoxy paint is acceptable.	Q4: In the SOW Section 7.2, I had a question about cladding the air path.  As stated inthe SOW the existing wall exposed to the air path are to be cladded with  aluminumpanels. Does this include the ceiling of the existing room also? If so, what is theexisting ceiling made of?A4: Based on the requirements stated in section 7.2 of the statement of work, cladding isnot included for the ceiling of the existing room.   The existing ceiling is paintedgypsum.  Q5: Section 7.2 also: Do you want the transparent viewing walls to be glass from floorto ceiling or from 4 above finished floor to ceiling?A 5: Based on section 7.2 of the statement of work, the transparent viewing walls arerequired and the Government prefer the 4 above the finished floor to the ceiling.Q6: How much if any of the electrical wiring would you want us to do? Statement 10.2 saysthat the power wiring will be done in-house. Is this all the wiring or just from acertain point? Please define.A6: Based on section 10.2 of the statement of work, all the power for blowers andlighting will be furnished by in-house workforce.Q7: The synopsis/solicitation has a clean room delivery date stated September 6, 2011 andthe statement of work has a delivery date stated October 1, 2011.  What is the correctclean room delivery date? A7: The correct delivery date for the clean room is September 6, 2011.Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASAAcquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on June 28, 2011.

The technical quotation shall address the following: <br /><br />Technical Capability: The offeror shall submit a technical description or product literature for the equipment it is proposing, which clearly identifies the manufacturer, make and model. The offeror must demonstrate that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds each minimum requirement described in the technical specifications by providing a citation to the relevant section of its technical description or product literature. If applicable, evidence that the Offeror is authorized by the original equipment manufacturer to provide the item(s) in the quotation should be included.</p>
<p>Past Performance: The offeror shall provide past performance information regarding relevant contracts over the past five (5) years with Federal, state, or local governments, or commercial customers. If the offeror has no relevant past performance, it may include a statement to that effect in its quotation. The government reserves the right to consider data obtained from sources other than those described by the offeror in its quotation. It is recommended that approximately 3-5 contracts be referenced.</p>

<p><strong>QUOTATION EVALUATION:</strong></p>
<p>Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Past Performance, and 3) Price. All non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equally important to price.</p>
<p>Technical Capability: No prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will be considered. Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award. If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NIST's requirements.</p>
<p>Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>
<p>Price: The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness.</p>
<p>Past Performance and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.</p>

<SUBJECT>Microimager for Autoradiography Experiments

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health Radiology & Imaging Sciences Department intends to procure an advanced autoradiography technology using real-time imaging and multilabeling patent owned by Biospace. These technologies will be used for applications in imaging rat brains using various tracers. This will be the pre-PET imaging applications for those unique stracers and fast acquistion of autoradiographic imagin becomes of utmost importance , as well as the real-time application as nobody knows yet the exposure time necessary for our study specimen.

This equipment is needed to start an autoradiography service for the Hammoud lab, which is a new lab dedicated to imaging of infectious diseases. Autoradiography will help determine the tissue distributions of inflammation and infection-associated receptors and cells both in vivo and in vitro. We have reviewed multiple other options for autoradiography however none of the other instruments can provide the following two characteristics: 1. Real-time acquisition of data which means that every disintegration will be seen, measured and listed in the image file with a number of criteria (time of occurrence, size, shape, brightness) allowing the discrimination of 2 to 3 different isotopes in the same experiment based on the difference of Energy or Decay. This opens the way to unlimited applications referred to as Multi-labeling. In addition, this systems characteristic allows fast and high resolution acquisition of the data, without the risk of over or under-exposure which can sometimes lead to failed studies and necessitate repeating the experiments. We hope this will result in a more accurate evaluation of the receptors, using a smaller number of animals. 2. Multi-labeling: This is a method of generating a plurality of images of a substrate from radioactive radiation coming from a plurality of radioactive tracers contained in the substrate. To this end, data representing the different detection signals generated by a detector are memorized, individually for each radioactive emission detected during a certain observation period, then statistical processing of these data is carried out in such a way as to estimate the images of the different tracers which correspond best to the set of memorized data. This will allow us to track more than one target in the same sample of animals. Biospace owns the patent for this technology. When compared to other systems, this system also provides higher resolution and faster acquisition times than phosphor imagers. The resolution using films is still better however this technique is becoming obsolete and soon there wont be any market for it. In addition, we do not have access to a dark room in order to process the films. For all these reasons, we believe the micro-imager fits our needs perfectly and we believe it will allow us to perform state-of-the-art autoradiography experiments.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
It is imperative that the equipment meet the following evaluation criteria based on the weighted percentage of each of the below-listed criteria:

1.	(33 %) Must be able to detect the following radioisotopes: Hydrogen-3, Carbon-14, Carbon-11, Phosphorous-33, Phosphorus-32, Sulfur-35, Iodine-131, Iodine-125, Iodine-124, Iodine-123, Oxygen-15, Fluorine-18, Technicium-99m, Indium-111, Thallium-201. 

2.	(66 %) Simultaneous imaging and discrimination of multiple radioisotope emitters if their respective half-lives are equal to or greater than a factor of 2.



The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 339112, Size Standard - 500 employees.

Vendors must submit quotes to Gail Akinbinu at the following email address: gakinbinu@cc.nih.gov. Please submit documentation no later than July 21,2011at 12:00pm

The Private Provider Network (PPN) service requests will include medical surveillance exams, pre-placement physicals, collection of various laboratory specimens, immunizations, annual medical screenings, post-exposure exams, phlebotomy services, and blood pressure checks, in addition to a variety of additional health and wellness procedures and examinations. More than 16,000 exams and over 80,000 additional OH services were completed by the FOH PPN last year.</p>
<p>The PPN will require one centralized location to manage the process of receiving the services requests, assigning the private provider to be used, collecting the results and making the medical record, quality review of the service and results, scheduling of certain exams and shipping of the completed medical record to the designated location. This centralized location will store all the medical records for the FOH PPN program and will retrieve records and ship to designated location as requested. The system for communicating and managing the network will be a contractor-provided online secured web-based portal where information on status and results will be available to designated FOH staff. <br />The PPN supports FOH's mission and objectives to improve the health and safety of the government workforce. This PPN will enhance the reach of FOH programs offered to its interagency partners by providing FOH's services in remote areas where FOH does not have an Occupational Health Clinic. The PPN will support FOH's ability to provide high quality occupational health medical services to the Federal government. <br />This Statement of Work specifies the requirements for the FOH Private Provider Network program, tasked with delivering a defined scope of health and wellness services at private clinics in all 50 of the Continental United States (CONUS)in Guam, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, and Alaska), (OCONUS), and international services in Canada. The contractor will be required to have or engage the providers needed to fulfill this contract.

More than 16,000 exams and over 80,000 additional OH services were completed by FOH PPN in 2009 through one national network provided by the incumbent contractor. FOH PPN service requests have included medical surveillance exams, pre-placement physicals, collection of various laboratory specimens, immunizations, annual medical screenings, post-exposure exams, phlebotomy services, and blood pressure checks, in addition to a variety of additional health and wellness procedures and examinations. <br />17.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The contract will be for a base year plus 4 option years. The contract is anticipated to be issued under the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Part 15 Contracting by Negotiation and it will be a fixed price requirements contract with Labor Hour and Cost Reimbursement line items. The Navy intends to extend the performance under the current contract with the incumbent, L-3 Communications, through 30 Jun 2012.

<DESC><strong>AMENDMENT 12 <br /></strong><br /><strong>A. &nbsp;Background </strong>
<p><strong>NRC has implemented a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software product, CGI's Momentum&reg; (hereafter referred to as "Momentum&reg;") for its Core Financial System (CFS), known at the NRC as the FAIMIS CFS. The FAIMIS CFS includes the following modules: Budget Execution, Purchasing, Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Purchase Card, General Ledger, Travel Accounting, Fixed Assets, License Fee Billing, and Cost Accounting.</strong></p>
<p><strong>On December 28, 2010, NRC issued Solicitation No. NRC-HQ-11-R-09-0013 for the purchase of a commercial item acquisition system and licenses, and the implementation and integration of the proposed acquisition system into CGI's Momentum&reg; federal financial management solution, NRC's FAIMIS CFS. In the solicitation, the NRC required that offerors host their acquisition system with the NRC's CFS at DOI/NBC located in Denver, CO. Additionally, the solicitation required that the contractor work with the hosting entity, DOI/NBC, in support of the transition from the NRC to the hosting facility. The solicitation closed on February 21, 2011.</strong></p>
<p><strong>On April 27, 2011, NRC was informed that the anticipated hosting site for the acquisition system, DOI/NBC, would not be available for future hosting. This development impacted the acquisition system solicitation because the NRC will now need an alternative hosting solution for both the FAIMIS CFS as well as the yet-to-be-procured acquisition system.</strong></p>
<p><strong>B. Purpose<br /><br />The purpose of this amendment is to revise the solicitation to reflect NRC's current needs based on the recently indentified changes to the hosting requirement. This amendment adds the hosting requirement for the acquisition system only; hosting for the FAIMIS CFS will not be procured via this solicitation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The NRC performed extensive market research and could not identify two or more small businesses that demonstrate appropriate capability to satisfy solicitation requirements, including the new hosting requirements. Therefore, NRC is continuing a full and open competitive solicitation for this acquisition.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This solicitation is open to all interested parties. Offerors that previously submitted proposals may submit revised proposals to reflect this amendment. The government prefers that all updated proposals be submitted with track changes.</strong></p>

<DESC>The solicitation number has been amended to:&nbsp; HSTS02-11-R-CGO027<br /><br />The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to release a solicitation to upgrade to the web based version of the Alion CM tool to the incumbent contractor, Alion Science and Technology Corporation, 1759 Tysons Blvd., Suite 1300, McLean, VA 22102. The proposed contract action will provide&nbsp;an upgrade to Air Cargo's current version of the commercial off the shelf (COTS) product CounterMeasures Software, which provides technical integration with other TSA branches that use the CounterMeasures Software, report engineering services, data management services, and project management support.&nbsp; The upgrade will improve data sharing between TSA branches that utilize this software and will enable an enterprise version of CounterMeasures with Multi-Modal modules to be housed on the Transportation Operating Platform (TOP).
<p>A non-competititve contract action is required because the software tool, CounterMeasures, is a licensed product and Alion Science &amp; Technology is the exclusive developer with sole data development rights. It would not be cost effective in terms of time, cost, and effort for TSA to acquire a separate contract to provide/replace the currently utilized software. The period of performance for this sole-source contract will be for 12 months (base year) from the date of award with four one(1) year options.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Government.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">A firm fixed price contract was not selected, since it is not possible to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This effort is to provide services for 3 posts at the Lafayette Building, located 811 Vermont Ave. NW, Washington, D.C.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The agency has anticipated this project to start on 09/15/2010, but due to unanticipated contractor delays the project's start date was pushed back to 10/06/2010. Future unforeseeable delays could also impact the hours these guards will need to work during this construction project. In addition, due to possible schedule constraints, the agency anticipated that construction contractor may have to be to perform some construction work during evening hours or at other times which are outside of the normal post working hours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The agency estimates that this could occur up to 20% of the time. This makes predicting the hours needed for the future difficult to predict at this time. </span></p>

<DESC>The protocol and audit program performance requested under this contract shall assist OCR in operating an audit program that effectively implements the statutory requirement to audit covered entity and business associate compliance with the HIPAA privacy and security standards as amended by ARRA. The audits shall be conducted through a contracted firm(s) under the guidance of HHS staff.
<p>After developing the audit protocol the contractor will be required to meet entities and perform the following audit activities:</p>
<p>Site visits conducted as part of every audit would include interviews with leadership (e.g., CIO, Privacy Officer, legal counsel, health information management/medical records director); examination of physical features and operations; consistency of process to policy, observation of compliance with regulatory requirements</p>
<p>After each site visit the contractor must submit an audit report. Audit reports consist of the following information:</p>
<p>a timeline and methodology of the audit; best practices noted; raw data collection materials such as completed checklists and interview notes; a certification indicating the audit is complete. The report must include specific recommendations for actions the audited entity can take to address identified compliance problems through a corrective action plan. The report must include recommendations to the COTR regarding continued need for corrective action, if any, and description of future oversight recommendations. Final Reports shall include, at minimum:<br />&bull; Identification and description of the audited entity: Include, full name, address, EIN, contact person.<br />&bull; Methods used to conduct the audit<br />&bull; For each finding:<br />o Condition: the defect or noncompliant status observed, and evidence of each<br />o Criteria: a clear demonstration that each negative finding is a potential violation of the Privacy or Security Rules, with citation<br />o Cause: The reason that the condition exists, along with identification of supporting documentation used <br />o Effect: the risk or noncompliant status that results from the finding <br />o Recommendations for addressing each finding <br />o Entity corrective actions taken, if any <br />&bull; Acknowledgement of any best practice(s) or success(es).<br />&bull; Overall conclusion paragraph</p>
<p>The nature of this work makes it impossible to anticipate the level of effort needed for each audit. The government anticipates completing 150 audits of entities varying in size and scope. The first part of this requirement which consists of developing the audit protocols is firm fixed price. The second portion of the requirement is also firm fixed price however due to vary nature each conducting each audit, the implementation portion of this requirement cannot be defined in manner to enable a firm fixed price methodology.</p>
