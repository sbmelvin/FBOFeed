<DESC>SYNOPSIS:

This is to update the Presolicitation Notice for Solicitation No. VA101-13-R-0059, hereby changing the solicitation number to VA101-13-R-0059A.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Construction and Facilities Management, Western Regional Contracting Office, Mare Island, CA is seeking a general construction contractor for construction associated with the VA Puget Sound Healthcare System, Seattle Division, Washington, Project 663-405A, Building 101 Mental Health Services - Phase 1 | Parking Structure and Main Entry Drive.  The contractor shall completely prepare the site for building operations, including demolition and removal of existing structures, and furnish labor and materials and perform work as required by the drawings and specifications.

This project, Phase 1 of the Building 101 Mental Health Services Seismic Renovation and Construction project, consists of the construction of the Main Entry Drive and a 1,000-space Parking Structure at the VA Puget Sound Health Care System/Seattle Division campus.
The scope of work will include construction of a new multi-level 1,000 car parking structure consisting of approximately 343,000 SF aboveground and 66,000 SF underground.  The underground portion will include ventilation systems, lighting, emergency power and elevators. Elevators will also be included at two locations in the aboveground portion of the garage. Phase 1 work also consists of the relocation of major underground utility systems, extensive civil grading and retaining-wall work as well as construction of an emergency power duct bank. The Entry Drive work includes grading, realignment and widening of the campus entry drive and walkways that serve the main hospital, a new garage and the provisions for temporary access routes for emergency vehicles during construction. 


BACKGROUND:

The VA Puget Sound HCS/Seattle Division is located in an area of high seismic activity.  The Puget Sound Area has experienced 25 damaging earthquakes since the late 1800s, and a 6.0 or greater earthquake is predicted for the region every 10 years.  A VA-contracted risk assessment indicated that many of the VAPSHCS buildings are at risk of collapse during a design-level earthquake of 6.7 or greater. In 2001, the VA initiated the Capital Assets Realignment for Enhanced Services (CARES) program.  This program required a 100-percent inventory of VHA's capital assets and the development of a long-range plan to address program gaps.  The seismic vulnerability and other infrastructure deficiencies of the VAPSHCS were also cited. There have been no major construction projects at the Seattle Division campus related to mental health in over 11 years; yet over the same period the number of Veterans seen in outpatient mental health clinics increased by 39 percent. All mental health and research space is currently fully occupied and does not meet current needs or future workload projections. VAPSHCS has been cited as having a severe shortage of space and that many of the laboratories were in need of major renovation or replacement.  The additional square footage provided by the construction of the new Building 101 will address the CARES identified square footage shortfall, allow for the consolidation of mental health clinics, administration and research space to facilitate more effective utilization of resources, double the amount of dedicated clinical research space, and provides additional square footage of laboratory space and associated office space to meet current deficiencies.



The project includes all necessary Construction and Demolition work associated with the performance of the Parking Garage and Entry Drive portion of the Building 101 Mental Health Services project.  Such work includes temporary provisions, demolition, traffic controls, shoring, utility work, paving, excavation and general construction-involving various disciplines of work to include but not limited to:  Architectural, Mechanical, Electrical, Fire Protection, Civil, Structural, Masonry, Roads and Landscape.  The project will be phased as indicated in the drawings and specification .  Existing Medical Center functions are to remain fully operational during construction of the parking structure, except as noted during the entry drive/underground portion of the garage work.  Contractor shall provide all tools, materials, equipment, transportation, supervision and labor for the work as indicated and specified to complete the project in the best interest of the government.  All work shall be accomplished in compliance with applicable local, state and federal codes, VA specification and drawings.


The estimated cost range for this project is between $50,000,000 and $100,000,000.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 236220 with a small business size standard of $33.5 million. This solicitation is full and open competition/unrestricted.


Solicitation documents will be posted at www.fbo.gov on or about July 26, 2013.  Construction contractors must download all solicitation (plans & specifications) documents at www.fbo.gov. Contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database at https://www.sam.gov prior to award and must have a DUNS number by registering for the Register to Receive Notification list at http://www.fbo.gov. Contractors will be notified by e-mail of any new amendments that have been issued and posted.  No other notification of amendments will be provided.  Contractors are advised that they are responsible for obtaining and acknowledging any amendments to the solicitation.  Check www.fbo.gov for all amendments BEFORE you deliver/send your proposal to the designated person, place, date and time.  


A Pre-Proposal Conference and a Small Business Workshop are tentatively scheduled for August 21, 2013 (specific time and location TBD) at the VA Puget Sound Healthcare System, Seattle Division, 1660 South Columbian Way, Seattle, Washington 98108.  All prospective bidders, consultants, subcontractors, equipment and material suppliers, are invited.
