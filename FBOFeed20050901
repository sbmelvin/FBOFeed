The Arbin proprietary software is the sole basis for our present internally-formulated testing protocols which rely on the Arbin's inherent safety features.  The utilization of the same proprietary data acquisition and analysis software and hardware that is presently being used affords the efficient comparison of data and ease of operation between the intruments.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 15, 2005.

<DESC>The VAMC Miami Research Service has a requirement for a performance based service contract (PBSC) for information technology support. Statement of Work 1.  Introduction, overview, or background The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) oversees thousands of research projects performed at VA medical centers (VAMCs) every year.  The research project management process covers the entire life cycle for projects, starting with the issuance of request for proposals (RFP) by the ORD, to proposal submission and review, to notification of funding decisions, to management of funded projects.  In addition, this process includes committee management, compliance management and performance tracking. The VA relies on a variety of methods and tools to perform these tasks, many of which vary throughout the four ORD services.  These four services include: a. Biomedical Laboratory Research and Development (BLR&D). b. Clinical Science Research and Development (CSR&D). c. Health Service Research and Development (HSR&D). d. Rehabilitation Research and Development (RR&D). Numerous systems currently support these processes, although many support only a limited number of programs or offices.  The system in use, many of which operate on aging platforms, vary significantly between ORD research services and the local research offices.  Over the past several years, the VA has conducted several studies to identify specific requirements and the best options for upgrading these systems to alleviate inadequacies.  Until these plans are put into action, ORD will continue to use the current collection of systems; therefore, adequate management, maintenance, and enhancement services will need to be sustained. 2.  OBJECTIVE The intent of the contract is to obtain central Automated Data Processing (ADP) preventive and remedial database/software/hardware maintenance services at the RDCC. The objective is: a. To significantly enhance existing functionality and usefulness (generally these enhancements are in response to requests made by Research and Development customers). b. To contribute to the product’s ease-of-use and aesthetic qualities. c. To incrementally improve the product’s robustness from update to update.  This includes the repair of potential problem-causing anomalies not yet encountered by customers. D. to plan, design, enhance, implement and maintain all server/network application projects for RDCC and ORD. e. In order to perform the above mentioned objectives successfully, recommended knowledge areas should include: project management, database administration, business/system analysis, documentation specialist, reporting specialist, end-user support and network administration. 3.  SCOPE VA ORD is currently seeking a vendor to manage, maintain, and enhance the numerous software applications supporting current local/national operations and the network they reside on.  The service support will affect the four research and development services under the Office of Research and Development, as well as the individual field-based local research offices supporting the research and development work of the VA. The Research and Development Computing Center (RDCC) Network is located on the 4th floor of the Research and Development Office at 103 S. Gay Street, in Baltimore, Maryland 21202. The RDCC operates an Ethernet LAN running at 100 Mbps.  In addition to supporting the resident staff, this network contains a number of significant components. 4.  PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS During the life of the contract verify conformance with ORD information processing standards and functional requirements.  Prior to delivery of modified/enhanced software/database, demonstrate the operational capability of the system software. Newly modified/enhanced software/database shall not adversely affect system performance.  New releases of software must maintain previously provided functionality while providing enhanced capabilities or system corrections. For software conversion projects, provide an inventory of programs, database and a description of the complexity of the existing systems and programs for transfer to another processing system or hardware and software platform operational environment including but not limited to database, files, programs, lines of code, and interdependencies.

<DESC>SUBJECT:  SEVEN PTTC MICROHOLE INTEGRATION METTINGS DESC:  The U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA intends to award a purchase order on a sole-source basis to Petroleum Technology Transfer Company, Houston, TX to Engineer, Integrate Seven PTTC Microhole Integration Meetings being request by our site  U.S. Department of Energy, National Petroleum Technology Office, Williams Center Tower One, One West Third St, Suite 1400, Tulsa, OK 74103-3519.  Statement of Work Petroleum Technology Transfer Council Microhole Technology (MHT) Integration Initiative The goal of this Statement of Work is to integrate information/efforts between DOE's Round 1 and 2 project performers and to integrate other MHT development efforts being pursued by industry. Implementing the MHT Integration Initiative quickly is critical because DOE's Round 1 projects are now providing results and Round 2 awards have now been placed. The key is helping industry ensure that the individual technologies will work together in an effective MHT system. Key elements of the Integration Initiative are: (1) integration meetings, (2) a state-of-the industry profile of MHT, and (3) developing and maintaining a web information/communication system. Developing, expanding and maintaining a contact/interested party database is an essential element underlying all tasks. Integration Meetings are proposed to reach all interested partners. Meeting objectives are to facilitate communication, partnering, and integration of technologies as they are being developed.  To stimulate interest and build participation, there will first be monthly meetings initially, and then quarterly meetings.  There will be a total of seven meetings. Task 1 Database preparation and maintenance. Prepare, expand and maintain a database of industry contacts with MHT interests. PTTC will contact known participants, identify potential participants and encourage industry partners to take part in teaming opportunities, as well as inform them of the Integration Initiative. Task 2 Facilitate Integration Meetings. Propose seven meetings for the next year. The first meeting would be projected for June 29, followed by July, August, September, then quarterly meetings in January, April, and July of 2006. PTTC is responsible for logistics, promotion, meeting facilitation, and documentation of meeting results (on web). Task 3 Technology Update for MHT - Develop a state-of-the-industry profile of MHT, pulling information from DOE's MHT program and industry efforts >> Define the domain of what is considered MHT?

<DESC>SUBJECT:  PORTABLE CAVITY RINGDWON SPECTROMETER DESC:  The U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA intends to award a purchase order on a sole-source basis to DIAL Laboratory, Starksville, MS for the purchase for a Portable Cavity Ringdown Spectrometer.  The following specifications are required: Portable cavity Ringdown spectrometer that is battery powered and rugged enough to handle transportation and handling in the field.  It also must be small and light enough to be readily carried in the field by a single operator.  The instrument must be able to continuously measure CO2 concentrations in the range between 300 and 2500 ppm and methane in the range between 0.25 and 25 ppm in a gas stream that is primarily composed of air.  Precision for methane detection must be sufficient so that the user may confidently tell the difference between 0.5 ppm and 1.0 ppm of methane.  Also, the instrument must be able to measure stable carbon isotope ratios in co2.  the precision must be at least 1 per mil in the delta 13c value. This purchase order is being issued to DIAL Laboratory because the measurements of methane flux and CO2 stable isotopes in real time in the field is critical to NETLâ€™s monitoring program for geologic sequestration.  The current state of the are procedure, which includes field sampling followed by laboratory analysis has proved to be insufficiently reliable in previous field projects. Cavity Ringdown spectroscopy is the only known technique that can achieve the sensitivity required for such measurements.  The instrument must be portable to facilitate field measurements in real time.  No other supplier is capable of producing a cavity Ringdown spectrometer that is field portable and battery powered and meets the required specifications.  DIAL Laboratory has designed and patented the instrument.  There is no know instrument available with similar capabilities.

All of this work and the apparatus associated with it is complex and will have to be designed to be assimilated into the current and extraordinarily complex high temperature combustion furnace infrastructure.  Not only will the system have to be designed to fit the current infrastructure while maintaining full operational capabilities of the aforementioned existing research equipment, but the burner systems will have to be modeled using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and the components will have to be procured from a number of dissimilar sources and carefully engineered to fit both the existing and the new system.  Because of the research nature of the heat exchanger system, and the fact that they will share infrastructure with research furnace systems already in operation, it will be necessary to do the installation with an absolute minimum amount of disruption to ongoing research.  This requires specialized knowledge of the existing systems, CFD, engineering design, and the capabilities needed for the new heat exchanger system.

<DESC>SUBJECT:  COAL-FIRED LABORATORY SCALE COMBUSTOR DESC:  The U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA intends to award a purchase order on a sole-source basis to Energy & Environmental Research Center (ERRC), University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, ND for the purchase for a Coal-Fired Laboratory Scale Combustor to include the following specifications: NETL is looking to purchase a pulverized coal-fired laboratory combustion system for mercury and air toxics research. The combustion system must be a complete, fully-functioning system including all components for the: pulverized coal feed system, automated control system, data acquisition system, safety systems, combustion air preheater, main furnace section and convective pass system up to but not including the particulate control device. The combustion system should have a nominal coal firing rate of 4.4 lb coal/hr (2 kg/hr), furnace gas temperatures in the 2732F (1500C) range, coal particle residence times in the high temperature radiant zone of the furnace for a minimum of 1 second, capability to burn all ranks of coal without requiring co-firing of any other fuel, and greater than 99 percent carbon burnout with all ranks of coal without co-firing any other fuel. Methods of providing heat input to satisfy holding heat requirements should be explicitly described in any submitted bid. The system must include a pulverized coal feed system capable of precisely measuring and controlling the coal feed rate. The system must also include a fully integrated automated control system to monitor and control combustion and safety functions as well as full data acquisition capabilities. Automated control system requirements include temperature, pressure, flow, safety monitoring and control instrumentation for: combustion air, fuel supply, cooling water and flue gas parameters including induced draft and baghouse controls. Data acquisition must include these parameters as well as inputs from combustion gas analyzers (DO NOT include gas analyzers in submitted bids). The combustion system must be delivered with complete documentation including detailed design drawings and other detailed design information as well as an operations manual including step-by-step operating and maintenance instructions. In addition to the items listed above, all bids submitted must include: materials of construction of the furnace and all other components, refractory types and thicknesses, dimensions of the furnace and all system components, detailed information and specifications of the pulverized coal feed system, detailed information and specifications of the fully integrated automated control system with data acquisition capabilities. This purchase order is being issued to Energy & Environmental Research Center because NETL researchers in the area of mercury capture require a coal-fired laboratory scale combustor that will generate documented levels of mercury speciation and air toxics for a given coal feed and known operational parameters.  Since it is essentially impossible to make accurate theoretical predictions of the extent generated in a laboratory scale coal-fired combustor, it is critical that the combustion system is a proven commercial design that has been operated, with mercury speciation experimental results available in the peer-reviewed literature.  The Energy and Environmental Research Center located at the University of North Dakota is the only vendor that can supply a lab scale coal combustor, whose mercury speciation and air toxics performance is documented in the external peer reviewed literature.  Theoretical predictions and unsubstantiated claims by other vendors are not sufficient to establish that their combustor can fully satisfy NETL research performance requirements as the unit produced by EERC. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by this agency.  All interested firms must respond to DE-RQ26-05NT500908. Offerors shall provide sufficient technical literature, documents, etc., in order for the Government evaluation team to make an adequate technical assessment of the quote as meeting technical acceptability.

The system must be capable of performing qualitative, â€œstandardlessâ€ semi-quantitative, and quantitative analyses by calibrated and Fundamental Parameter methods.  Additionally the system will include a micro area and mapping analysis capability to allow the viewing and analysis of small samples, or small areas on larger samples, at a spot size down to 500 microns.  The system will include the ability to determine the uniformity and/or thickness of coatings or thin films on a substrate.  The WDXRF system must be capable of analyzing solids (metals and ceramics), liquids, glass disks, and powers without dissolution of samples.  The following specifications are required: Purchase Specifications for a Wavelength Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometer Description/Specifications/Work Statement: The U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s (DOE) Albany Research Center (ARC) has a need for a fully automated sequential wavelength dispersive x-ray fluorescence (WDXRF) spectrometer that is capable of analyzing from Be4 to U92 when equipped with the proper crystals.  The WDXRF will have maximum flexibility for supporting a wide range of DOE and ARC research projects.  The following specification is intended for use in research analyses using calibrated analytical programs, as well as, analyses on a wide range of materials for which certified standards are not available.  It should be capable of performing qualitative, â€œstandardlessâ€ semi-quantitative, and quantitative analyses by calibrated and Fundamental Parameter methods.  Additionally, a micro area and mapping analysis system will provide the ability to view and analyze small samples or small areas on large samples at a spot size down to 500 microns.  It can also be used to determine the uniformity or thickness of coatings or thin films on a substrate.  Solids (metals), liquids, glass disks, and powders can be analyzed with the specified WDXRF, ensuring a non-destructive and environmentally safe analytical method which does not require the dissolution of samples or the disposal of hazardous waste solvents. X-ray Generator: ï‚§ The spectrometer must be a sequential, 4kW unit. ï‚§ Light, ultra-light, and low intensity heavy elements will be analyzed on this system.  The high frequency 4kW x-ray tube should be of end-window design with a Be window thickness of no more than 30Î¼m in order to deliver as much flux to the sample surface, producing a high intensity response from the elements. ï‚§ The tube should have a Rh target and be of micro focus design. ï‚§ To reduce maintenance and guarantee a constantly clear optics path, the WDXRF system must have tube and optics above the sample.  This design will help protect and keep the x-ray tube clean from spills or sample degradation. X-ray Voltage & Current: upper limits of at least 60kV, 150mA 20kV-60kV (1kV increments) 2mA-150mA currents (1mA increments) Output Power Rating: 4000 Watts Output Stability:   at least Â±0.005% at Â±10% input variation for both voltage and current Protective Features: Indicator of abnormal temperature of secondary cooling water  Abnormal conductivity of secondary cooling water  Water failure relay  Tube voltage leakage  X-ray indication lamp problem  Over-voltage limit  Under-voltage limit  Tube current problem  Supply voltage problem Spectrometer Characteristics: For efficiency of space, a system with a small footprint is preferred.

Diaphragm settings shall include (or be reasonably similar to) 30mm, 20mm, 10mm, 5mm, 1mm, and 0.5mm.  There must be an automatic attenuator (1/10 of x-ray intensity) that sits in front of the detector. Automatic Mask Size Detection System Since samples of different sizes will need to be analyzed through qualitative routines using a standardless Fundamental Parameter calculation, a system for sensing sample cup masks of varying sizes in the same analysis run is required.  This would allow a standard routine to be created without specifying the mask size, thus reducing the overall number of programs needed for the same analytical routine. Detectors The system must have a minimum of two detectors:  1.  Scintillation Counter (SC)  2.  Flow Proportional Counter (F-PC) ï‚§ The flow proportional detector must have an auto center wire clean feature to lessen down time due to center wire replacement. This feature will assist in maintaining a reproducible, long term response from those elements analyzed by this detector through the ability to clean the detector center wire as its response ability degrades through particulate matter build up. ï‚§ The flow rate of P-10 gas should be no more than 10mL/min. Crystal Exchanger, Crystals, and Multilayer Materials The spectrometer shall include at least a ten position crystal exchanger. The system must have the capability of analyzing from Be4 to U92.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for Physical Science Laboratory (PSL) products including:  1 Each PSL Rack-mount Telemetry System; 1 Each PSL 94 PCM Bit Synchronizer Board; 1 Each PSL01 PCM Decommutator Board; 2 Each PSL Video Decompression Units; and 1 Each PSL03 Logger/Simulator Board.   NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items on a sole source basis from the Physical Science Laboratory (PSL) at New Mexico State University.  The PSL products must be compatible with an existing government owned PSL WFF93 PCM Encoder System currently being used in support of the Inflatable Reentry Vehicle Experiment.  Substitution of other than PSL equipment with the existing encoder system and PSL TDAS software would negatively impact the operability of the entire system.	Sole source authority for this procurement is FAR 13.106-1.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 9, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications ARE NOT acceptable in response to this notice.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC's Operations Integration Office has a requirement for additional operations, engineering, and integration work in support of the Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV) project.  This work includes the development of the CLV Concept of Operations Document, Operations Timeliness, and Functional Flow Block Diagrams.  This work is currently being performed by Computer Science Corporation (CSC) under NASA MSFC Purchase Order NNM05AB08P in conjunction with NASA MSFC personnel. NASA/MSFC intends to contract with CSC for the proposed effort on a sole-source basis by awarding a modification to the current purchase order to add this work, which has an estimated period of performance by three months (October 01, 2005, through December 31, 2005).	 Competition is impracticable for the following reasons: 1.  The operation engineering and integration work supporting the CLV relies heavily upon the processes and technical expertise obtained by CSC during current operations; therefore, continuity in support from CSC is critical in order to meet the aggressive Systems Requirement Review (SSR) schedule. 2.  Any disruption to schedules would adversely impact critical deadlines and potentially disrupt the SSR.  Specific expertise gained in the prior months by CSC cannot be duplicated or communicated to another vendor in a timely manner; therefore, only CSC can provide necessary effort to support near term requirements without impacting the schedule. 3.  The cost to bring another contractor up to speed would represent substantial duplication of cost to the government which is not expected to be recovered through competition.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:00 p.m. local time on September 08, 2005.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL), located in Ann Arbor, MI, intends to acquire, on a competitive basis, a research study  designed to improve the methods and tools used by the Agency to estimate emissions from nonroad equipment. Data to be collected include populations, usage rates (activity) and in-use or real-world emission rates. This study will combine rapid in-use measurement capability with statistical survey design to improve the representation of nonroad engine populations. Performance of field work will involve the installation and operation of portable on-board instruments to measure exhaust emissions and equipment usage. Data will be collected during normal operation at participants? facilities or work sites. Prior to and during field work, statistical sampling will be applied to randomize the  recruitment and screening of participants and the selection of equipment pieces. Emissions and usage will be measured using portable emissions measurement systems (PEMS) and portable activity measurement systems (PAMS), respectively. The PEMS will measure carbon dioxide (CO2) and several air pollutants on an continuous basis during normal operation over a period of one to three days. Air pollutants to be measured include carbon monoxide (CO), total hydrocarbons (THC), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter (PM). The PAMS will measure engine on/off over a period of approximately three months. The target population includes nonroad equipment used by commercial establishments in the Mining, Construction, Manufacturing and Agricultural sectors. The study area for this collection will be EPA Region 7, which includes the states of Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas and Missouri. To estimate the prevalence of equipment ownership in the target sectors, 1,540 establishments will be requested to respond to brief interviews regarding their equipment ownership and use. The total sample size for instrumented measurement is 360 equipment pieces, with 150 and 210 pieces targeted for emissions and usage measurement, respectively.  Following quality-assurance and analysis, the data will be stored in OTAQ?s Mobile Source Observation Database. This requirement is BRAND NEW. There is no predecessor contract. The solicitation will be issued as a 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE. EPA anticipates the award of a single firm-fixed-price type contract. The period of performance will be for 20 months from the date of award. EPA anticipates an award around December 15, 2005.  Solicitation No. PR-CI-05-10873 is expected to be issued around October 1, 2005 and close 30 days thereafter. It will be available on the Internet at www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd. Draft copies of the statement of work, pertinent attachments, and technical evaluation criteria are currently available for download.  Interested parties are expected to download the solicitation and subsequent amendments from the web site. Hard copies will not be distributed. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to frequently check the site for amendments. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by EPA. Contract award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation. The applicable NAICS code is 541710.

The system shall provide natural abundance-level measurements of: (1) the stable isotopic compositions of methane (13C/12C), carbon dioxide (13C/12C and 18O/16O), nitrous oxide (15N/14N and 18O/16O), O2 and N2 and also Ar/N2  ratios; (2) the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition of water; and (3) the stable carbon isotopic composition of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). A major requirement of the IRMS system is that it be configured for maximum flexibility and efficiency in completing sample analyses and to minimize system downtime.   The system should include: (1) one or more continuous flow (CF) isotope ratio mass spectrometers (IRMS); (2) one or more automated, computer-controlled preparation modules for unattended preparation of multiple samples for IRMS analysis; and (3) a computer data system (DS) to control the various components of the stable isotope ratio preparation and analysis system and for data acquisition and manipulation.   The system should also interface with our: (1) GV Instruments (formerly Fisons) NA 1500 NC elemental analyzer (EA) to allow automated analysis of stable C and N isotope ratios of bulk organic materials and the stable N isotope ratio of ammonium adsorbed to KHSO4-impregnated filters; (2) our Hewlett Packard (HP) 5890 Series II gas chromatograph (GC)/ GV Instruments (formerly Fisons) Isochrom III combustion system to allow analysis of the 13C/12C of individual peaks eluted from a capillary GC column; and (3) our GV Instruments (formerly Fisons) dual reference gas injector box. The system should also include an EA-diluter to allow sequential stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratio determination for samples in which N and C compositions differ significantly.  Conversion among the various configurations should require one hour or less.  The DS should allow export of data to Excel spreadsheet format and report the stable isotopic data in the standard delta notation in parts-per-thousand (?):  dHX (?) = [((HX/LX)sample / (HX/LX)standard) - 1] * 1000 where HX/LX is  13C/12C, 15N/14N, D/H, or 18O/16O. The stable isotope ratio preparation and analysis system should be capable of determining highly precise stable isotope ratios of the following components at the listed minimum sample sizes and with stated precision (? one standard deviation): Methane (13C/12C): 0.2 microliters (? 0.3 ?) Nitrous oxide (15N/14N and 18O/16O): 40 nanoliters (? 0.3 ?) Carbon dioxide (13C/12C and 18O/16O):  0.2 microliters (? 0.3 ?) O2 (18O/16O): 10 microliters (? 0.3 ?) N2 (15N/14N): 10 microliters (? 0.3 ?) Water (D/H and 18O/16O): 200 microliters (? 1.5 ? and ? 0.3 ?, respectively) DOC and DIC  (13C/12C): 5 micrograms of C (? 0.3 ?)

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE SINGLE SOURCE CONTRACT: The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to award a firm fixed price contract modification on a sole source basis to:  Grant Thornton, LLP, 333 John Carlyle St., Suite 500, Alexandria, VA 22314, to continue collecting data that will further validate the findings of the original Activity-Based Costing (ABC) study already completed.  The purpose of this effort is to acquire contractor services to accomplish the following:  (1) Review the costs associated with passenger and baggage screening services at 7 additional airports and add the resulting data to the Activity-Based Costing (ABC) model; (2) Identify the cost of operations at the studied airports that apply to opt-out under the Screening Partnership Program (SPP);  (3) Analyze the centralized costs broken down into cost pools based on drivers so that TSA can determine how to apply centralized costs to individual airports, i.e., determine what percentages of those costs can be attributed to a specific airport and how much of that budget would no longer be performed by TSA if an airport elects to go from federal to private screening personnel; and (4) Populate the previously established cost management framework with data on the additional airports to support continued implementation of a sustainable cost management solution using ABC.  The added data in the framework provides TSA the ability to regularly analyze resource costs, activity and process costs as well as the full cost of service on both an aggregate and unit basis. The collection of airport data will be used to refine and update the existing ABC models and advance decision-support initiatives throughout TSA. This effort will allow TSA to more accurately calculate the total cost (direct and indirect) of airports changing from federal to private screening services.  The authority for this non-competitive action,  TSA Management Directive No. 300.4 Competition & Single Source Acquisition, which is statutorily authorized by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) of 2001, P.L. 107-71, 49 U.S.C. d106 (l) and (m), and further regulatorily governed by paragraph 3.2.2.4 of the Acquisition Management System (AMS) for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), allows award of single source contracts when a rational basis is documented based on emergencies, standardization, and/or only source available to satisfy the mission requirement within the time required.   GT is the only responsible source that can provide the services within the timeframe without the expense of substantial rework and development costs, and no other services will satisfy agency requirements within the required time period. It is planned that this modification to the current contract will be awarded with a period of performance of six (6) months only.  Alternative services will not be considered.

Through previous 8(a) GSA FAST awards N61339-02-F-0230 and N61339-04-F-0308 RDR, Inc has acquired these skill sets over a three-year period of existing system modification to the Forward Observer Training System and over the last year has been an integral team member of the MSAT IPT.  RDR designed and developed an HLA compliant architecture to allow interoperability, implemented a true 3-D trajectory to provide realistic ballistic fly-out modeling and munition range limitations, developed voice recognition and data parsing to provide an intelligent tutor, developed an automated Fire Direction Center response to provide USMC compliant Call For Fire procedures, assisted in the design of the MSAT architecture, validated interface requirements for components listed in Para. 4. e., and participated in all SME data collection of CAS and CFF.

Full & Open competition would require that any other vendor conduct lengthy analysis of presently developed technical approach and system design.  Additionally, it would require review Phase I capability based on existing GOTS/COTS technology and would require significant SME understanding of Close Air Support and Supporting Arms functionality (Artillery, Mortar & Naval Gunfire).  The Government believes this effort would require 3-6 months of analysis and review to adequately perform these services.  This significant analysis and review would result in duplicated costs to the Government that would not be recovered.  The contract’s period of performance will be eight (8) months.

Sources that wish to express capabilities that contradict the above justification should submit such capabilities to the identified contact specialist no later than the closing date of this notice.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Office of Education and Sustainable Development (OESD), is tasked with developing a comprehensive education program as part of NOAA’s overall strategic plan. This task requires an assessment of the integration of ocean and atmospheric science into the K-12 curricula.  OESD intends to negotiate with Technical Education Research Centers, Inc. (TERC) on a sole source basis.  This requirement is being advertised under Other Than Full and Open Competition by the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 citing 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Contractor shall be required to provide the Office of Education and Sustainable Development (OESD), with an assessment of the integration of Ocean and Atmospheric Science into Student Learning in accordance with the Statement of Work.  Scope of Work:  TERC shall evaluate ocean and atmospheric science in K-12 curricula.  TERC shall undertake a series of activities that shall assist OESD in evaluating the inclusion of ocean and atmospheric science in K-12 curricula, and identify programs which may benefit from NOAA assistance.  These activities shall include:  a. In phase one (‘research”), TERC shall study the K-12 science curricula in all fifty states, looking explicitly at how oceans and atmospheres are included. TERC shall create two products during phase one – a printed report and a web site.  b. In phase two (“support for reform”), TERC shall begin with a “gap analysis”.  In reviewing the 50 state curricula, TERC shall look for curricula that might benefit from advice and support. The products of phase two are the gap analysis report, and a report on input provided and change status in each of the targeted states. Currently, NOAA does not possess internal capacity to perform such a task.  Successful completion of this effort requires demonstrated understanding of Earth System Science education, a working knowledge of state curricula and science education standards, and a demonstrated ability to understand and affect education policy at the local and state levels.  TERC is uniquely qualified for this requirement Infusing NOAA-relevant ocean and atmospheric science content in the science curricula and standardized testing of different states is critical for the successful implementation of the NOAA Education Plan, and has been identified as a priority by the NOAA Education Council. First steps for accomplishing this are to determine the current level of inclusion of such content in all fifty states and to identify and focus resources on the best candidate states for affecting systemic change.  The Technical Education and Research Centers, Inc. is uniquely positioned to carry out these evaluations as an educational non-profit with a combination of expertise in Earth science education and policy reform.  TERC is highly regarded for its innovative work in science, math and technology education.  TERC’s Center for Earth and Space Science Education has 27 staff, including Earth scientists, educators, cognitive psychologists, technology specialists and policy reform experts, working on over a dozen leading-edge projects in Earth and space science education.  TERC has had numerous NSF and NASA funded projects. Of greatest relevance to this NOAA initiative, was the National Conference on the Revolution in Earth and Space Science Education, and the State Alliances for Earth Science Education in which five state-based teams are reviewing and refining their local Earth science curricula.  Interested parties who believe they can meet the Agency’s requirement are requested to submit in writing an affirmative administrative response demonstrating their technical capabilities which shall be considered by the Agency. This response must be received no later than close of business on September 15, 2005. In your response you must address each of the items described in the Statement of Work in sufficient detail to permit Agency analysis to establish a bona fide capacity to meet the requirement.  Failure to submit documentation will result in the Agency proceeding as stated above.  A determination by the Agency not to open competition is solely within the discretion of the Agency.  Please reference # NAAA0500-5-0023 with any correspondence.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG),  Nutritional Epidemiology Branch (NEB) plans to contract on a sole source basis with Fundação de Apoio a Tecnologia e Ciencia (FATEC), Rua Q, Prédio 66, Universidad Federal de Santa Maria, Campus Universitario – Faixa de Camobi Km 9 97105-900 – Santa Maria – RS - Brazil for: PAH exposure in Southern Brazil.   The acquisition is being conducted under the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M.  Background:  The Nutritional Epidemiology Branch (NEB), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI conducts intramural research in areas related to nutrition and cancer aimed at lowering human cancer risk. Esophageal cancer is a very common cancer worldwide, and is a particular focus of NEB research. Rio Grande do Sul Province (RS), Brazil, has high rates of esophageal cancer, the etiologic factors for which are only partially known.  Previous studies have suggested that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are found in tobacco smoke and well-done meat, may increase rates of esophageal cancer. Dr. Renato Fagundes, a gastroenterologist at the Federal University of Santa Maria (Universidade Federal de Santa Maria) in Santa Maria, RS, recently completed a study to assess PAH exposure in this area, and he has questionnaire data, frozen urine samples, and buccal swab samples from 200 healthy adults.  The NEB would like to evaluate the questionnaire data for possible sources of PAH exposure, including smoking, meat consumption, and other variables.  The NEB would also like to assay the urine for 1-hydroxypyrene glucuronide (1-OHPG), a metabolite of PAHs, and cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine, to evaluate levels of PAH exposure and evidence of recent smoking, and we would like to test the DNA from the buccal swab samples to evaluate genetic polymorphisms that may be related to PAH metabolism. The contractor shall anonymize PAH questionnaire data, frozen urine samples, and buccal swab samples from 200 healthy adults from Rio Grande do Sul Province, so the data and samples cannot be linked to individuals, enter the questionnaire data in an Excel database and submit the database, urine samples and buccal swab samples to NEB.  The Federal University of Santa Maria (Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM)) is the only major research institution in central Rio Grande do Sul Province.  Data and specimens from the study that they recently completed will satisfy the need of the government to evaluate PAH exposure in this population, and no similar data or specimens exist from another source.  Fundação de Apoio a Tecnologia e Ciencia is the only known source to the NCI that can successfully complete this project.  Period of Performance:   Six months from date of award.  This is a notice of intent not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT on September 12 2005.  If you have any questions, please submit them in writing via electronic mail to Karen Gardner, Contract Specialist at gardnerka@mail.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov and the online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intend to negotiate on a sole source basis with Travel Market Insights (TMI).  This requirement is being advertised under Other Than Full and Open Competition by the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1, citing 41 U.S.C. 2304(c), only one responsible source and no other type supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.   The U.S. Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration, Services, Office of Travel & Tourism Industries (OTTI) conducts a Travel Barometer program on behalf of the U.S. Government. The current programs are in Germany, the United Kingdom and Mexico with one additional survey program being conducted in Japan.  These surveys are the only short-term, in-country, trade-based surveys being conducted to monitor and estimate future travel demands to the United States.  The travel barometer has quickly become a necessary resource for U.S. small business and governments working in the travel and tourism industry. Currently the Travel Barometer gathers consistent input from in-market travel trade on current market indicators and provides this information to U.S. destinations and businesses interested in understanding market changes and expanding export investments.   No other source provides a short-term forecast on market conditions.  

Statement of Need:  Collection of travel information in the US-Mexico market is a challenge. With the exception of the longer-haul markets, which can be gauged by I-94 and In-Flight Survey data, OTTI is reliant on the Mexican Government (Banco de Mexico and Sectur) to provide total market data. The Barometer provides an independent estimate of the arrival market.   In 2004 an estimated 11.9 million Mexicans visited the U.S., more than 25 percent of all visitors to the U.S.  The UK to US market targeted by the U.S. Department of Commerce, for a Promotional Campaign, uses funds appropriated by Congress.   The Barometer assists in the monitoring of intended travel to the US by UK travelers.  The program provides the Office of Travel and Tourism Industries with substantial strategic presence in the United Kingdom by partnering with the U.S. Commercial Service, Visit USA Association - UK, and the top trade in the UK that sell and promote travel to the United States.   The German to the U.S. market is the third largest arrival market from overseas.  It is the only ongoing travel trade executive survey to monitor market conditions and has become a staple for U.S. businesses and destinations.  No other resource, of this type, is available to U.S. businesses and destinations.  The program provides the Office of Travel and Tourism Industries with substantial strategic presence in Germany by partnering with the U.S. Commercial Service, Visit USA Germany, and the top trade in Germany that sell and promote travel to the United States.  The barometer is a qualitative survey designed to collect input from active travel trade working in-country to sell and promote travel in the United States.  The goal is to provide a short term forecast on travel demand and market conditions in each of the participating countries. 
 
Interested parties who believe they can meet the Agency’s requirement are requested to submit in writing an affirmative response demonstrating heir technical capabilities.  To be considered an affirmative response, all response must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet the above requirements.  In your response, you must address each of the items listed above in sufficient detail to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement.  Failure to submit documentation will result in the Agency proceeding as stated above.  A determination by the Agency not to open competition is solely within the discretion of the Agency. A written affirmative response must be received no later than ten (10) days after the publication of this synopsis.  The solicitation will be issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) utilizing Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The Agency anticipates award of a firm fixed price purchase order.  The period of performance shall be one year from date of award.  Responses may be e-mailed to Cathy.A.Green@noaaa.gov.  Reference Requisition number TAMS-6740-05-90654 in your response.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue an order under NAVAIR Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00421-05-G-0001 with Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation (NGSC), 600 Grumman Road West, Bethpage NY 11714, for engineering and technical services to develop and test a Non-Cooperative Combat ID Capability (NCID) for the E-2 (E-2C/E-2D) aircraft. The objective of this effort is to demonstrate the operation of an electronically scanned prototype antenna, that will be used with a specialized receiver and signal processor, for the detection and processing of airborne emissions leading to an NCID capability for E-2 (E-2C/E-2D) aircraft. NAVAIR intends to negotiate this order on a sole source basis with NGSC. This procurement represents a follow-on integration effort for the prototype antenna currently under development by NGSC. NGSC is the designer, developer and sole manufacturer of the E-2 (E-2C/E-2D) Aircraft and Weapon System and as such is the only firm with the knowledge, and integration experience necessary to fulfill these requirements. This synopsis is for informational purposes only. See Note 22.

<DESC>Note:  Change of contracting contacts as list above and also in the body of the document. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is available on both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) web site located at http://www.eps.gov or http://www.fedbizopps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command. The Program Executive Office Littoral Mine Warfare - Unmanned Undersea Vehicle Program Office (PMS 403), Washington Navy Yard, Washington, DC, is soliciting new and innovative concepts in the development and demonstration of technologies applicable to UUVs. The growing use of unmanned systems in the air, on the ground, or underwater continually demonstrates new possibilities/capabilities to maintain our naval forces' maritime superiority around the world. One can conceive scenarios where UUVs sense, track, identify, target, and destroy an enemy -- all autonomously within the full net-centric battlespace. The long-term UUV vision is to have the capability to (1) deploy or retrieve devices; (2) gather, transmit, and act on all types of information; and (3) engage bottom, volume, surface, air or land targets.  To this end, the Navy is soliciting proposals in the following areas:  (1)	Autonomy. Autonomy is needed to support long, complex missions in unpredictable or harsh environments. It includes the need to make independent decisions based on the mission goals, environmental conditions, and remaining energy on-board. Additional needed capabilities include the need to avoid obstacles and entanglements, to react to changes in ambient conditions, and to engage in group behavior when multiple UUVs act as a team.  (2)	Energy and Propulsion. Low-cost, high energy density, reliable, safe, long-duration easily recharged or refueled power sources are needed. Energy source for air-independent power is desired to minimize the size, cost, and signature of the energy and propulsion system. Advanced energy and propulsion, in combination with other UUV technologies, will enable the use of smaller vehicles that reduce cost in the long term while providing greater performance.  (3)	Advanced Sensors and Sensors Processing. All UUV missions depend on the effective use of sensors. Development in the sensor area needs to be concentrated in increasing area coverage rate (ACR), improving classification and identification capabilities, employment and packaging of low-power electronics, non-traditional tracking techniques, and multi-threat chemical, biological, nuclear, radiological, and explosive (CBNRE) sensors.  (4)	Communications and Networking. Real-time, or near real-time, RF communications of sensor data from the vehicle in operational sea states is needed. Acoustic or other (e.g. laser) underwater communication technologies to provide communications at useful data rates and provide navigation aids on demand are desired.  (5)	Launch and Recovery. Launch and Recovery (L&R) is a key feature of any UUV system, and it is closely related to the vehicle size and host platform characteristics. Development of innovative multi-platform L&R concepts, as well as deployment and possible recovery of payloads from host UUV, are desired.     (6)	Engagement and Intervention. The development of technology is necessary to support net extraction. Engagement and intervention techniques are required for a wide range of missions, particularly those requiring long transits and interactions with targets. The UUV missions envisioned may require solutions that range from non-lethal to neutralization.  (7)	Modeling and Simulation. Modeling and simulation are needed for UUV mission planning and reconstruction, vehicle testing, software design and testing, and training. This BAA will be open for one year from the date of the announcement. Proposals may be submitted at any time within that period.  Contracts and "other transactions" may be awarded, as appropriate, and will be limited by funding availability. Therefore, early submission of proposals is desirable and encouraged. Navy evaluation will commence after 1 March 2005 and initial awards are anticipated in third quarter FY05. Proposals should be submitted to: COMMANDER, Naval Sea Systems Command, ATTN: Code 02635S, Cara L. Spiro, 1333 Isaac Hull Avenue, S.E., Washington Navy Yard, Washington, DC 20376.  Contracting Point of Contact is Cara L. Spiro, telephone (202) 781-2989, e-mail cara.spiro@navy.mil. This synopsis constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) per FAR 6.102(d)(2)(i); there will be no formal request for proposals (RFP) or other solicitation in regard to this announcement.     Because both the technical and cost aspects of an offeror's submission will be evaluated at the same time, it is desirable that one volume containing all information be submitted. In presenting the proposal material, prospective offerors are advised that quality of the information is significantly more important than the quantity. Therefore, offerors are requested to confine their submissions to essential matters, providing sufficient information to define their offer and establish an adequate basis for the Government to conduct its evaluation. Offerors may submit their proposals (two paper copies and ten electronic copies on CD using Microsoft Office 2000 or earlier).  Respondents must be able to certify that they have an appropriate facility clearance to meet the security requirements of work proposed, and key personnel must be certified as holding an appropriate clearance. Proposals shall consist of one volume consisting of the technical proposal, management approach, and!  cost. The technical proposal is limited to 20 pages exclusive of the Statement of Work (paragraph (7), below) and cost information, which has no page limit. Pages are to be 8.5 x 11 inch, single-sided. Minimum font is 10 point. Succinct proposals are desired.  The technical portion shall consist of the following sections, each starting on a new page:  (1) A cover page, including proposal title, technical and administrative points-of-contact along with the telephone and facsimile numbers, followed by a letter signed by the authorized officer specifying the proposal validity period (at least 120 days); (2) An Executive Overview of the proposed technologies and/or concepts as well as any innovative claims for the proposed research, and how they will contribute to and support the objectives of a technology evaluation and demonstration; (3) A detailed technical proposal of the primary precepts of the concept with appropriate elaboration as to the ingenuity associated with the co! ncept. This section shall not exceed 10 pages. (4) A summary of the deliverables including data associated with the proposed research. (5) A summary of the schedule and milestones for the proposed effort that can be traced to the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). (6) A one-page WBS. (7) A succinct Statement of Work clearly detailing the scope and objectives of the work and, if any, specific contractor requirements. The statement of work should only document the specific work to be performed as discussed in section (3) above. Any disclosure of information as relating to the merits of the concept included in the Statement of Work but not included in the detailed technical proposal required by paragraph (3) above will not be considered for award selection. If any portion of the proposed effort is predicated upon the use of Government-owned resources of any type, the contractor shall clearly identify: the resources required, the date the resource is required, the duration of the r! equirement, the source from which the resource may be acquired, if known, and the impact on the effort if the resource is not provided. (8) A description of the results, products, and transferable technology expected from the contract. This section should specifically address any intellectual property claims associated with the outcome of this effort. (9) A brief discussion of past performance detailing previous accomplishments and work in this or closely related research areas, previous cost and schedule performance, and the qualifications of the previous key personnel. (10) A brief discussion of the overall approach to the management of this effort, including brief discussions of total organization, use of personnel and their qualifications, project/function/subcontractor relationships, technology transition plans, government interfaces, and planning, scheduling, and control practices. The cost portion shall include the one-page work breakdown structure, a cost summary, an! d a detailed breakdown of cost for the effort. The selection of proposals for contract award will be based on a scientific review of proposals submitted in response to each BAA. The major purpose of the evaluation will be to determine the relative merit of the technical approach of each proposal. Business and contractual aspects, including proposed cost and cost realism, will also be considered as part of the evaluation. Selection of proposals for award will be based on the potential benefits to the Government weighed against the cost of the proposals, in view of the availability of funds. Specific evaluation criteria are as follows:  (1)	Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to PMS403 programs are proposed, their feasibility, and the offeror's understanding of the proposed approach and technical objectives. It is desirable that the developments be structured in phases to allow assessment and/or decision points, where allowable;  (2)	The offeror's ability to implement the proposed approach as demonstrated by specific accomplishments in the technical field to be studied, the qualifications (including past performance) of the proposed principal investigator and other personnel, and the availability of appropriate facilities;  (3)	The degree to which technical data and/or computer software developed under the proposed contract are to be delivered to NAVSEA with rights compatible with NAVSEA research and development objectives; and (4)	The extent to which offerors identify and commit to small businesses and to small disadvantaged businesses, HUBZone small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, women-owned small businesses, historically black colleges and universities, or other minority institution participation in the proposed effort, whether as a joint venture, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor relationship.  THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR AWARD ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED.

<SUBJECT>99--FLAT PANEL DISPLAY
<SOLNBR>N0025305R0020
<RESPDATE>092105
<CONTACT>Carol Evonick, evonickcj@kpt.nuwc.navy.mil
<DESC>N00253-05-R-0020, AMENDMENT 0002, FLAT PANEL DISPLAY Subject Amendment is being issued to: A.  Modify the Statement of Work, Item 4 to include the following: Paragraph 4.d d.  Burn Period.  Each display is required to undergo a 24 hour burn in period to ensure proper operation.  During the burn in period, the display must at a minimum, show color or white across the entire screen. B.  To include an additional drawing 7110962 (-).  To receive this drawing, contractors shall send an email including the solicitation number and the requested drawing number to: evonickcj@kpt.nuwc.navy.mil. C.  Respond to the following questions: 1.  On page 6, line 4 the power connector is called out as IEC 320. On page 8, line 3 the power connector is “capable of mating to MS274467T09B98B.  We believe the latter is correct but you confirm the desired input power connector. ANSWER:  The MS number is the correct connecter callout.   2.  Paragraph 3(e)1 on page 8 of the solicitation (Environmental Requirements) states that monitors must have test report data to support claims that the monitor meets "Shock: MIL-S-901D: Grade A Shock, Class I or II, Type A qualified. 100g's peak (data filtered using 250Hz lowpass filter)/320g's  (unfiltered) during MIL-STD-901D unisolated shock testing." This is a non-standard test, as MIL-S-901D specifies shocks according to drop hammer height or barge explosion depth, not peak g's.  If a modified MIL-S-901D test is required to be run on the monitors can a test procedure be supplied that specifies the method for obtaining the required peak g's on a lightweight hammer?  Can an extension to the proposal submittal due date be provided to bidders who wish to schedule and perform the modified shock test on their equipment, so the required test data can be provided?  Or will standard MIL-S-901D lightweight hammer test data be acceptable? ANSWER: The display is to be shocked according to MIL-S-901D requirements, however, it must also be mounted in a configuration equivalent to that seen aboard ship.  There is a frame located at government facilities and is available for testing.  This frame will be placed onto a medium weight hammer table with forces expected to reach those described in the solicitation. Due to time constraints that the government must operate under, there will be no extension for testing.  If testing is requirement, the contractor must fund 100% of testing.   Lightweight hammer testing is not acceptable; the display must be tested on a medium weight hammer table while attached to a frame.   3) Can the required pinout for the power connector that mates with MS27467T09B98B be provided (page 8, paragraph 3(d)1 Mechanical Requirements)? ANSWER:  Refer to attached drawing 53711-7110962. 4) The requirement states that shock pins are highly desirable (page 7, paragraph 3(d)1 Mechanical Requirements). However, paragraph 3(d)2 on page 8 states that the display shall contain shock pins that mate with the monitor bezel. If shock test data is provided that shows that a display has passed the stated requirement without shock test pins will that display be considered acceptable? ANSWER:  Yes, the prospective display can be accepted without shock pins so long as it passes requirements per ship configuration. 5) Page 4, paragraph 1a of the solicitation states that the display must be an existing commercial off the shelf product. Paragraph 2 (Applicable Documents) states that unless otherwise indicated, the most recent issues of the following documents forma a part of the requirement to the estent specified herein. If an existing off the shelf product has been qualified to an earlier version of a particular Military Standar (e.g., MIL-STD-461C vice MIL-STD-461E) must the product be retested prior to submitting a proposal? ANSWER:  The product must meet standards as specified by the SOW. 6) Will any exceptions to EMI/EMC performance be permitted (e.g.., non-compliances at certain frequency ranges within the tested spectrum of RE102)? ANSWER:  No. 7) Paragraph 3(c)13 on page 7 states that video compatibility testing will be performed at NUWC-DK and NSWC-PHD/NSWC-DD to demonstrate proper operation with TTWCS and NFCS video. Will this testing be performed prior to contract award? If so, on what date must test units be supplied by bidders? ANSWER:  Testing is to be completed prior to the close of the submittal period. 8) Paragraph 3(d)1 on page 7 (Physical Dimensions) states that the physical envelope must not exceed the dimensions shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 specifies a maximum depth of 3.950 inches, and allows protrusion beyond that depth within the maintenance envelope shown. Will an existing, off-the-shelf product with a maximum depth of 4.08 inches be acceptable if the envelope of the display extends beyond the maximum specified depth outside the maintenance envelope? ANSWER:  The max depth of the envelope of the monitor shall not exceed the dimensions of the maintenance envelope.  The idea of allowing protrusions outside of the 3.950 dimension is to accommodate items such as RGB terminals, power connectors, etc…  Such occurrences will be analyzed on a case by case basis.   9) Paragraph 4(e) on page 8 states that monitors must have test report data to support claims that the monitor meets the listed environmental DVT requirements (shock, vibration, airborne noise, structureborne noise, humidity, temperature, EMI, ESD, Pressure, Safety, Shipboard Transportation). However, in Section M (Evaluation Criteria), under Factor 1 (Technical) the solicitation states that the contractor's proposal shall demonstrate their ability to meet the following criteria: Existing Product, Critical Test Reports, Physical Size, Sync on Green. What is the meaning of the term "critical test reports"?  Is test data for all of these requirements to be supplied with the offeror's proposal, or only the critical test reports? Can compliance with any of the non-critical environmental requirements be verified through similarity or analysis? Can any of the non-critical requirements be tested after contract award? ANSWER:  “Critical test reports” implies any rest results required by the SOW.  All test reports or analysis results are required per the SOW. All test reports are to be supplied with the offeror’s proposal.  Non-critical environmental requirements may be verified through analysis. No requirements may be tested after award. 10) Paragraph 4(a) on page 10 (Quality Assurance Provisions) states that qualification tests shall be conducted to verify conformance with the performance requirements specified herein. Paragraph 4(b) further states that the qualification testing will demonstrate compliance with the following requirements: power, functional, mechanical and environmental. Are these qualification tests to be performed by the selected contractor after contract award? If so, by what date? Does this paragraph imply that all environmental tests must be repeated even if test data has been supplied for prior environmental testing?  ANSWER:  The contractor shall perform Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT) of the display to ensure proper functionality.   Display FAT requirements shall consist only of functionality requirements regarding video signal input, video quality and overall appearance. 11) Will early delivery of the remaining 56 units be acceptable (i.e., can all 112 units be delivered concurrently)? ANSWER:  The government wants to ensure that the displays will be used during their warranty period.  As a result of this, the distributed shipment of displays is desired.  If the warranty period is extended to meet the government’s needs, the government will accept 112 units simultaneously.    12) Paragraph 3(e) (Environmental Requirements) on page 8 states that the display will satisfy the following requirements ... during the DVT activities when mounted on the ATDC. What is the schedule for performing DVT with units mounted on the ATDC? How many units must the display supplier provide for this testing?  ANSWER:  All testing is to be done prior to the contractor proposal submittal period.  A minimum of two displays are required for testing in a serial testing process.  Additional displays should be supplied to quicken the process. Closing date remains unchanged

<DESC>CONTRACTING OFFICE ADDRESS: National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD 20771.  INTRODUCTION: NASA is currently compiling an integrated portfolio to represent the state of U.S. technology in the area of spacecraft formation flying.  In order to confine the scope of this call, it will cover only unique capabilities to enable spacecraft formation flying in the specific categories defined in Appendix A.  The portfolio will be export-controlled and may include supplements with proprietary or classified protections.   The means of collection will be through secure electronic submission of standard format data sheets, following the formats in Appendix B and possible short presentation at a workshop in a proprietary or non-proprietary setting, to be defined at a later date.  The workshop will be open only to U.S. Government civil servants and members of the presenting organization.   It is anticipated that all submitted data sheets representing technologies at technology readiness level (TRL) 2 or above will be included in the collection, provided that submission requirements are met.  However, due to time constraints, it is possible that only a subset of those who request to present orally will be selected to present, based on current requirements, maturity, and credibility.   Please carefully review Appendix A for the appropriate submission area, if there is more than one for a system-level technology area, then please select the best fit area.  We anticipate the following categories of submission: 1.  Export controlled and/or proprietary data, unclassified 2.  Unrestricted, unlimited distribution data, unclassified 3.  Data classified SECRET, collateral 4.  Data classified TOP SECRET, collateral 5.

The Deputy USAID Representative will review and approve the FSN-PSC’s work plan and performance measures. The incumbent will be expected to work independently, take initiative, and be responsible for advising on all aspects of USG supported Democracy & Governance program activities.  In carrying out specific assignments, the incumbent will work closely with senior representatives from The Republic of Yemen Government (ROYG), international donor organizations, local and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and senior U.S. Government (USG) officials at the US Embassy/Sana’a, USAID/Cairo and USAID/Washington.

D.	WORK DESCRIPTION:

There is a pressing need to support democratization and to increase its credibility in Yemen.  Democratic governance is essential to both the economic growth that Yemen desperately needs and to managing the conflicts that threaten to destabilize its internal equilibrium.  It is therefore imperative for the USG to prioritize activities to encourage Yemen’s movement towards increased democracy and governance by strengthening representative institutions and the capacity and roles of their reform-minded members, and supporting more representative participation and a more representative environment.

The Democracy and Governance Special Objective (DG SpO8) “Expanded Democracy and Governance in Yemen,” amends the USAID/Yemen Interim Strategy (May 5, 2003 - September 30, 2006) that was approved on May 5, 2003.  The DG SpO8 includes two Intermediate Results:  IR 1.0, “Representative Institutions Strengthened,” and, IR 2.0, “Opportunities for Increased Democracy and Governance Supported.” 

IR 1.0, “Representative Institutions Strengthened,” corresponds to USAID/Yemen’s core DG activities that will address key development challenges in the DG sector and that directly support other elements of the USAID development program in Yemen.  Activities under IR 1.0 will focus on the roles, capacity, processes and interrelationships among members of parliament, local councils, line ministries and community organizations and will include the allocation and oversight of funds in the national and local fiscal process.

IR 2.0, “Opportunities for Increased Democracy and Governance Supported,” provides a mechanism for USAID/Yemen, if requested, to address targets of opportunity jointly agreed to by Embassy/Sana’a and USAID/Yemen that are funded by bilateral ESF allocations to USAID/Yemen, and are cleared by the USAID Bureau for Asia and the Near East (ANE). 

The DG SpO8 will maintain the cross-cutting theme of special attention to the needs and empowerment of women that is a key objective throughout the USAID Interim Strategy for Yemen.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. This is not a request for competitive quotes and no
solicitation is available.
Please send the following information: United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS) sponsors research on new and useful products and processes which have potential application in the private and public sectors, and may seek patent rights in various foreign countries covering products and processes derived from the ARS Research.  ARS is the major research agency of the USDA and receives over 80 percent of the total patents.  USDA has the authority, pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 207 and 15 U.S.C. 3710, to obtain and maintain patents in the United States and foreign countries.  USDA can grant licenses in accordance with the regulations set forth in 37 C.F.R. Chapter IV, as amended, to receive fees, royalties or other revenues therefrom, and to take all other suitable and necessary steps to protect and administer such rights. The Office of Technology Transfer (OTT), USDA, ARS and the Forest Service (FS) requires services to docket, track, and report quarterly on the status of foreign patents including the payment of annuities, taxes and maintenance fees to maintain existing patents in force.  Currently, there are approximately 800 Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications/ International Patents for which annuities, taxes, and maintenance fees may become due and payable. ARS has a history of research collaborations with industry and academia.  Pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986, ARS has implemented a technology transfer program covering a variety of agricultural technologies that have high commercial potential to industry.  Patent applications possessing licensable beneficial foreign rights are being filed and prosecuted in foreign countries. ARS researchers currently report over 100 inventions annually.  During Fiscal Year 2004, 150 inventions were reported, 63 were filed for domestic patents and 59 patents were issued.  During the same period, 24 PCT applications were filed.  The Department has a total current patent portfolio of 2034, for which there are approximately 800 foreign filings corresponding to 99 different U.S. filings.  ARS currently contracts with the law firm of Pendorf & Cutliff for filing and prosecuting all international applications for which ARS is responsible.  FS cases are included in this contract. To serve public interest, the Government will ensure that the results of Federally-sponsored research be protected, marketed, and practiced so that maximum benefit is achieved in the form of enhanced U.S. economic activity and competitiveness.  The countries chosen for patent protection may include both member and non-member countries of the PCT.  This requirement involves services related to docketing, tracking and reporting on the status of foreign patents including the payment of requisite annuities and taxes.  The services to docket, track, and report annuities are incidental services which will support the annuity payments and taxes under any resultant contract. The requirement also requires: 1) providing incidental docketing, tracking, payment and reporting services for non-domestic patents; 2) performing the following patent-related services and purchases as may be required to maintain patents in effect: a) maintaining a current case docket to ensure that fees for annuities and taxes are paid on a timely basis; an b) entering information in its docketing system from Government-furnished and publicly available records to effect the payment of annuities, taxes and maintenance fees.  The Government provides the Contractor with a database file containing all current PCT patents which require tracking.  An already established computerized docketing, tracking, and payment system with the capabilities to calculate and administer different country-by-country patent regulations in regards to payment of annuities, taxes, and maintenance fees shall be required. The Government seeks sources who can provide a Tax Maintenance Report identifying all cases with a payment due within the quarter.  
This “Sources Sought” notice is being published to determine the availability of potential businesses, who can provide patent services with experience computerized docketing, tracking, and payment system with the capabilities to calculate and administer different country-by-country patent regulations in regards to payment of annuities, taxes, and maintenance fees.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services/Program Support Center (DHHS/PSC) intends to award a sole source simplified acquisition to the National Institute for Healthcare Management (NIHCM), Research and Educational Foundation, located in Washington, DC for the DHHS/Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). The purpose of this requirement is to convene a meeting of leading executives in health plans to discuss the role of health plans in regional health information data exchange and to yield insights into how best to promote effective adoption of health information technology (IT).  The convening of a meeting in a short timeframe requires extensive experience working with AHRQ and as a meeting planner.  NIHCM has held two previous meetings for AHRQ on related topics and provides the conceptual continuity and infrastructure to link these meeting findings together.  NIHCM is the only known source that can provide the required background, knowledge, and infrastructure to position this leadership dialogue in the framework of AHRQ's current involvement in health IT, disseminate the outcome of the meeting through their Issue Brief forum to a wide audience of relevant stakeholders, and provide the continuity of services as to not to result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements.  The period of performance shall be for a period of one year from the date of award. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541990.  Interested concerns may identify their interest and submit written documentation that demonstrates the ability to respond to this requirement within five (5) days from the date of publication of this notice.  This notice is NOT a request for proposals.  Capability statements received within 5 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Responses must be in writing and refer to 05R000196 to the attention of Susan Moran.  If no affirmative responses are received, the Contracting Officer will proceed with an award to NIHCM.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is exploring the market interest and capabilities relating to preclinical studies of new or improved pharmaceutical preparations to be used as medical countermeasures against chemical agents that could be used in a terrorist attack.  As a first step, the Institute is attempting to identify expert sources to conduct safety, pharmacokinetic/biodistribution, and developmental chemistry studies with candidate drugs.   

Background 
The increased risk of a terrorist attack in the U.S. involving chemical agents has created new challenges for many departments and agencies across the federal government. Within the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the NIH is leading the development of new and improved therapeutics designed to treat the conditions caused by potential chemical agents of terrorism. The NIH Chemical Threats program is part of the larger biodefense program coordinated by the NIAID that includes Biological and Radiation/Nuclear threats. 

Our intent is to fund a preclinical testing facility that will conduct safety, pharmacokinetic/biodistribution, and developmental chemistry studies with candidate drugs. The preclinical testing facility will not conduct any efficacy studies with drugs, or any studies with the chemical agents themselves. Candidate drugs that will be tested in this facility will have been previously shown to be efficacious by studies conducted within other NINDS programs that utilize models for, or actual, chemical agents.    Candidate drugs will be supplied to the contractor by the NINDS.   

Requirements
This facility would provide several functions:  

1.	conduct cGLP absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, including PK/PD studies, in a range of animal species for candidate drugs; 
2.	conduct cGLP toxicology safety studies for candidate drugs;
3.	conduct cGMP optimization and control studies including synthesis, composition, formulation and packaging, and stability;
4.	prepare study reports and recommendations for countermeasure modification if necessary. 

Types of potential facilities

A)	ADME Tox (numbers 1, 2, and 3 above)
B)	Developmental Chemistry (number 4 only)
C)	Facility capable of both A) and B)

Information Requested
Information in the following areas will aid in the design of solicitations for a preclinical test facility. The information supplied in any response to this request should address, but not be limited to, the following (Three Page Limit): 

1.	One paragraph introductory description of general background and research interest related to this program. 
2.	Summary of capabilities and resources related to items 1-5 listed above.  
3.	Quality of the scientific and infrastructure capabilities in support of this program, including GLP and cGMP. 
4.	Whether you are a Type A, B, or C facility as described above.
5.	Other comments and suggestion on the general program outline given above.

This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or the Government’s use of such information. Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the Government’s evaluation of the information received. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this request for information or the Government’s use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement. Responses will be held in a confidential manner. Any proprietary information should be so marked. 

All respondents are asked to indicate the type and size of your business or organization, e.g., Large Business, Small Business, Hubzone Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-Owned Business, 8(a), Historically Black College or University/Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), educational institution, profit/non-profit hospital, or other non-profit organization.

Responses should be identified with RFI No. NS-05-012, and are due by September 19, 2005. Please submit three (3) copies of your response, to Helene Braun, Contract Specialist, Contracts Management Branch, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NIH, 6001 Executive Boulevard, Room 3287, Bethesda, MD 20892-9531 (For Fedex or courier, use: Rockville, MD 20852).

<SUBJECT>68 -- Decon Foam
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories has developed and tested aqueous-based decontamination technologies (DF-100 and DF-200) that can rapidly neutralize chemical and biological warfare (CBW) agents, many toxic industrial chemicals, and a wide spectrum of biological pathogens. The formulations:
•	have been successfully demonstrated in live agent testing at approved military facilities and other independent laboratories, in field tests, and in actual use;
•	have demonstrated rapid sporicidal capabilities;
•	have low toxicity and corrosivity properties;
•	work on a number of material surfaces including those with organic loadings and biofilms;
•	can be incorporated into a wide variety of carriers (foams, gels, liquid sprays, fogs) that satisfy a wide variety of operational objectives.

DF-100 and DF-200 were developed through funding provided by the U.S. Department of Energy’s and National Nuclear Security Administration’s Chemical and Biological National Security Program (CBNP). A US patent has been granted and additional US and International patent applications are pending for these technologies. 

Sandia’s primary focus is in seeking companies interested in partnering opportunities leading to licensing and commercial manufacturing of this technology.  Partnerships may take the form of Cooperative Research & Development Agreements (CRADA) and/ or commercial licenses.  Commercial licensees will have the option to obtain, up to and including, a non-exclusive license to the intellectual property in a pre-negotiated, defined field of use for reasonable compensation.  CRADAs are expected to include funds-in to the Lab.

Sandia is specifically soliciting licensees with demonstrated track records of obtaining EPA registrations and FDA approvals, interested in licensing the DF-100 and/or DF-200 technologies primarily to develop products for industrial and commercial uses.  Some potential uses may include general disinfection and/or sterilization operations, mold remediation, consumer disinfection products, agricultural biosecurity, food processing applications and others.   Primary considerations for selection of interested parties will include (1) the ability of the licensee to acquire registration of the DF-100 and/or DF-200 technologies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), and (2) a demonstrated quality assurance program already in place by the licensee.  

For further information, interested parties should contact Teresa Montoya at Sandia National Laboratories by fax at 505-844-8011 or by email at tmontoy@sandia.gov.  Please indicate the date and title of this FBO notice and the type of partnering agreements your company would be most interested in entering into

<SUBJECT>R -- Maintenance of Puerto Rico Master Address File
<DESC>Under the authority of FAR Part 6, Subparts 6.301 and 6.302,the U.S. Census Bureau intends to issue a sole source follow-on contract to SeekData, Inc. 2715 Michigan Avenue, Kissimmee, FL 34744-1551 for the continued production of Puerto Rico Master Address file updates. 
The contractor shall provide address file deliveries to the Geography Division in support of the U.S. Census Bureau’s Puerto Rico Community Survey (PRCS).  The file deliveries must contain records representing newly constructed residential units (single-family housing, individual apts., townhouses etc.).  The address information provided with a record must conform to one of the following categories:

·	Posted house number and street name address used for mail delivery or an acceptable variations.  
·	Posted E-911 address and a mailing address (Rural Route, Highway Contract, and PO Box)
·	Posted E-911 address 
·	Rural Route and Highway Contract address, street name, and lat/long. GPS structure coordinates.
·	Name and GPS structure coordinates, but only in new residential developments with street networks that geographically isolate the developments from any surrounding residences.

All records must be geocoded to Census Bureau defined blocks. They must be standardized and parsed and each address must have a pre-defined mailing algorithm code.  Each scheduled delivery will include two files, each with the same universe of records, but in different file layouts.  One layout is for a MAF Update File and the other is for a MAF Work File.  Each address record must possess a unique identifier assign by the contractor.  For any given delivery, the identifiers must be included in both files and never repeated in subsequent deliveries. 

Four file deliveries are due on six-month intervals with the first and third deliveries due on the 15th of December in 2005 and 2006, respectively.  The second and fourth deliveries are due on the 15th of June in 2006 and 2007, respectively.  The address records must not duplicate any records previously delivered to the U.S. Census Bureau.  The Census Bureau’s expectation for the number of new address records is approximately 13,000 addresses in the first delivery and 6,500 addresses in each of the remaining three deliveries. 

It is USCB belief that SeekData's previous experience and  exisiting infrastructure would mitigate risk of substaintial duplication of cost and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements for file deliveries. 

Any responses to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.

In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities, pricing, and other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the Census Bureau's needs.     Detailed capabilities must be received at the U.S. Census Bureau by COB, September 9, 2005.     They will be provided via email to Natalie Y. Ellis (Contract Support) at natalie.y.ellis@census.gov    Ms Natalie Y. Ellis may also be contacted at 301/763-9045. 

This synopsis is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals.     No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.     No contract will be awarded on the basis of information received in response to this notice, but the information will be used to determine if acomparable sources are available.     If no affirmative written response is received by COB September 9, 2005, a contract may be issued to SeekData, Inc without further notice.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

The NFS may be obtained via the Internet at URL:  http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/nfstoc.htm   The following NASA FAR Supplement (NFS) clause and Ames Research Center (ARC) unique clause are incorporated in full text. RELEASE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION (NFS 1852.237-73) (JUNE 2005) (a) As used in this clause, ‘‘sensitive information’’ refers to information, not currently in the public domain, that the Contractor has developed at private expense, that may embody trade secrets or commercial or financial information, and that may be sensitive or privileged. (b) In accomplishing management activities and administrative functions, NASA relies heavily on the support of various service providers. To support NASA activities and functions, these service providers, as well as their subcontractors and their individual employees, may need access to sensitive information submitted by the Contractor under this contract. By submitting this proposal or performing this contract, the Contractor agrees that NASA may release to its service providers, their subcontractors, and their individual employees, sensitive information submitted during the course of this procurement, subject to the enumerated protections mandated by the clause at 1852.237–72, Access to Sensitive Information. (c)(1) The Contractor shall identify any sensitive information submitted in support of this proposal or in performing this contract. For purposes of identifying sensitive information, the Contractor may, in addition to any other notice or legend otherwise required, use a notice similar to the following: Mark the title page with the following legend: This proposal or document includes sensitive information that NASA shall not disclose outside the Agency and its service providers that support management activities and administrative functions. To gain access to this sensitive information, a service provider’s contract must contain the clause at NFS 1852.237–72, Access to Sensitive Information. Consistent with this clause, the service provider shall not duplicate, use, or disclose the information in whole or in part for any purpose other than to perform the services specified in its contract. This restriction does not limit the Government’s right to use this information if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The information subject to this restriction is contained in pages [insert page numbers or other identification of pages]. Mark each page of sensitive information the Contractor wishes to restrict with the following legend: Use or disclosure of sensitive information contained on this page is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal or document. (2) The Contracting Officer shall evaluate the facts supporting any claim that particular information is ‘‘sensitive.’’ This evaluation shall consider the time and resources necessary to protect the information in accordance with the detailed safeguards mandated by the clause at 1852.237–72, Access to Sensitive Information. However, unless the Contracting Officer decides, with the advice of Center counsel, that reasonable grounds exist to challenge the Contractor’s claim that particular information is sensitive, NASA and its service providers and their employees shall comply with all of the safeguards contained in paragraph (d) of this clause. (d) To receive access to sensitive information needed to assist NASA in accomplishing management activities and administrative functions, the service provider must be operating under a contract that contains the clause at 1852.237–72, Access to Sensitive Information. This clause obligates the service provider to do the following: (1) Comply with all specified procedures and obligations, including the Organizational Conflicts of Interest Avoidance Plan, which the contract has incorporated as a compliance document. (2) Utilize any sensitive information coming into its possession only for the purpose of performing the services specified in its contract. (3) Safeguard sensitive information coming into its possession from unauthorized use and disclosure. (4) Allow access to sensitive information only to those employees that need it to perform services under its contract. (5) Preclude access and disclosure of sensitive information to persons and entities outside of the service provider’s organization. (6) Train employees who may require access to sensitive information about their obligations to utilize it only to perform the services specified in its contract and to safeguard it from unauthorized use and disclosure. (7) Obtain a written affirmation from each employee that he/she has received and will comply with training on the authorized uses and mandatory protections of sensitive information needed in performing this contract. (8) Administer a monitoring process to ensure that employees comply with all reasonable security procedures, report any breaches to the Contracting Officer, and implement any necessary corrective actions. (e) When the service provider will have primary responsibility for operating an information technology system for NASA that contains sensitive information, the service provider’s contract shall include the clause at 1852.204–76, Security Requirements for Unclassified Information Technology Resources. The Security Requirements clause requires the service provider to implement an Information Technology Security Plan to protect information processed, stored, or transmitted from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or use. Service provider personnel requiring privileged access or limited privileged access to these information technology systems are subject to screening using the standard National Agency Check (NAC) forms appropriate to the level of risk for adverse impact to NASA missions. The Contracting Officer may allow the service provider to conduct its own screening, provided the service provider employs substantially equivalent screening procedures. (f) This clause does not affect NASA’s responsibilities under the Freedom of Information Act. (g) The Contractor shall insert this clause, including this paragraph (g), suitably modified to reflect the relationship of the parties, in all subcontracts that may require the furnishing of sensitive information. (End of Clause) SUBMISSION OF INVOICES -- FIXED PRICE (ARC 52.232-93) (MAR 2001) (a)	Invoices shall be submitted to the Accounting Operations Branch, M/S 203-18, Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA 94035-1000, in quadruplicate (an original and three copies). (b)	Reporting Requirements under Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (1)	The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, enacted August 5, 1997, requires Federal executive agencies to file information returns (i.e., Form 1099-MISC) for payment of $600 or more to corporations for services.  Payments for services under certain confidential or classified contracts that meet the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 6050M(e) are excluded from the reporting requirements.	This change became effective as of January 1, 1997. (2)	In order to comply with the Act, the contractor shall separately subtotal taxable services and nontaxable materials and supplies on each invoice.  If subtotals are not specified on the invoices, the Government will presume that the entire invoice amount is reportable and will be shown on the Form 1099-MISC generated by NASA and provided to the contractor and the Internal Revenue Service. (c)	Invoices shall denote the numerical sequence of the invoice, and shall include the contract number, delivery order number (if any), Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN#), Banking Information for Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT), contract line item number(s), description of supplies or services, quantities, unit prices, and extended totals.  If shipped on Government Bill of Lading, indicate Bill of Lading number and weight of shipment. (d)	This contract 0 does  1 does not provide for partial payments.	If applicable, payments will be made in accordance with the following schedule: (End of Clause)  Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation is a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-05  and DFARs Change Notice (DCN) 20050901. This acquisition is a full and open competition.  NAICS is 334220 with a small business size standard of 750 employees.  Solicitation is for commercial purchase of:  13 each Airborne Telmetry Bit Synchronizers and 1 each Decommutator.

Description:  The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) at Edwards AFB, 419th FLTS, 412 TW/Instrumentation Division, has a requirement for 13 each airborne bit synchronizer and decom.  In addition, it requires a non-recurring engineering effort to modify existing hardware to provide a second set of RS-422 outputs from bit sync (Data & Clock).  The ABS400 is a programmable airborne telemetry bit synchronizer and 1 each decommutator in a rugged design specifically tailored for command and control applications.  With this supplementary module, two RS-422 (differential) data and clock outputs are available from the unit.  Bit synchronizer lock is accomplished and maintained with up to eight errors in the sync code.  Loss of receiver input signal clamps the bit sync operating data rate to the pre-programmed data rate.  Programming is accomplished via an integral RS-232 port.

The basic system consists of a bit synchronizer, frame synchronizer, programming circuitry and power supply.  The system is also expandable to include analog and/or digital output ports.  The frame synchronizer examines the reconstructed digital data stream from the bit synchronizer on a bit-by-bit basis for the “best fit” pattern and outputs a sync pulse when correlation is achieved.  Lock is accomplished and maintained with up to eight errors in the sync code.

An RS-232 port on the frame synchronizer board allows many parameters, such as bits-per-word, words-per-frame, sync pattern, etc., to be programmed.  Reprogramming can be accomplished in the field with a minimum of equipment.  The unit can be configured with multiple bit synchronizers for applications requiring independent synchronization to multiple inputs.

The ABS400 model consists of a Bit Synchronizer and optional Decommutator module with an open architecture that allows other module with an open architecture that allows other module types to be incorporated into the system.  The design allows for a configuration of up to 16 modules attached to the first bit synchronizer.  Although standard building blocks are used in figuring the ABS400, each unit is custom tailored to each customer’s specific application.
 

Because of its modular construction, the unit is reconfigurable to contain 1 to 16 modules in addition to the bit synchronizer.  Modules are stacked onto the bit synchronizer and decommutator modules in virtually any order, and are bolted together with provided hardware.  The unit is then programmed for the appropriate system configuration.  A variety of mounting configurations are available, and custom mounting can also be provided.

Place of delivery, performance, and acceptance is FOB Destination, Edwards AFB, CA 93524.

T he following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Technical, Past Performance, and Price.  Technical is more important than Past Performance.  Technical and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than Price.  All offers wil l initially be reviewed to determine responsiveness to the solicitation.  TECHNICAL:  The Government will then evaluate the offerors Technical approach to determine if the approach outlined by the offeror meets the minimum Government requirements outlined in the combined synopsis/solicitation, including but not limited to, proposed system hardware and software, system configuration and offered technical solution, the data base development, and the offerors proposed  implementation and maintenance, to includ e warranty and extended warranty terms and conditions.

PRICE:  Those offerors found Technically acceptable with at least a satisfactory history of past performance will then be ranked according  to price.

Realism will be base d on an evaluation of prices to determine if they are compatible with the scope of effort, are not unbalanced, and are neither excessive nor insufficient for the effort to be accomplished.  An unreasonably or unrealistically priced proposal is subject to r emoval from the competitive range on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has submitted an unrealistic proposal.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offeror if that offeror is not technically acceptable, or is judged to have less than satisfactory past performance, based on the information gathered through the questionnaires and other Government and commercial sources, as discussed above.

BACKGROUND:  

The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is seeking proposals (Standard Form 171 or Standard Form 612) from persons interested in providing the PSC services described below.  This is a diverse and politically sensitive program and is one of the few USAID Missions worldwide without a bi-lateral agreement with a host government.  The USAID program for the West Bank and Gaza is a central element of the U.S. government's role in the Palestinian-Israeli peace process. The program supports U.S. interests in promoting regional stability, economic prosperity and adherence to democratic principles.

The last four years of conflict and closures have resulted in significant decline in exports, investment, production, and employment. Current restrictions on movement of people and goods continue to cripple the economy by increasing transaction costs tenfold. These restrictions negatively impact the productive capacity of Palestinian producers and their capacity to increase income and employment.  In addition, the Palestinian Authority continues to be administratively, managerially, and technically weak in the areas of financial and economic management of the economy.  USAID is working to improve this situation.

The United States Agency for International Development for West Bank and Gaza (USAID/WBG) is contracting for one or more technical assistance projects to increase Palestinian trade both with Israel and the rest of the world, as well as to improve the economic management capability of the Palestinian Authority. 

BASIC FUNCTIONS OF THE POSITION: 

This position is located in the Private Enterprise Office (PEO), Strategic Objectives No. Ten (SO10), USAID/West Bank & Gaza, Tel Aviv.  The primary purpose of this position is to serve as the principal advisor to the SO10 team and to the Mission more generally on economic policy and private sector development,  S/he will also serve as Contracting Technical Officer (CTO) for one or more technical assistance projects dealing with trade facilitation, improved public sector economic management, and small enterprise development.

<DESC>Transcripts for Congressional Hearings Solicitation dated August 17, 2005
Amendment No. 3 dated September 1, 2005

Introduction:  The U.S. Department of State released its solicitation for subscription  access to Transcripts of Congressional Hearings on August 17, 2005 and allowed all potential offerors until August 26, 2005 to submit questions about this project.  The purpose of this amendment is to present to potential offerors all questions received by our deadline along with our respective responses.  This amendment No. 3 hereby is made part of our solicitation.


1.  How does the government propose that the contractor receive the audio feed
of the press conference's and congressional hearings?

2.  Will contractor personnel be expected to attend all events from which transcripts are desired or are we to be provided audiotapes of the hearings?

3. If audiotapes of the hearings will be provided, how will we receive them (overnight express, or should we pick it up)?

4. How do we get the transcripts- cassettes, phone in or by FTP from DVR
(Digital Voice Recorders).

Q1-4 Response:  Our office and several hundred world-wide Information Resource Centers require web-based (online), in as close to real time as possible, access to the Contractor's database of transcripts of Congressional hearings and other events as required in the solicitation.  The method the Contractor uses to acquire the transcripts is transparent to the Government.  The Government will not provide audio, tapes, audio feed, etc.  The likely/anticipated effectiveness of the method proposed will be a part of the evaluation of the Offeror’s approach in rating technical proposals.

5.How many lines or minutes of dictation are you anticipating for year

Q5 Response:  unknown

6. Can it be done offshore?  

Q6 Response:  No

7. We have good technical background to do it across the globe and make it web based. Does not having done similar work effect our proposal, if our technical and cost are competitive.

Q7 Response:  An offeror's lack of past performance would not necessarily be held against the offeror.  Such offeror would be rated neutral for that category.  Of course, offerors with positive past performance may receive a superior rating for that category and, ultimately, it could affect award.

8. Who has done the work in past?

Q8 Response:  Most recently, Federal News Service

9. What was the price paid in the past.

Q9 Response:  The Department of State awarded a five-year contract to Federal News Service for a total contract amount of $234,671.95.

10. What has been the number of transcripts, domestic documents, and articles of interest to DOS over the last 3 years? What is the total number of pages?

Q10 Response:  IIP does not keep track of what the individual Information Resource Centers request.  There are nearly 180 IRCs around the world so we have no way of knowing how many of the various kinds of items have been requested.  The requirement is that the vendor should be able to provide whichever of the specified types of items are needed.

11.  During the last 3 years, what has been the number of international documents and articles of interest required by DOS? What is the total number of pages? 

Q11 Response:  see Q10 response.

12. Is the DOS scope of work identified in the current solicitation being performed by an incumbent contractor or other service provide?  If so, would DOS please identify the contractor or service provider?

Q12 Response:  Yes, the incumbent contractor is Federal News Service.

13. Would DOS clarify its expectation for the commencement of contractor performance responsibility? For this scope of work, does DOS anticipate the contractor to capture and secure transcripts and documents through its labor resources?

Q13 Response:  The Contractor will be responsible for determining and accomplishing its own method of obtaining original information from events.  The Government will not be providing audiotapes, audio feed, etc.  The Government needs the resultant transcripts as a web-based database to be available on-line worldwide (our performance requirement).  The method of obtaining the required data, whether by attendance, audio feed, tape, etc. is the responsibility of the contractor.  The likely/anticipated effectiveness of the method chosen/proposed will be a part of the evaluation of the Offeror’s approach in rating technical proposals.

14. Are transcripts provided by other sources to a centralized DOS repository? What is the typical format - email, hard copy, HTML, plain text, pdf, etc? What is the normal formatting requirement of the end-use subscriber? 

Q14 Response:  There is no centralized repository.  IRCs require access to the requested items online.  

15. What is the period for information retention or archival anticipated (1 year, 3 years, 5 years, indefinite)? 

Q15 Response:  The information retention or archiving period is indefinite.

16. For the Cost/Price Proposal Volume, please advise as to the anticipated cost/price structure, i.e. Firm Fixed Price, Cost Plus Fee, Time and Materials, etc.

Q16 Response:  The Department of State contemplates awarding a firm-fixed price for one base year plus options for up to four one-year periods.

17. When does DOS anticipate contract award?

Q17 Response:  The Department of State anticipates contract award will be made in approximately five to six weeks.
