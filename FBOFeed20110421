<DESC>The planned scope is as follows: On a fixed-price basis with a period of performance not to exceed one-year, the contractor shall provide technical and engineering expertise to perform the required analyses and define an Enterprise Architecture (EA); construct the associated Logical Data Model (LDM); and provide the EA and LDM along with related artifacts to the Expeditionary Combat Support System (ECSS) program. The Government is requesting information on the tasks of systems and business analysis, architecture definition and design, and information engineering related to the creation of an Enterprise Architecture (EA) design and associated Logical Data Model (LDM).  To satisfy these needs, the Government is interested in the use of industry standard tools and techniques that can leverage existing analysis and design results in the creation and delivery of the needed analysis and design artifacts.  The LDM must use an industry standard modeling technique, such as IDEF! 1X.  The Air Force currently uses the ERWIN product from Computer Associates to document much of the legacy systems data, however, the IBM System Architect (SA) product has been selected to support the creation and management of the EA and LDM artifacts requested in this effort.

<DESC>FAB-T Alternate SourceReference Number FA 8307-11-R-0005This is not a solicitation. This synopsis is being issued to conduct market research for informational and planning purposes regarding a potential alternative source for the Air Force Family of Advanced Beyond-Line-of-Sight Terminals (FAB-T) Program. The FAB-T program provides Beyond-Line-of-Sight satellite communications (SATCOM) terminals with an open architecture to satisfy the requirements identified in the FAB-T Capability Requirements Summary.  The FAB-T program will deliver ground and aircraft qualified terminals with the capability to move large amounts of information to and from ground installations and airborne platforms. Capabilities include transmission and reception of voice, data, imagery, and video as well as broadcast reception over protected SATCOM systems. The Government will be releasing draft RFP documents incrementally. The initial release consists of this introduction along with drafts of the Statement Of Objectives (SOO), Preliminary Work Breakdown Schedule (PWBS), and Government Technical Requirements Document (GTRD).  More documents will follow.  These are being released for Industry review to gather comments and suggestions from potential offerors and promote a clearer understanding of the requirements by industry.  The Government will consider all comments received and may revise documents based on those comments.This synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposals (RFP) nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice nor will it reimburse firms for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. An ESC Ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition.  Before consulting the Ombudsman concerned parties should first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendation to the Contracting Officer for resolution.  In addition, AFFARS 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, will be included in an acquisition solicitation or contract, as applicable.  The ESC Ombudsman can be contacted at:  ESC Ombudsman, Building 1606, 9 Eglin Street, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731; Telephone #:  781-377-5106; Facsimile #:  781-377-4659; E-Mail:  ESC.Ombudsman@hanscom.af.mil.We remind companies interested in this effort in any capacity (e.g., prime contractor, subcontractor, or teaming arrangement) of their responsibility to ensure they address and take steps to avoid and/or mitigate potential Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) issues.  This is especially important if a company is presently supporting the Government through an Advisory and Assistance Services contract.  Guidance is found in FAR Part 9 - Contractor Qualifications, and possibly OCI clauses in other Government contracts your company may have.Companies should contact the Contracting Officer, Mr. Scott Maitland, ESC/HNSK, 5 Eglin Street, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731-2100, (781) 271-5213, Scott.Maitland@hanscom.af.mil with any questions you may have on this matter.When corresponding with the Contracting Officer please send copies to the following:Christofer P.

<DESC>Solicitation Number:<br />SPM8E3-11-R-0009<br /><br />Notice Type:<br />Presolicitation (draft)<br /><br />Synopsis:<br /><br />The Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support Activity, within the Department of Defense, is hereby generating the DRAFT solicitation to the Maintenance, Repair and Operations (MRO) CENTCOM Tailored Logistics Support program. The purpose of this initiative is to establish the third generation program for the United States Central Command Area of Responsibility (CENTCOM AOR) for logistics support of military installations, federal agencies, and other authorized customers within the geographic area. It is anticipated to continue the Tailored Logistics Support Program under an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract for MRO materials. The contract term of this action is a two year base to include a 60 day "ramp-up" (if necessary) with two eighteen month unilateral option periods. Offer on the option portion is mandatory. A minimum of three and a maximum of four contracts are anticipated to the highest rated offers utilizing Source Selection procedures. All resulting orders will be competed with those awardees. <br /><br />Best Value Source Selection Method/Tradeoff Process will be utilized with technical factors being more important than price. However, as proposals become more equal in their technical ratings, the evaluated price becomes more important. Technical Factors: Technical Merit (with subfactors), Past Performance, and Socioeconomic Considerations. Solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis allowing all firms, both large and small businesses, to offer. <br /><br />Attachment ONE contains a "Core list" of 500 frequently used items and is as a representative sample of the items to be included in the basic solicitation. There may be minor modifications to the core list prior to issuing the final solicitation. For the final solicitation, initial pricing for the 500 core list items will serve as the ceiling price for the first six months of the base period. Items subject to more pricing volatility will be so identified and have the pricing fixed as a ceiling price for the first three months of the base period. Offerors will also have to submit pricing for the 500 core list items for each option period. Subsequently, pricing for the 500 core list items will serve as the ceiling price for the first six months of each option period, and items identified as subject to more pricing volatility will have the pricing fixed as a ceiling price for the first three months of each option period. Vendors will need to provide end unit pricing to three different locations: Kandahar, Bagram and Other (War Zone/FOB's).
<p>At this time, DLA Troop Support MRO welcomes your comments to the draft solicitation. Written comments shall be received (via e-mail) and addressed to: joseph.marquis@dla.mil or Cecilia.lucente@dla.mil on or before May 6, 2011 and may be considered for inclusion in the final CENTCOM solicitation. DO NOT SUBMIT A PROPOSAL as NO evaluations will be conducted at this time. The government will not issue direct responses to vendor comments or questions. If submitting comments, make reference to the specific page and text of this draft RFP. Due to the anticipated level of interest, DLA Troop Support will not entertain individual requests for contractor visits or marketing calls.</p>

<DESC>NASA Headquarters has a requirement to continue work under the HeadquartersInformation Technology Support Services (HITSS) contract NNH06CC93B with InDyne, Inc. HITSS supports Headquarters in the following areas: IT and Management Support,Applications Development and Web Site Development and Maintenance, Systems Engineeringand Integration, NASA Headquarters Computer Center and Telecommunications Services,Customer Services, and IT Security. NASA intends to award a sole-source contract extension, for up to an additional six (6)months through November 30, 2011, to InDyne, Inc. pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1),Only One Responsible Source.  This extension will allow for a continuation of currentwork and new work until the HITSS competitive follow-on contract is awarded.  The HITSSfollow-on RFP was released on April 8, 2011 and proposals are due on May 9, 2011.The contract extension is necessary to ensure the continuity of IT support services toNASA Headquarters.  IT support is a mission critical function to all Headquarters MissionDirectorate and Mission Support Offices.  Headquarters provides overall guidance anddirection to the Agency and as such this extension is necessary to avoid significantadverse impacts to the Agency in carrying out the NASA mission.A sole-source award to InDyne for the contract extension is necessary due to the natureand urgency of the work performed under this contract and the fact that we are conductinga competitive follow-on procurement.  InDyne has the combined training, experience andexpertise to provide uninterrupted continuation of mission critical IT support.  Shouldthese services be interrupted NASA Headquarters will be unable to utilize theHeadquarters IT infrastructure and systems required for providing leadership andmanagement to the Agency.  If NASA Headquarters attempts to procure these services fromany other source for this interim period, it will cause impacts in fulfilling NASAsmission due to the additional time needed for any other source to reach the current levelof expertise of InDyne.  Because of the time in procuring and planning another contract,InDyne is considered the only contractor that can meet NASAs needs given the short termof the extension.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing, via e-mail, to the identified point of contact not later than 4:00 PMlocal time on May 6, 2011.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely forthe purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurmenet on a competitivebasis.

<RESPDATE>052511
<ARCHDATE>04212012
<CONTACT>Dr. Karl F. Roenigk, Program Manager, Email dni-iarpa-baa-11-06@ugov.gov
<DESC><strong>SYNOPSIS<br /></strong>The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) will host a Proposers' Day Conference for the Synthetic Holographic Observation (SHO) Program on June 2, 2011, in anticipation of the release of a new solicitation in support of the program. The Conference will be held from 8:30 am to 3:30 pm in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. The purpose of the conference will be to provide information on the SHO Program to address questions from potential proposers and to provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.
<p>This announcement serves as a pre-solicitation notice and is issued solely for information and planning purposes. The Proposers' Day Conference does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Conference attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to future solicitations (if any) associated with this program.</p>
<p><strong>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND GOALS<br /></strong>GEOINT analysts work with massive quantities of dynamic 3D data to produce vital insights within operational timelines. These 3D data come from a wide variety of sources including LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar), stereo from imagery, and digital terrain models. The 3D data are also frequently fused with other types of data (such as multispectral imagery) to create rich representations of geographic regions and situations of interest. Analysts require visualization solutions that enable them to work interactively and collaboratively with these naturally 3D data in fast-paced operational settings for prolonged periods.</p>
<p>3D viewing technologies used today by analysts of 3D data are generally based on the high-performance graphics capabilities available in desktop computers. These can provide what appears to be a compelling view of 3D data on a 2D screen. However, the visual representations are typically unnatural to the visual senses, which limits extended use. Shortcomings derive in large part from the artificial rendering of depth and perspective which often leads to uncomfortable levels of discontinuity between angular views, and disorientation due to depth-cue mismatch. Most consumer technologies require eye-wear for each viewer, but typically provide only a single perspective of a 3D scene to all viewers (e.g., video games, movies). There are also approaches that provide dynamic perspectives, albeit to a single viewer who has some mobility around the display, using eye-wear and head-tracking. Attempts to provide single views without eye-wear generally suffer from excessive cross-talk between left and right eyes and constrain the viewer to a stationary viewing position. In sum, current 3D viewing technologies are inadequate to support the growing visualization needs of analysts working interactively and collaboratively with naturally 3D data.<br /><br />Emerging holographic 3D display technologies, while technically immature and high-risk, offer the potential to directly address the critical human factors issues to provide natural, interactive 3D viewing of 3D data sets. The SHO Program goals are derived from the state-of-art in potential component technologies (e.g., light sources, optical materials, Hogel-based rendering engines) and also from the human factors challenges faced by analysts who work for long periods with massive and naturally 3D data. The SHO Program plans to create low profile, brilliant, power-efficient, high resolution and full color synthetic holographic 3D display systems that present dynamic 3D data with no flicker, no color break-up, and in a manner that is simultaneously viewable by multiple analysts with the unaided eye. Human factors will be addressed throughout the program to enable sustained viewing that is natural to the senses without discomfort. Further, we anticipate the creation of powerful new software applications for analysts as the ability to work naturally in 3D removes many of the cognitive inefficiencies of today's systems.<br /><br />Collaborative efforts/teaming among potential performers are strongly encouraged. It is anticipated that teams will be multidisciplinary with personnel such as display technologists, materials scientists, computer scientists, and human factors experts.<br /><br />IARPA anticipates that universities and companies from around the world will participate in this program. Researchers will be able to and are encouraged to publish their findings in publicly available, academic journals.</p>
<p><strong>REGISTRATION INFORMATION<br /></strong>Attendees must register no later than 5:00pm Eastern May 25, 2011 at<br />https://conference.brtrc.com/SHO_pd/Overview.aspx. Directions to the conference facility and other materials are available on the website. No walk-in registrations will be allowed.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations, attendance will be limited to the first 140 registrants and to no more than 2 representatives per organization. All attendees will be required to present a government-issued photo identification to enter the conference. Non-US citizens will be required to submit a visit request form for Foreign Nationals at least 5 business days prior to the conference. The form and submission instructions can be found on the registration website.</p>
<p><strong>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<br /></strong>Attendees who wish to present organization capabilities for potential teaming opportunities may request to do so by sending an e-mail along with their presentation to dni-iarpa-baa-11-06@ugov.gov. Presentations will be limited to 5 minutes with a maximum of 5 slides (MS PowerPoint or PDF format). Opportunities to present will be limited by time and will therefore be on a first-to-ask basis. Deadline for requests is close of business (5:00pm Eastern) May 25, 2011. It is the presenter's responsibility to ensure that all materials briefed are appropriately marked and approved for presentation by their organization. The IARPA Program Manager will review and approve all presentations.</p>
<p>This Proposers' Day is intended for participants who are eligible to compete on the anticipated BAA. Other Government Agencies, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs) will not be eligible to submit proposals to the anticipated BAA nor participate as team members under proposals submitted by eligible entities. While such entities are not prohibited from attending the Proposers' Day, due to space limitations, preference will be given first to those organizations that are eligible to compete.</p>
<p>IARPA will not provide reimbursement for costs incurred to participate in this conference.</p>
<p>Questions concerning conference &amp; registration can be sent to dni-iarpa-events@ugov.gov.</p>

<DESC>FedBiz Synopsis for F414 Kit Procurement
<p><br />The Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Contracts Department, Patuxent River, MD in support of NAVAIR 4.4, Propulsion and Power, intends to negotiate a delivery order under Basic Ordering Agreement FA8122-09-G-0001 on a sole source basis with General Electric, 1000 Western Ave, Lynn, MA 01902 for material and parts (186 kits) to reduce high cyclic stresses identified during flight test of an instrumented main fuel manifold. These kits will reduce the likelihood of cracking events of the lower main fuel manifold near the inlet tee on the gooseneck. The damper brackets lower the cyclic stress below the HCF design limit. The Government intends to procure under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. General Electric is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and the only contractor with the requisite knowledge and experience of the F414 Main Fuel Manifold stress environment and required design changes to mitigate those stresses. The estimated period of performance for this acquisition is 12 months. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS; however, responsible interested parties may submit information in which they can identify interest and capability to respond to this requirement. Responses must be received by 17:00 PM Eastern Time on 5 May 2011. The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is: 336412-Aircraft Engine and Engine Parts Manufacturing. The Government reserves the right to process the procurement on a sole source basis based upon the responses received. The Government will not pay for any information received. The point of contact is T. C. Renner Jr., Contract Specialist, via E-mail: thomas.c.renner@navy.mil or by fax at (301) 757-9046.</p>

<DESC>ALL INFORMATION NEEDED FOR INTERESTED PARTIES TO SUBMIT A STANDARD FORM (SF) 330, ARCHITECT-ENGINEER QUALIFCATIONS, IS CONTAINED HEREIN.  THERE IS NO RFP PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD.

Engineering and Design Services are required for an Indefinite Quantity Contract for various projects funded by the Government of Japan (GoJ) direct cash contributions (or otherwise referred to as the Mamizu funds) for the development of infrastructure and facilities covered by the Defense Policy Review Initiative (DPRI).    NAVFAC Pacific is the Department of Defense's Executive Agent for Construction on Guam and is the designated design and construction agent for the DPRI associated with the rebasing of approximately 8,000 Marines and their dependents from Okinawa to Guam.

The contract coverage is in Guam, U.S.A.
  Planned projects include, but are not limited to, new construction and repair and alteration of base development facilities (including, but not limited to, barracks, dormitories, administrative facilities, and police stations).

Architect-Engineering and Engineering Services required under this contract include, but are not limited to, the preparation of project engineering documentation, DD 1391s, preliminary and final plans and specifications including preparation of Design-Build (DB) Request for Proposal (RFP) contract documents or Design Bid Build (DBB) contract documents, technical reports including engineering investigations and concept studies, preparation of facilities concept studies, facilities analysis concept development (FACD/charettes), construction cost estimates, operations and maintenance manuals, record drawings, shop drawing reviews, redi-check reviews and construction consultation and geotechnical investigations as required for design, analysis and studies.
  Other support services may include post-construction award services; construction surveillance and inspection services; operational and maintenance support information services; and other miscellaneous post-construction award services.

All work shall be performed in accordance with applicable Federal, State, and local policy, guidance, regulations, and laws including, but not limited to the Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) Design Procedures, MIL-HDBK-1190 Facility and Planning Design Guide, UFC 4-010-01 DoD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings, and UFC 3-600-01 Fire Protection Engineering for Facilities. 

NAVFAC Pacific currently uses the following software applications: WINDOWS XP Workstation, Microsoft Office 2007 Professional (Word 2007, Powerpoint 2007, Excel 2007, Access 2007, Project 2007), Adobe Acrobat 8 Professional, and AutoDesk's AutoCAD 2006.
  In accordance with the contract or task order statement of work, the contractor shall complete necessary tasks and submittals or submit various reports to the Government that are readily useable in these applications without further adjustments.  

Evaluation and selection will be based on the most highly qualified firm upon evaluation of the selection criteria stated herein.  The A-E must demonstrate their and each key consultant's qualifications with respect to the published selection criteria for all services.  Selection criteria 1 through 9 are listed below in descending order of importance.  Specific selection criteria include:

1.  Specialized Experience: 

Firm's demonstrated recent experience with regard to design of base development facilities including performing Design Charrettes/Functional Analysis Concept Developments (FACD) and preparation of design-build and design-bid-build contract documents similar in size, complexity, and dollar value (approximately $50-100 million or more in construction value [FY09 dollars] per project/contract).
  Base development facilities include, but are not limited to, barracks, dormitories, administrative facilities, and police stations.  Individual features (barracks, dormitories, administrative facilities, and police stations) do not have to be within a single project scope; however, projects that contain several or all features may be given more favorable consideration than projects that contain only individual features.  Also, base development projects designed and constructed in environments similar to Guam (remoteness, corrosiveness, etc.) will be considered more favorably.  List a maximum of ten (10) relevant projects completed in the past ten (10) years which best describe experience in design of base development projects discussed above.
  A project or contract is defined as either a stand-alone contract or a single task order in an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract having the features described above.

2.  Professional Qualifications and Technical Competence of the Individual Design Team Members.  Key personnel are identified as the Principal/Program Manager and Project Managers in the following disciplines:  Architectural, Structural, Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, Fire Protection, and Geotechnical.  Limit submission to not more than ten (10) key personnel including the Principal/Program Manager, the Project Managers for each of the seven major disciplines described above, and two other key personnel deemed by the firm to be most important to the success of the team.
  For all 10 key personnel, explain the scope of responsibilities in the proposed organization and how the firm's organizational construct is most appropriate considering effectiveness and cost factors.

a.  Active U.S. professional registration or equivalent qualifications (i.e. APEC and other similar professional certifications will be considered in the evaluation).  Note:  During contract execution, U.S. registration will be required for all engineers who approve designs, in their registered discipline(s).

b.  Past experience in the types of work described in Evaluation Factor 1 or evidence of similar relevant experience (with present and other firms) and roles of staff members specifically in design of base development projects described in Evaluation Factor 1.
  Provide up to a maximum of five (5) relevant projects for each key person.  A project or contract is defined as either a stand-alone contract or a single task order in an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract having the features described above.

3.  Past Performance:  Firms will be evaluated on past performance with respect to work quality, compliance with schedules, cost control (with emphasis on projects addressed in Evaluation Factor (1)), and cooperation and responsiveness.  Firms should include any letters of commendation or awards.  Firms will also be evaluated on performance evaluations obtained from the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS).
  

4.  Ability to perform the work in the required time and capacity to accomplish a variation of taskings simultaneously.

5.  Sustainable Design:  Firms will be evaluated in terms of their knowledge and demonstrated experience in applying sustainability concepts through an integrated design approach and designing in accordance with the U.S. Green Building Council, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System or equivalent.  Provide up to a maximum of five (5) projects that have attained or been submitted for LEED certification.  For projects not yet certified, identify the date the project was submitted.  For all projects, identify the team's major contribution(s), design elements/features/equipment/etc., in attainment of the certification.

6.
  Quality Control Program:  Firms will be evaluated on the acceptability of their internal quality control program used to ensure technical accuracy and discipline coordination of plans and specifications.  List responsible key personnel. 

7.  Extent to which firms identify and commit to small business (SB), small disadvantaged business (SDB), women-owned small business (WOSB), historically underutilized business zone small business (HUBZoneSB), historically black college or university and minority institution (HBCU/MI) and veteran-owned small business (VOSB), and service disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) in performance of this contract, whether as a joint venture, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor.
  Identify each sub consultant by name, discipline and size status and also identify, in terms of dollar values and percentage of total proposed price, the extent of work you will perform as the prime contractor.

NAVFAC's FY10 subcontracting targets in terms of dollar value of subcontracts are 65.65% to SB, 16.27% to SDB, 14.68% to WOSB, 1.37% to HUBZone SB, and 3.0% to SDVOSB.  FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small, Small  Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Small Business concerns states in part; the Contractor hereby agrees to carry out this policy in the awarding of subcontracts to the fullest extent consistent with efficient contract performance.  In order to receive proposal evaluation benefit as HUBZone SB either as prime or sub consultant, proposed HUBZoneSBs must be certified by the Small Business Administration.
  Prime contractors may determine whether a prospective sub consultant is a certified HUBZone by accessing the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov.  

8.  Firm's location in the general geographical area of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the contract. 

9.  Volume of Work:  Firms will be evaluated in terms of work previously awarded to the firm by the Department of Defense (DOD) within the past 12 months with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of DOD A&E contracts among qualified A&E firms, including small and small disadvantaged business firms and firms that have not had prior DOD contracts.

Include the following items in Section H, Block 30 of the SF 330:  (1) a summary of qualifications in narrative discussion addressing each of the above selection evaluation criteria, (2) an organization chart  of the proposed team showing the names and roles of all key personnel listed in Section E with the associated firm as listed in Section C, (3) your DUNS, CAGE, and TIN numbers, and (4) evidence that your firm is permitted by law to practice the professions of architecture or engineering, i.e., State registration number.

The planned contract type is an Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract where work will be ordered via task orders on an as-needed basis during the life of the contract provided the Government and the contractor agree on the amount.
    Each task order will be a firm fixed price A-E contract.   The duration of the contract will be for one (1) year from the date of initial contract award with four (4) additional one-year option periods.  The total amount that may be paid under this contract (including option years) will not exceed $50,000,000 for the entire contract term.  The options may be exercised within the time frame specified in the resultant contract at the sole discretion of the Government subject to workload and/or satisfaction of the A-E performance under the subject contract.  There will be no synopsis in the event the options are exercised.  The minimum guarantee for the entire contract term (including option years) is $50,000.
  There will be no dollar limit per task order and no dollar limit per year.  No other general notification to firms for other similar projects performed under this contract will be made.  Estimated award timeframe is May 2011.   This proposed contract is being solicited on an unrestricted basis.  

All contractors are advised that registration in the DOD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database is required prior to award of a contract.  Failure to register in the DOD CCR Database may render your firm ineligible for award.  For more information, check the DOD CCR Website at http://www.ccr.gov.

The duration of the contract will be for one (1) year from the date of initial contract award; with two (2) additional one year option periods.  The total amount that may be paid under this contract, including option years, will not exceed $5,000,000.  The Government guarantees a minimum of $10,000 for the contract term.  The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered.  Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  In the event the estimated annual fee is not met, the Government reserves the right to carry-over any unused capacity to the following option year(s).  Additionally, the Government reserves the right to obligate more than $1,666,667 in any contract year.
  The options may be exercised at the discretion of the Government subject to workload and/or satisfaction of the A&E performance under the subject contract.  

This proposed contract is being solicited as a 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE to only small business concerns.  The North American Industry Classification system (NAICS) for this contract is 541330.  The prime firm and consultants for each contract will be required to perform throughout the contract term (including option years, if implemented).  The small business size standard classification for this procurement is $4,500,000.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, Florida intends to solicit Concurrent Technology Inc, 6 Tower Office Park, Woburn, MA, 01801 on a sole source basis for a firm fixed price type indefinite delivery indefinite quantity requirements type contract for quantities, up to seventy-two (72) each of Dual PMC Carrier Boards (part number PP PMC/202-05EU); up  to seventy-two (72) each of PP402 Processor Card (part number PP 402/041-25E); up to seventy-two (72) each of Compact Flash Retaining Bracket (part number KT BKT/001-00) and up to seventy-two (72) 2.5 SATA Hard Drive Mounting Kit (part number AD 110/001-71).  These items are commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and any quantities, up to the previously stated amounts, may be procured under delivery orders issued against the resultant contract.
  All prices will be evaluated at the time of award.   

This action is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons: The parts being procured are slightly modified COTS items manufactured by Concurrent Technologies Inc of Woburn, MA.  The end items being purchased were specifically tested and evaluated against the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) technical requirements as provided in the Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) Service Life Extension (SLEP) Programs Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Navigation (C4N) System Baseline Configuration 3 (SBC3) hardware requirements specification during the products formal qualification to ensure 100% compatibility with the LCAC C4N SBC3 system.
  Currently, no other source meets the form, fit, function, and interchangeability requirements for the LCAC C4N SBC3 system without redesigning the C4N system.  Other COTS items would require development and extensive engineering and environmental testing efforts which would not meet the known deliverable dates for procurement.  Therefore, it is in the Governments best interest to purchase these items from Concurrent Technologies Inc.  Delivery will be made to the Receiving Officer, Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD), 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City FL 32407.  

Interested offeror(s) may submit request(s) for qualification on future requirements via e-mail to Contract Specialist  Tim Reed at tim.e.reed1@navy.mil by 2 May 2011.
  Requests must be marked with this synopsis designation number and should include the offerors name, address, telephone number, commercial and government entity (CAGE) code, point of contact, and clearly identify the offerors capabilities.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely with the discretion of the Government.  

NAICS Code 423430 applies.  SBA Size Standard is 100 employees.  FSC is 5999.

<DESC>The Naval Inventory Control Point plans to award a 5-year Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) for the repair of 13 line components of the Generator Converter Unit (GCU) used on the F/A-18 E-G aircraft.  GE Aviation Systems LLC (35012), Clearwater, FL, is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and the only known source to possess full repair capability.  Complete data, drawings and the rights to the same are not available from the Government.   The contractor must have a Commercial Service Agreement (CSA) with the Fleet Readiness Center (FRC) and be able to maintain CORE logistics capability. The following are the top 3 high dollar value items for repair:  Alternating Generator, NSN 6115-01-545-2670, P/N FH30001G3; Alternating Generator, NSN 6115-01-566-4393, P/N FH30000G6; Circuit Card Assembly, NSN 5998-01-545-2661, P/N FV29420G5.
  For a complete list of all items to be repaired or any questions concerning this notice, contact the PCO, Melissa Fisher at (215) 697-5844.

The subject items require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.  Only the source previously approved by the Government for repair of these items will be solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the NAVICP Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair.
  This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in repair of the same or similar items. This brochure can be obtained at https://www.navsup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navicp/business_opps or by calling the NAVICP PCO.  If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval.  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT
Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the Naval War College, College of Distance Education, intends to award a sole source Firm-Fixed Price contract to Professors to Go.  Under the authority of USC 2304(c) (1) pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a) (2), the product or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source or only from a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract is based on market research and is solely within the discretion of the government.  
Even though a Firm-Fixed Price/Sole Source Contract is anticipated, interested firms or persons may identify their interest and capability to the Contracting Officer, Ginny Reedenauer, at (401) 841-6022, Email: ginny.reedenauer@usnwc.edu.
A determination by the Contracting Officer not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this Notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Pearl Harbor, HI  Joint Maritime Operations

The courses are essentially the same as taught in residence at Newport, with the CDE resident faculty preparing the course syllabus, procuring teaching materials, and funding administrative expenses.
  Because the site of the courses is removed from the Naval War College (NWC) it is necessary to contract individuals who reside in these areas to serve as an instructor and local administrator for the courses.  The qualifications for this position are unique in that they require a combination of professional education, naval warfare operational experience, a familiarity with Naval War College missions and functions, and competence in teaching at the graduate level, using the NWC methodology.

The following Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities specific to each course apply:

Strategy & War  
Ph.D. in Military History, History, Political Science, or International Relations  Desired	
Joint Professional Military Education Phase 1  Desired
Teaching experience in an accredited institution of higher education  Desired

PROCEDURES FOR SOLICITATION/AWARD
A written Request for Quotation (RFQ) #N00124-11-T-0192 (Form SF 1449) will be issued in 3-5 business after this Notice posting.  Interested parties may obtain a copy of this SF 1449 from the FedBizOpps or NECO website or by contacting Ginny Reedenauer at ginny.reedenauer@usnwc.edu.  Even though the intent is for a sole source contract, all responsible sources may submit a quotation which be considered by the agency.
  The government will award a firm fixed price GSA Task Order or Purchase Order resulting from this RFQ to the responsible offeror whose quotation represents the Best Value to the government.  Evaluation factors to be considered will be cost/price, experience and past performance.  The government considers experience/past performance to be more important than price.  However, the government will not select an offeror for award on the basis of relatively superior capability without concern for cost/price.  The relative impact the experience/past performance and price will have on the source selection decision will depend in part on the degree of differences among the competing offerors.

The Line Items on the Request for Quotation may be segregated into smaller requirements for the purpose of awarding more than one contract.
  Therefore, vendors are encouraged to quote on either all or some of the line items listed.  It will be up to the discretion of the contracting officer whether or not issuing multiple contracts will be in the best interest of the government.  

The award date is estimated to be no later than June 10, 2011

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>Description:</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) Art in Architecture Program commissions American artists (citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents or Permanent Workers of the United States) to create publicly scaled and permanently installed artworks for federal buildings nationwide.</p>
<p>GSA announces an opportunity for a federal art commission in conjunction with the construction of the New United States Courthouse in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Description of Project:</p>
<p>The proposed new 262,000 square-foot United States Courthouse will be constructed on the site at corner of N. 6th and Reily Streets which is bounded by Reily Street, N. 7th Street, Harris Street and N. 6th Street. The 6 to 8 story building will include the United States District, Magistrate, and Bankruptcy Courts, the United States District and Bankruptcy Court Clerks, United States Probation, United States Marshals Service, United States Attorneys, United States Trustees, Federal Public Defender and the GSA. The space will include four (4) District Courtrooms, two (2) Magistrate Courtrooms, one(1) Bankruptcy Courtroom and associated supporting spaces, such as judge's chambers, jury deliberation facilities, jury assembly, and grand jury suites, holding cells, etc. Office space will be provided for the U.S. agencies noted previously. The project will include approximately 43 interior secure parking spaces. The building will apply for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) gold certification.<br /><br />GSA allocates one-half of one percent of the estimated construction costs of new or modernized federal buildings for art commissions. The art budget for the new Courthouse project in Harrisburg currently estimated to be $590,000.00.&nbsp; One or more artists will be awarded a fixed-price contract for a commission.</p>
<p>Artists who wish to be considered for this and all future GSA art commissions must submit application materials to GSA's National Artists Registry (Registry). The Registry constitutes the qualified list of artists for this and all GSA commissions. Instructions on how to join the Registry are available on the following Web site:</p>

<p>All artists who wish to be considered as candidates for a commission at the U.S. Courthouse in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, must have their application materials submitted and received to the Registry by 3:00 PM Eastern Time on May 27, 2011. Artists' submissions received after the deadline will not be considered for the U.S. Courthouse in Harrisburg, but will be eligible for consideration on future GSA commissions alongside the other artists on the Registry. Artists already on the Registry need not resubmit, but may elect to update their information prior to the deadline.</p>
<p>GSA evaluates artists based on the following technical criteria: the media, materials, content, style, and scope of the artist's past work, along with the artist's past performance and experience with commissions or projects similar to the one described in this synopsis. Short-listed artists will be contacted and asked to submit additional information including a statement that he or she can perform the work associated with the GSA commission within the identified budget. GSA will count the combined weight of all the technical selection criteria as significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the scope of services for this commission will require: collaboration with the lead designer selected for the building project; development of preliminary and final concepts; fabrication of the artwork; participation in meetings and conservation reviews as necessary; and the installation of the artwork at the project site.</p>

                                                Requirement:
The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Grand Forks, North Dakota.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 6,417 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 5,580 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (ABOA). The lease term requirement is for five (5) years. The space must be available for occupancy by October 1, 2011.

The Government will require 5 reserved parking spaces.

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

Please send expressions of interest to:
Rachel Shanahan
UGL Services-Equis Operations
8350 E. Crescent Parkway, Suite 300
Greenwood Village, CO 80111
Rachel.Shanahan@na.ugllimited.com
Direct: 303-729-2342

Expressions of Interest must be submitted to the above address by 4:00 p.m. MST on May 6, 2011, and must include the following information:

 Building name and address and location of the available space within the building.
 Rentable square feet available and expected rental rate per rentable square foot, fully serviced.

 Date of space availability.
 Method of rentable space measurement.
 Building ownership information.
 Amount of parking available on-site and its costs. Include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the Government required parking (if any).

<DESC>The authorized Federal Navigation Project for the lower Kennebec River consists of a channel, 27 feet deep and 500 feet wide extending from the river mouth near Popham Beach to a point about 13 miles upstream at the city of Bath.<br><br>The New England District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is proposing to perform maintenance dredging of two portions (and advance maintenance dredging in one of those two portions) of the Federal project in the Kennebec River in the summer of 2011.  Dredging is needed to remove dangerous shoals from the channel in advance of the transit of the U.S. Navy Destroyer, the "SPRUANCE", currently scheduled to depart the Bath Iron Works (BIW) on or about September 1, 2011 on its way to being commissioned.  The SPRUANCE has been deemed critical to national defense and its transit from the BIW cannot be delayed.  We are proposing to perform maintenance dredging in the vicinity of Doubling Point (just below Bath) and at the mouth of the river near Popham Beach. We estimate that a total of about 70,000 cubic yards (i.e. 60,000 cubic yards from Doubling Point and 10,000 cubic yards from Popham Beach) of clean sandy material needs to be removed from the channel.  The shoals in the Doubling Point area consist of massive sand-waves oscillating within vertical and horizontal ranges; the elevation at the tips of these sand-waves vary from -19.7' to  -26.8'.  As part of this proposal, advance maintenance may be performed to remove the sand-waves in the vicinity of Doubling Point to a maximum elevation of -32' in an effort to improve the chance that adequate depths will endure.  The estimated quantity mentioned above (i.e. 60,000 cubic yards) includes advance maintenance dredging.  The proposed work will be performed with a hopper dredge over a three to five week period beginning on or about August 1, 2011.  The material dredged from the Doubling Point area will be disposed of at the previously used in-river disposal site located north of Bluff Head in about 95 to 100 feet of water.  Material dredged from the Popham Beach area will be disposed at a previously used 500-yard circular near-shore disposal site located about 0.4 nautical miles south of Jackknife Ledge in depths of about 40 to 50 feet.  Maintenance dredging is contingent upon the availability of the necessary approvals and funding.  <br><br>We anticipate that plans and specifications will be available around mid to late May 2011 and will be available for downloading by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities website (http:/www.fbo.gov).  In order to view this solicitation, prospective contractors are required to self register their firm with Federal Business Opportunities (go to http:/fbo.gov and register under Vendor/Citizen).  Amendments, if any, to his solicitation will be made available at the http:/www.fbo.gov website.  Neither telephonic, mailed nor faxed requests will be accepted.  Registrants are responsible for the accuracy of the information on the FedBizOps Registration List.<br><br>This is being issued as an unrestricted procurement.  The estimated cost of the contract is between $1,000,000 to $1,500,000.  The applicable NAICS code is 237990.  Any responsible source meeting this standard may submit a proposal to be considered by the New England District.   <br>

QUALITY ASSURANCE & DAILY REPORTS<br>10.	FINAL REPORT<br>11.  OPTION 1<br><br>BIDDING SCHEDULE<br>INTRODUCTION<br>The Gavins Point Dam Intake structure contains a deicing bubbler system to maintain open water around the structure during winter months.  Operation of the system prevents ice-load stresses on the structures and clogging of the trash racks due to ice formation.  A number of nozzles are known to be clogged or possibly damaged resulting in freeze up of the emergency gate and service gate slots.  Dive work will be required within this scope.  Cleaning the nozzles in the emergency gate and service gate slots will require divers to lower from a contractor supplied hoisting assembly that will be placed across the top of each opening. Cleaning of four nozzles in each slot located downstream of the trash racks will not be required due to their inaccessibility.  Cleaning will involve removal of flanged air nozzle assemblies and bringing the nozzles to the surface for cleaning such as drill-brushing the 1/2 line and 1/8 orifice in the nozzle. Brushing the inside of the 1/2 supply line to each nozzle will also be required.  <br>1.	DESCRIPTION<br>1.1	General: The deicing system consists of air compressors, receivers, and compressor valving/controls located in the structures.  The flanged air nozzle assemblies are attached to an anchor flange with four (4) 1/2-13NC-2 thread bolts.    <br>1.2	The Intake Structure consists of nine intake slots and a total of 102 nozzles to be cleaned.    <br>1.3	See attached drawings for specifics.

<DESC><p>Little Rock AFB is conducting market research to determine the availability, interest and capability of potential small business sources qualified and able to compete for a contract to perform the Integrated Solid Waste Management service requirements at Little Rock AFB, Arkansas. The information in this notice is based on the best and most current information available to date. This information is subject to change and is not binding to the Government. Updated information will be provided in future announcements and posted electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities homepage at www.fbo.gov. The Government shall not reimburse the costs of preparing responses to this request for information/sources sought notice.</p>
<p>The 19th Contracting Squadron (AMC), Little Rock Air Force Base (AFB), Arkansas, intends to issue a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) in the May/June 2011 timeframe for the acquisition of Integrated Solid Waste Management services to be performed at Little Rock AFB.

<p>19 CONS is interested in quantifying and pre-qualifying the likelihood of setting aside competition for Integrated Solid Waste Management services for Little Rock AFB to a small business. Depending upon the response to this notice and other market research, 19 CONS may limit the competition to a specific category of small business at the exclusion of all other potential business concerns.

<p>This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.

  Statement of Work 
 
A Contract Telecom Technician is required 40 hours a week for maintenance and repair of analog and digital telephone systems and equipment, at a tertiary-care, Veterans Health Administration, VISN9, Medical Center Hospital.  Due to Federal security requirements, a thorough background check of the individual who will occupy this position is essential.  Certification of background-check passage for the individual who will fill this position must be provided by the Contracting Company that employs that individual, and must be done at that company's expense. Because this is a Hospital environment, consisting of Out-Patient Clinics, Emergency Room, Urgent Care, Acute In-Patient Care, Nursing Home, and Domiciliary Care, as well as Administrative and Business Office facilities, no lapse of current service levels is acceptable.

The individual Telecom Technician who will occupy this position, must be an individual who is very proficient in the repair and replacement of analog and digital telephones, as well as creating those telephones by programming (or reprogramming) a Fujitsu  9600 XL  PBX system using  Fortran Corporation's  Siteman, EMMl  - Server/Monitor System (V 2.0) for telephone switch management and call accounting. This individual also becomes a System Administrator of the noted PBX as well as the Siteman  server, a Fujitsu  Intellicenter  ACD server, a Captaris  CallXpress  Voice Mail server, and a Captaris  RightFax server.  This individual will also become user of a Unix (Red Hat ) PBX integration server, and a workstation on the VAMC's LAN, working as a member of the Telecom/Networking and Customer Service Teams reporting to IRM.    

Duties for the Telecom Technician will include repair and replacement of analog and digital telephones, PBX programming, moves, adds, and changes, including associated upkeep of all documentation.  This individual performs daily back-ups of all the noted servers, adds new users, changes user configurations for single line (analog) and multi-line (digital) phones, and troubleshoots problems on all of the noted Fujitsu  PBX, and Intellicenter ACD systems, the Fortran  Siteman  server, and both Captaris  Voice Mail and Rightfax servers. 

The Telecom Technician helps maintain the VA campus's physical, cable plant of one carbon-block-protected, Nortel  Main Distribution Frame (MDF) which uses Bix Blocks, and over one hundred (100) Intermediate Distribution Frames (IDFs) using a mix of 66 and 110 blocks, carbon block- protection, etc.  Assigning equipment numbers, extensions, etc., must be done by the Telecom Tech via data entry using the Fortran Corporation  Siteman  EMMI (V 2.0) software (and/or the Fujitsu  PBX's EMM  direct command interface) while physical cross connects at the MDF and IDFs (in one or more buildings) are made manually. The Telecom Technician also moves existing (or pulls and terminates new) work station cabling as required, plus any other duties as assigned.


SPECIFICATIONS OF WORK:

1.	 Service:  Service shall consist of trouble shooting and diagnosis of problems in the PBX, all noted servers and systems, and repairing or replacing parts as required. Service is also, adding new (or moving existing) equipment while updating, patching, cleaning, oiling, adjusting, calibrating, and documenting, the maintenance of all equipment and work spaces in first class operating condition.  If replacement parts for major systems are required, they shall be taken from existing inventory, or ordered using established procedures to send out and receive such refurbished or replacement parts.  Said parts must be listed in an up to date inventory spreadsheet, maintained by the Telecom Tech, and able to be accurately reported on, at a moments notice.  Service also includes cleaning and minor-repair of analog phones, patient phones, and digital phones not requiring new or replacement parts.  In cases where individual telephones need repair or replacement, they must be listed on another up to date inventory spreadsheet maintained by the Telecom Tech.  That database is then used to request that phones be sent out for refurbishing, or new ones ordered as part of the IRM budget and procurement processes.  Reporting on needs and plans, may also be required on a moments notice.

2.	Performance:  All trouble shooting, diagnosis, repairs, replacement, or Moves Adds and Changes (MAC) work will commence within 24 hours after receipt of a verbal or telephone message; a written E-Mail (via MS Outlook and/or VISTA's Mailman programs) message; or electronic-work-order notification from this VAMC's Remedy Help Desk system; and will proceed progressively to accomplishment without undue delay.  All work shall be performed by competent Telecom technical-maintenance personnel, who are certified as qualified, to work on the noted specific equipment.  All work shall be performed in a workmanship like manner, in accordance with good professional and commercial practices.

3.   Notification of work to be done:   The Veterans Health Administration, VISN9, Medical Center, Mountain Home, TN; uses an on-line helpdesk software package called Remedy.  Most notification of work to be done is recorded on numbered "Help Desk Tickets" generated by input into that system by members of the Customer Service Team in IRM.  Any verbal requests, via telephone or E-mail messages, must be translated from the messages and entered (by the Telecom Tech) into that same Remedy Help Desk System.  If this is not done by the Telecom Tech, then no credit for work is given or received.  When those work requests are input, they are assigned to the Telecom/Networking Team for repairs, MACs,  or trouble shooting help, etc., for workstations and/or ACD groups; for unified messaging tasks (like Right FAX and CallXpress  Voice Mail additions or changes); plus other jobs like Directory maintenance.  Work orders are completely managed by the Telecom/Networking Team to which the Telephone Tech is assigned.  All tickets are reviewed weekly, and routinely reported monthly.  Ad hoc reporting may be required at any time.  Data entry, by the individual completing the work requested, is required to complete each ticket.

4.   Parts for Major Systems:   Only new (or refurbished) standard parts, furnished by the Manufacturer, a Distributor of, or a Licensed Systems Integrator of the major telecomm equipment (or systems) which are used to meet (or exceed) the repair specifications of that equipment (or systems); may be used by the personnel from the Contracting Company which holds the Equipment Maintenance Contract for that major equipment, or other individuals, to repair that equipment or systems.  All parts shall be manufactured and configured to have full versatility and compatibility with this VAMC's presently installed equipment, firm-wear and software.

4  a. This Veterans Health Administration, VISN9 facility, has a separate, Major Equipment and Systems maintenance contract.  That Contract is used for furnishing parts, upgrades, and major maintenance functions for the PBX, and associated servers.  Depending on the part(s), installation may or may not be included.  Currently, the Contract Telecom Tech (or other member of the Telecom/Networking Team) installs replacement parts, boards, etc., when possible.  This work is routinely performed without additional costs to the VA.  Programming costs for upgrades to the PBX or the associated servers, are separately priced, and are performed by that Equipment Maintenance Company's field engineering personnel, at costs under that separate contract, on a case by case basis.  The Telecom Tech noted here, may have to interact with technical staff from other organizations and provide access to the systems involved.

4  b. That same, separate, Major Equipment and Systems-maintenance-contract, also provides for Off Site Technical Support to this VAMC's IRM-Telecom/Networking Team members.  When problems arise with the major equipment and systems covered under that contract, as a member of the Telecom/Networking Team, the Telecom Tech will initiate contact with the providers of the services under that contract.  That Contract may be, but usually is not, with the Contractor which supplies the individual who acts as the Telecom Tech in this position.  Because of this fact, the Telecom Tech must have excellent communications skills and be able to interact with persons in other stake holder organizations.

5.       Documentation:  The Telecom Tech must be intimately familiar with all of the types of documentation associated with this position.  A great deal of documentation is involved with all aspects of the duties of this person, and the individual who performs these duties must be skilled in their uses and requirements. 

 5  a.      Systems Documentation:  This Veterans Health Administration, VISN9 facility, has and maintains a complete (up to date) set of documentation for the Fujitsu  9600XL  PBX and Intellicenter  ACD server, the Fortran Corporation's  Siteman  EMMI server, and both of the Captaris  CallXpress and RightFAX  servers, on site.  In addition this VAMC's staff has (and uses) documentation sets for various other software packages (like Veritas - Backup Manager, MS Office, etc.) which reside on, or are used on, servers or workstations used by the Telephone Team to which the Telephone Tech is assigned.

5  b.       Process Documentation:  Management at this Veterans Health Administration, VISN9 facility, requires the generation of reports which document the Telecom Team's workload as well as time and effort contributing to the Customer Service Team.  	That same management, requires that we generate data in formats that are extensively used by others at this VAMC.  Those are listed as follows: 

     	VA's Intranet Phonebook:   This documentation is exclusive to the VA Medical Center at Mountain Home, TN.  It arises immediately and concurrently, with the input of new (or changed) data into the Fortan  Siteman EMMI-Server/Monitor System (V 2.0) console.  This web based telephone directory is maintained exclusively, and on a daily basis, by the Telecom Tech and/or other members of the Telecom Team.

	Fujitsu 9600 XL PBX's Call Accounting:  This documentation is recovered as a set of reports taken from the real-time database of the PBX's internal call accounting database.  These reports are also derived from use of that same Fortran  Siteman  EMMI Server/Monitor software.   Additionally, ad hoc reports may be required from use of locally developed "database-sniffer-program" which enables export of certain specific analysis of the PBX's call accounting data.

	ACD System, RightFAX System, and CallXpress System Reporting:  Reports from these systems and their servers are routinely generated by the Telecom Tech, by exporting data from reporting software on those servers.  Such reports may be on paper or included in MS Outlook E-mail messages.   These may be routine or ad hoc reports about any activity on any (or all) of the servers.

	Documentation of the work done:  This documentation is the direct result of the Telecom Tech using this VAMC's  electronic-work-order ticket information, generated in the local, "Remedy Helpdesk-Software" system.

	Documentation of Security Updates:  This documentation is the direct result of the Telecom Tech reporting to IRM and VAMC Management about security patches installed to update servers and workstations used by the Telecom Tech.  

	Documentation of workload, projects completed, hours, etc., required for Payroll:  This documentation is solely the responsibility of the Telecom Tech and is required by the company he/she works for to document the time on the job for accounting and payroll purposes. 
 
Station and building drawings:  Maintenance of complete, up to date, documentation of locations for all MDF to IDF feeds, and IDF to IDF risers, using copper (or Fiber Optic) cables for telephone support on station is essential.  As a member of the Telecom/Networking and Customer Service Teams, the Telecom Technician's duties are critical, and are required to help keep all such drawings up to date at all times.  The Telecom Technician must also have intimate knowledge of routes and destinations for the entire cable plant on this entire 254 acre campus.  The Telecom Technician is also responsible for recording, and communicating, any changes to the entire cable plant which may made by him/her, or that may come to his/her attention.  Communications may be by MS Outlook, telephone conversations, and/or written reports.

Critical nature of Station Documentation:  The VA Medical Center at Mountain Home, TN sits on a 103 year old Historic Campus with over 50 historic buildings.  All inter-building feed cables must travel in conduit either below ground, or within this VAMC's tunnel systems, because no aerial cabling is allowed.  Up to date documentation of all feed cable routes, manholes, hand holes, and entrance facilities are critical.  The Telecom Team maintains MS Excel spreadsheets and furnishes data used by IRM for intra-service Visio drawings, and this VAMC's Engineering Design group who provide inter-service documentation of all station cable plants.  The Telecom Tech (as a member of the Telecom/Networking Team, may also be required to interface with the inter-Agency teams from East Tennessee State University's Quillen College of Medicine which shares the campus.  

At a moments notice, the Telecom Technician may be required by Management, or individuals in other support entities, to respond to trouble calls and advice on where those routes are.  Other support entities may be from this VAMC's Engineering Design or Facilities Management Shops, like Grounds Keeping, Electrical Shops, etc., or service personnel who work for Energy Systems Group (ESG), which is a private Contracting Corporation which supplies all Steam, Electricity, Heat and Air systems to this facility campus wide. 

6.   Data Entry:  Data entry is required of the Telecom Technician to facilitate all facets of PBX and server operations, real-time data collection and reporting.  Much time is spent on data entry and work load accounting.  It is also required to meet the security needs of this VAMC as well as VISN9 objectives, on server administration, updates, security patches, etc.  Besides Telephone trouble shooting skills, much of the Telephone Tech's time is spent performing hands-on data entry work and using critical communications skills to ensure timely, and accurate information in all systems, at all times.

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">The Voluntary Private Sector Preparedness Accreditation and Certification Program (PS-Prep<sup>TM</sup>is mandated by Title IX of the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. Congress directed DHS to designate one or more standards for assessing private sector preparedness. The standards will be used by accredited certification bodies to assess private sector preparedness and planning in the areas of organizational resilience, disaster management, emergency management and business continuity programs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of PS-Prep<sup>TM</sup>is to enhance nationwide resilience in the all-hazards environment by fostering a culture of greater private sector preparedness. PS-Prep<sup>TM</sup>provides a mechanism for a private sector entity-a company, facility, not-for-profit corporation, hospital, stadium, university, etc.-to take the preparedness action required by one of the DHS selected standards. The two methods of participation currently envisioned for PS-Prep<sup>TM</sup> are: (1) self-declaration of conformity, and (2) third party certification.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The option of making a self-declaration will be available to small business participants, defined pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 632, and other non-governmental entities with fewer than 500 employees that do not meet the requirements of 13 CFR part 121 and 15 U.S.C. 632.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All other private sector entities will be eligible for third party certification. Entities that are in compliance with one of these methods will be recognized by DHS under PS-Prep<sup>TM</sup>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>PS-Prep<sup>TM</sup>recognition is still under consideration and more information will be provided in subsequent announcements or notices. Title IX requires that DHS consider the needs of small business, specifically to encourage small business participation in PS-Prep<sup>TM</sup>, by creating separate classifications and methods of certification for small businesses.</span></p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.501(a) with Johnsons Controls, Inc. (JCI) of Milwaukee, Wisconsin a within scope modification to an existing Order (SB134110SE0754) for the repair of a 3,500 ton York refrigeration units (RU) at NIST's Gaithersburg, Maryland campus, identified as RU#1. <br /><br />The RU is a highly specialized chiller with refrigerant fluid under high pressure and complex electronic controls and sensors. The repair involves a major overhaul of the compressor internal components that includes complete disassembly of rotors and seals, replacement of seals, anti-rotation disks and internal components, reassembly of the compressor and restoration to full equipment operations. The compressor motor has been disassembled by JCI for complete trouble-shooting and identification of required repair parts and a detailed diagnostic report has been prepared for the internal component damages that were discovered. The required refurbishment work is required to be performed by a certified JCI technical trained mechanic, and all parts necessary for these service repairs are required to be provided by the equipment manufacturer. Failure to adhere to the manufacturer's requirements will void all future warranty provisions, incur significant financial liability (and safety risk) for the Government and potentially impact the mission of the agency as a result of unauthorized repairs. As a result the only source to perform the required repairs on this compressor are JCI certified technicians and those technicians are employed by JCI.<br /><br />The proposed contract modification is for parts and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, proposals received within fifteen (15) days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement for this repair.<br />

<DESC>THE 2007 NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE APPICABLE TO THIS PROCUREMENT:  221 UTILITIES
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Mid-Atlantic (NAVFAC-MA) intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2913 which allows the Navy to enter into agreements with gas or electric utilities to design and implement cost-effective demand and conservation incentive programs (including energy management services, facilities alterations, installation and maintenance of energy savings devices and technologies by the utilities) in order to address the requirements and circumstances of the installation.
  This contract is referred to as a Utility Energy Savings Contract (UESC).  For purposes of qualifying under this notice, an entity must meet the definition of a Utility before an agreement can be initiated.

The proposed procurement is for identification of various Energy Conservation Measures in specified areas via a no-cost preliminary energy audit.  This project provides for energy efficiency upgrades at Joint Expeditionary Base, Little Creek and Fort Story, Virginia.  The primary goal of the project is to reduce energy consumption and provide more sustainable building infrastructure at JEB Little Creek and JEB Fort Story.

The preliminary audit will require on-site building investigation and evaluation to determine if any significant energy conservation opportunities exist and whether further detail energy analysis is warranted.
  The Government may elect to proceed with further phases under the UESC which includes but are not limited to the feasibility study; the engineering and design phase; the implementation phase.  The process requires that the responsible Utility must have the ability to provide or obtain financing on terms at least as good as those available to customers in the comparable service class, or with a comparable risk profile.  Therefore, contractors will not receive compression until completion of the implementation project, and payments will be based on a long terms (10 years) amortization schedule.  

Interested companies may identify their interest and ability to meet the requirements stated herein and may submit their corporate capabilities for consideration.
  The submission must include the NACIS code and Cage Code.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  Responses to this posting must be submitted to: andrew.smallwood@navy.mil in PDF format no later than May 2, 2011.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. <br /></span>THIS OPPORTUNITY IS <span style="text-decoration: underline;">AVAILABLE ONLY</span> TO CONTRACTORS UNDER THE "National Watershed Protection Program Using Point and Nonpoint Source Water Pollution Controls and Total Maximum Daily Loads" multiple award contracts (EP-C-08-001; EP-C-08-002; EP-C-08-003; and EP-C-08-004)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;The purpose of this task order is to support the EPA Water Quality Management program in overseeing the implementation of ARRA by conducting an analysis of the ARRA-funded 604(b) planning projects. The anticipated period of performance for this task order is anticipated to be from April 25, 2011 through December 31, 2011.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of this analysis is to categorize the types of projects funded, highlight successful or innovative projects, and quantify the environmental benefits achieved by these projects. The contractor will then summarize these findings in a report to communicate the program goals and achievements to the public. The report should assist EPA in evaluating the impact of ARRA on water quality management planning efforts and identify opportunities to support innovative planning activities that will maximize both environmental and economic benefits post-ARRA. The contractor will also assist EPA in developing and implementing an EPA-sponsored national meeting to discuss the results of the analysis, solicit input from State and local partners, and identify lessons learned in the oversight and management of ARRA activities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<p>&emsp;<br />GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>Document Type: Notice of Intent - Sole Source Justification</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is to lease hotel conference space, reception space and food &amp; beverage for reception needed to host the Chief of Staff Team Excellence Awards (CSTEA) program in National Harbor, MD 14-20 September 2011. This conference is required to facilitate the presentation of the Chief of Staff Team Excellence Award (CSTEA) award program and the reception. The requirements of this conference are for a large block of guest rooms (936ea) for 10 days, as well as a large ballroom for 24 hours a day for six consecutive days and two on site meeting rooms for 24 hours a day for three consecutive days. The AFA has chosen the Gaylord National Hotel as the official location for their event. The Gaylord National Hotel is the only hotel capable of meeting the requirements of the AFMA-hosted Chief of Staff Team Excellence Awards (CSTEA) conference. As a result of AFA bookings at the Gaylord National Hotel every year until 2018, and due to the limited capacity of hotels in the general vicinity of the Gaylord National Hotel to meet the requirements of AFMA's CSTEA, it is determined that no source other than the Gaylord National Hotel can meet this requirement. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. In accordance with FAR 6.301(d) the Government will consider any proposal received by the due date for this combined synopsis/solicitation. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract is solely within the discretion of the Government. The request is for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.</p>

Fedbid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government. Attempts to file protests through Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). It is preferable that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest directly with the Contracting Officer responsible for this acquisition should review the procedures at FAR Part 33 and send your protest to Carolyn Wardell, Contracting Officer, at email: http://Carolyn.wardell@us.army.mil. Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest must abide by the provisions in FAR Part 33, Protests, Disputes, and Appeals. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10.

Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the Contracting Officer; this is not an appellate review of a Contracting Officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the Contracting Officer).

<p>(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1, or for the agency, by the Contracting Officer, and approved at a level above the Contracting Officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the Contracting Officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate.</p>

<DESC><p>The Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) regulates the manufacture and distribution of food additives and drugs that will be given to animals. This includes animals from which human foods are derived, as well as food additives and drugs for pet (or companion) animals. CVM is responsible for regulating drugs, devices, and food additives given to, or used on, over one hundred million companion animals, plus millions of poultry, cattle, swine, and minor animal species. (Minor animal species include animals other than cattle, swine, chickens, turkeys, horses, dogs, and cats.)</p>
<p>Within CVM, the Office of Minor Use and Minor Species Animal Drug Development was established in response to the Minor Use and Minor Species (MUMS) Animal Health Act of 2004. The Office is responsible for granting MUMS designations (i.e. seven years of marketing exclusivity and eligibility for grants) for new animal drugs; it adds drugs to an index of legally marketed unapproved new animal drugs for minor species; and approves grant money to assist in defraying the costs of safety and effectiveness testing expenses in the development of designated new animal drugs.</p>
<p>The contractor for this work must have expert knowledge of the Minor Use and Minor Species (MUMS) Animal Health Act of 2004 and the nuances related to the FDA.</p>

NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award. If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NIST's requirements.</p>
<p>The primary specifications stated in the specifications document are minimum specifications. A quoted system must meet or exceed all of those to be considered for award.</p>
<p>As noted in the specifications, stronger consideration will be given to a system that meets one or more of the following secondary specifications:</p>
<p>4) Stronger consideration will be given for a tool capable of supporting 4 solvents;<br /><br />5) Stronger consideration will be given for a tool capable of batch wafer processing;<br /><br />6) Stronger consideration will be given for a tool capable of processing wafer pieces down to 1" square.</p>
<p>A quoted system that fails to meet the secondary specifications will not be deemed technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>
<p>Price: The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness.</p>
<p>Past Performance and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.</p>

This is a combined synopsis / solicitation for commercial items, prepared in accordance with the format of FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. <br /><br />The reference solicitation number is: NHLBI-CSB-(HL)-2011-084-DDC.
<p>This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).</p>
<p>This acquisition is being conducted under the procedures in accordance with FAR 13.3 Simplified Acquisition Methods, and FAR Part 13.5</p>
<p>The resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-049. The total contracted dollar amount, including options will not exceed $6.5 million.</p>
<p>The acquisition is being conducted as a full open competition with set aside for a small business only. The North American Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 334516 and the associated small business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The Government=s anticipated delivery date is one year after receipt of purchase order.</p>
<p>The Government=s acceptance terms and FOB point are the National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Bethesda, Maryland.</p>
<p>Background Information<br />The Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Branch of the Division of Intramural Research, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), is one of the premier cardiovascular programs in the country that develops new methods for the study of cardiovascular disease and the application of image-guided therapies. The Cardiovascular Interventional Program has conducted work that includes wholly real-time MRI guided vascular interventional procedures in humans, as well as preclinical development of novel interventional procedures for the treatment of congenital heart disease.</p>
<p><br />The procurement of a new Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Cardiovascular Interventional Coil shall improve the performance of rapid imaging for interventional applications and enable new procedures to be developed. A coil is sought which contains multiple surface coil elements optimized for accelerated imaging, and fenestrations, which will allow direct access to the thorax.</p>
<p>Purpose<br />The purpose of the proposed acquisition is to identify qualified organizations that can manufacture a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) coil, which has fenestrations (windows) to allow the passage of interventional devices. The coil will be used for preclinical and clinical MRI guided cardiovascular interventions at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), conducted on a clinical Siemens 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner. The coil must conform to the specific technical requirements listed below.</p>
<p>Objectives<br />The NHLBI requires that the MRI Cardiovascular Interventional Coil be of clinical grade to support sterile patient procedures, and to interface to MRI scanners currently installed, as well as the next generation. Detailed requirements are listed below.<br />Services to be performed<br />The Contractor shall deliver an MRI Cardiovascular Interventional Coil to NHLBI, along with supporting files that enable the coil to be recognized by and function with the MRI scanner. The coil should connect to the existing MRI system, as well as the next generation system. A delivery timeline and warranty period should be specified.</p>
<p>Technical Requirements:<br />(1) The coil must connect to a Siemens 1.5 Tesla scanner. The NHLBI currently has an Espree, which will be upgraded to an Aera. The coil must be able to connect to both models.<br />(2) The coil should cover the anterior and posterior surfaces of the thorax.<br />(3) The anterior portion of the coil should accommodate different body shapes. This may be accomplished either by the use of a flexible form factor or by multiple segments.<br />(4) The coil should cover a nominal imaging field of view of a minimum of 30cm (Right - Left) x 30cm (Head - Foot).<br />(5) The coil should contain a minimum of two fenestrations on each (Right, Left) side of the anterior portion of the coil, to allow access to the intercostal spaces.<br />(6) It is desirable for the coil to contain fenestrations along the midline of the chest, to allow access to the sub-xiphoid space.<br />(7) The fenestrations in the coil should be a minimum of 3cm long in the smallest dimension.<br />(8) The fenestrations should be able to made sterile, so that sterile devices that pass through remain sterile. <br />(9) The coil should contain a minimum of 8 elements in each (anterior and posterior) portion, to enable parallel imaging. More than 8 elements are desirable.</p>
<p><br />Evaluation Criteria<br />The proposals will be evaluated based on the following evaluation criteria;</p>
<p>Technical Evaluation Criteria (total 100 points)<br />The proposals shall be evaluated by NIH with regards to the design and anticipated performance of the coil. Weight shall be given to the timeliness of delivery, technical performance, and overall design<br />1) Schedule (20 pts)<br />a. The final version of the coil must be delivered within one year after the contract is awarded. Prototypes may be delivered for testing and technical feedback at intermediate times. <br />2) Performance (35 pts)<br />a. The coil must perform equivalently or better than the current Siemens cardiac array (also called body array), in terms of signal-to-noise during non-accelerated imaging. NHLBI is willing to work with the vendor to perform these tests at the NIH.<br />b. The coil must perform equivalently or better than the current Siemens cardiac array (also called body array), in terms of signal-to-noise and "G-factor" when performing accelerated imaging. NHLBI is willing to work with the vendor to perform these tests at the NIH.<br />3) Design (45 pts)<br />a. The coil must connect to a Siemens 1.5 Tesla scanner. The NHLBI currently has an Espree, which will be upgraded to an Aera. The coil must be able to connect to both models. <br />i. A coil file must be supplied by the vendor, which will enable the coil to be recognized by the Siemens scanner.<br />ii. The coil code must not conflict with any currently used product or custom coils used. This code should be chosen together by the NIH and the vendor.<br />c. The coil should cover the anterior surface of the thorax. For the posterior portion, one of two options are acceptable:<br />i. A second coil to cover the posterior portion (preferable).<br />ii. Use of the Siemens spine coil to cover the posterior portion. However, the performance of parallel imaging must still be acceptable.<br />d. The anterior portion of the coil should accommodate different body shapes. This may be accomplished either by the use of a flexible form factor or by multiple segments.<br />e. The coil should cover a nominal imaging field of view of a minimum of 30cm (Right - Left) x 30cm (Head - Foot).<br />f. The coil should contain a minimum of two fenestrations on each (Right, Left) side of the anterior portion of the coil, to allow access to the intercostal spaces.<br />g. It is desirable for the coil to contain fenestrations along the midline of the chest, to allow access to the sub-xiphoid space.<br />h. The fenestrations in the coil should be a minimum of 3cm long in the smallest dimension.<br />i. The fenestrations should be able to be made sterile, so that sterile devices that pass through remain sterile. <br />j. The coil should contain a minimum of 8 elements in the anterior portion of the coil. If a posterior portion is delivered, a minimum of 8 elements should be included in the posterior portion as well. More than 8 elements are desirable.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format of FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued for the solicitation number NICHD-11-058-1. The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC2005-50 dated April 15, 2011. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures and issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 333314, which has a size standard of 500 employees. This is not set aside for Small Businesses. The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health (NIH), requires a ConfoCor 3 APD module kit with ZEN 2008 and filter Set Advanced 561nm f/ConfoCor3. The system shall include the following: Basic filter set VIS Confocor 3 (561 nm); C-Apo 40X Objective; Coupling port; Excitation Line Selection Filter; Confocor 3 software ZEN 2008; Enhanced software package FCS and Operating Manual.
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD</p>
<p>A. GENERAL<br />The major evaluation factors for this solicitation include two parts which shall hold equal merit in determining best overall value to the Government. The two parts are as follows:</p>
<p>1) Technical Evaluation - which encompasses experience and past performance of demonstrating the ability to meet the specifications factors listed (see Section B below);</p>
<p>2) Cost/Price Evaluation proposal will be evaluated for realism and reasonableness.</p>
<p><br />B. TECHNICAL EVALUATION <br />Offerors proposals shall be evaluated on the criterion listed below and shall receive an overall rating of, Exceptional Acceptability; Acceptable or Unacceptable. Only proposals that are determined to be Acceptable shall be eligible and considered for award. The definition that will be used in evaluating and rating the criterion is as follows:<br />&bull; Exceptional Acceptability: Equipment exceeds the specified performance or capabilities in a beneficial way has no major weaknesses or deficiencies.</p>
<p>&bull; Acceptable: Equipment meets specification standards and any weaknesses or deficiencies are considered minor and are readily correctable or acceptable in meeting the overall requirement.</p>
<p>&bull; Unacceptable: Equipment fails to meet the specification(s) and the weaknesses and/or deficiencies are considered uncorrectable without major revisions and would potentially subject the Government to overall risks in performance - either in time and/or money.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL FACTORS:</p>
<p>CONFOCOR 3 Module for Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy. 2 Channel system for Cross-correlation.</p>
<p>System Requirements: LSM 710 with motorized Axio Observer Sideport. The system comes with a C-Apo 40X, ConfoCor 3 APD module Kit with ZEN 2008.</p>
<p>System includes: Basic Filter Set VIS Confocor 3 (561nm); C-Apo 40X Objective; Coupling port; Excitation Line Selection Filter; Confocor 3 Software ZEN 2010; Enhanced software package FCS; Operating manual; and Filter Set Advanced 561 nm f/ConfoCor3</p>
<p>The ConfoCor 3 is directly attached to the channel output of the LSM 710. This attachment provides flexibility for the combination provides 36 channels: 2x PMT; 1x Spectral detector with 32 channels; 2x APD.</p>
<p>The basic software controls the detection module and allows convenient analysis of single measurements or software-controlled multi-measurements. Auto- and cross-correlation are calculated in real time, i.e. at the same time as the current measurement.</p>
<p><br />C. COST/PRICE EVALUATION:</p>
<p>Offeror proposed price shall be evaluated on realism and reasonable for the Government to purchase the equipment.</p>
<p>For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the government that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to prices in the market. Normally, price reasonableness is established through adequate price competition, but may also be determined through cost and price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404.<br />Realism will be evaluated only on the offeror(s) inputs which the Government will use to determine the most probable cost/price for the equipment in a manner consistent with the offeror's proposal. Cost/Price realism analysis will be conducted in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(d). The result of the cost/price realism analysis will be considered in the making the best value tradeoff decision.</p>
<p>D. TRADEOFF-DECISION (SELECTION FOR AWARD):</p>
<p>Contract award shall be made to the responsible Offeror whose technical and price proposals, in conforming to this solicitation, provides an overall best value to the Government. The Government's objective is to obtain the highest technically accepted proposal at the most fair and reasonable proposed price. In selecting an offeror for award, offerors are instructed and advised that lowest price technically acceptable shall not automatically determine best overall value. Below is a table for information purposes to demonstrate the overall tradeoff process and an example that the Government may select higher technical acceptable proposal at a higher proposed price due to the overall value.</p>
<p>TRADE-OFF TABLE<br />Overall Technical Rating Proposed Price<br />Vendor A Unacceptable $80<br />Vendor B Acceptable $210<br />Vendor C Exceptionally Acceptable $225<br />Vendor D Acceptable $220</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />In the example above, the Government could select Vendor C for award because overall best value is justified and supported that $225 is considered a fair and reasonable price for the purchase of the equipment. To select an Exceptional Offeror for $15 greater than the lowest-priced/technical acceptable is considered obtaining the highest quality of equipment for the proposed price. (Overall Exceptionally Acceptable would be a result of receiving 6 or more Exceptionally Acceptable ratings per criteria listed above).</p>
<p>The offeror must include a completed copy of the provision of FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with its offer. The provisions of FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items; FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items; FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; and FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items - Deviation for Simplified Acquisitions applies to this acquisition. The offeror must include their Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size.

<p>12. CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)<br />(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.</p>
<p>(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.</p>
<p>(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).</p>
<p>(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.</p>
<p>(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.</p>
<p>(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.</p>
<p>(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>1.0 ORGANIZATION<br /><br />1.1 Organization The Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC), of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS or NOAA-Fisheries), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Department of Commerce (DOC) is a government agency charged with the mission of stewardship of living marine resources.</p>
<p>1.2 Background and Objectives The NWFSC provides scientific and technical support to NMFS for the management, conservation, and wise-use of the Northwest region's marine and anadromous resources. To address some of these needs the Conservation Biology Division formed the Mathematical Biology and Systems Monitoring Program to develop, in tandem with the existing Salmon Science Programs and Salmon Recovery Planning Teams, quantitative tools for assessing population and habitat status and recovery potential and progress. One of the major projects undertaken by this program is the development of a large-scale comprehensive monitoring program to be implemented in three Columbia River sub-basins. The primary objective of this project is the development of a rule set to guide the implementation of large-scale monitoring and evaluation programs across the Columbia River basin. The project will accomplish this goal through the quantitative assessment of status and effectiveness monitoring and evaluation approaches. The component of the overall project described herein specifically addresses the issue of developing quantitative methods of terrain classification in large Columbia River basin watersheds.<br />Identifying watersheds with similar physical and biological characteristics supports the potential to extrapolate watershed-scale mechanistic studies of salmonid population processes to larger areas not directly included in the initial work. To generate landscape classification schemes for this purpose requires choosing biophysical variables that capture most of the information pertinent to salmonid productivity. The choice of these variables is therefore critical to the success of this exercise. Variables are to be chosen based on the current understanding of fish-habitat relationships available in the literature. The two main assumptions underlying this exercise are that variables used are: 1) some of the most important determinants of the overall characteristic of a watershed, and 2) important determinants of salmonid population processes.<br />The basic list of variables currently thought to correlate to fish productivity includes climate, geology, watershed topology, vegetation, channel confinement and gradient, landuse/cover, ownership, wetlands. In addition, recent work shows that channel size (e.g., drainage area or some regionally calibrated estimate of discharge) and elevation are also important. A variety of studies have shown empirical correlations between fish numbers and these variables. It is certainly feasible to simply seek correlations between the distribution (histograms, cumulative distributions) of these attributes and fish species and population sizes, which would allow extrapolation to other basins that lack monitoring data. However, it may also be useful to look at how these attributes affect fish directly, which may provide a more powerful means of extrapolation.<br />Ultimately each attribute included in the extrapolation process somehow affects aquatic habitat and these effects occur point by point through the channel network. Thus, it is the combined suite of variables at each point that is important. The relationship of channel gradient and valley width for a reach is lost when the distribution for each variable is viewed independently. A measure of basin productivity requires a method of assessing the effects and interaction of all variables point by point and then aggregating that information over the basin. A number of recent examples of constructing similar geomorphic based watershed intrinsic potential metrics have been very useful for the management and recovery planning of listed anadromous salmonids.<br />It is feasible to build datasets from which such combinations of attributes can be determined for the upstream catchments, reach-by-reach through a channel network. For example, a database that includes measures of channel size, gradient, and confinement for each reach can be queried to provide the total area of potential coho-rearing habitat for the upstream catchments to each reach. If the dataset includes the mean elevation, area, and length of roads for the area draining to each reach (excluding upstream drainage area), bull trout habitat patches can be delineated. The dataset contains reach-level data from which integrated measures can be assembled over any basin scale. By maintaining information at the reach scale, it is possible to examine many combinations of attributes, so that a uniform dataset structure can be used to assess habitat over a diverse range of landscapes. For example, input data can be defined at very fine scales, e.g., the DEM-pixel (10m), and then aggregated up into reach and catchment-scale measures.<br />The primary objective of this project is to generate a number of base data layers that describe watershed terrain in such a manner as to be incorporated directly into terrain classification schemes based on the biophysical determinants of salmonid population processes. Additionally, existing data must be used to verify the landscape classification, thereby identifying potential weaknesses, limitations and process refinement requirements. Specifically, this project will address the following tasks:<br />1.2.1 Implement developed numerical algorithms (computer models compatible with existing data formats and GIS software) that use available data to estimate pertinent geomorphic attributes.<br />1.2.2 Evaluate, verify, and interpret results to identify iterative alterations of the conceptual models and subsequent numerical implementation based on the evaluation, verification, and interpretation.</p>
<p>2.0 SERVICES REQUIRED<br />Implement numerical models based on existing Digital Elevation Model data to differentiate watersheds based on physical properties. The physical features used to differentiate watersheds from one another will be hill slope and channel properties - characteristics relevant to questions of land use impacts, restoration, channel, and biological response. These features will be generated as part of a terrain mapping and analysis system utilizing Earth System Institute's river network model, NetMap. These features included such things as: cumulative distribution (CDF) of hill slope gradients (i.e., characterizing erosion potential); CDF of channel gradients (characterizes channel and habitat types and responses); grain sizes; basin shape, density of confluences, and location of geomorphically significant confluences (indexes of the non uniform distribution of riverine habitats). The work needed to accomplish this consists of two specific tasks.</p>

52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.
 The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

(I) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT 
(II) PAST PERFORMANCE 
(III) PRICE 

The Government intends to make award on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for Factor (i) and Factor (ii), the two non-price factors. (The Government will not, however, provide additional credit for those proposals that may exceed the standards.)

Offerors proposals will be evaluated under Factor (i) above, which represents minimum acceptable criteria. Under this factor, the Government will rate the products offered as either technically acceptable or unacceptable.
 Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the entire proposal technically unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award. 

Only those Offers which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii). Under this factor, the Government will rate past performance as either acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to receive a rating of acceptable for this factor will render the entire proposal unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award. 

For those proposals that are rated acceptable on Factor (i) and Factor (ii), the Government will then evaluate Factor (iii), Price. 

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.
 Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offerors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint. 

(b) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT, Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating either commercial product brochures, drawings or technical information submitted in response to FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS, Subparagraph (b)(4) which is incorporated by reference in this solicitation. Offerors technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation. Items offered, as provided in Offerors technical information, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technically unacceptable.
 Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award. 

(c) Offerors PAST PERFORMANCE information submitted as required by FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS , Subparagraph (b)(10), will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has an acceptable record of past performance. A proposal that receives a rating of acceptable on past performance is one that demonstrates little anticipated risk in the areas of quality of the product, timely delivery, and customer satisfaction. Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate acceptable past performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years.
 

The evaluation may take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies and subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement. 

Offers that lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor. Any Offerors proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government. Thus, the Contracting Officer may determine it is an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.

PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation. Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources that may have relevant information.
 

(d) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/ . 

Delivery shall be no later than 90 days after receipt of order.

All quotes shall include price(s), FOB point, a point of contact, name and phone number, GSA contract number if applicable, business size, and payment terms.
 Quotes will be accepted via email at lenette.santana@navy.mil. Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all specifications and requirements. 

This announcement will close at 12:00 PM PST on 10 May 2011. Contact Lenette Santana who can be reached at 805-982-2193 or email lenette.santana@navy.mil. All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency.

This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity
in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design
capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified
source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The
approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical
data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or
knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate
source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's
procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity.
 The
qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering
activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.
The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award,
as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not
been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition.  Only the source(s) previously approved by the government for this item have
been solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally
such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you
are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the
information detailed in the "https://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx"
Naval Inventory Control Point Philadelphia Source Approval Information
Brochure.
  This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted
based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item,
or if this is an item you have never made.  If your request for source
approval is currently being evaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with your offer a
copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval.
Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval
Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source
Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.

The Government will not reimburse interested parties for any cost associated with responding to this business opportunity. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. The anticipated contract award date is on or before February 23, 2011.<br />BASIS FOR AWARD: The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible quoter whose quotation is responsive to this solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government, using the tradeoff approach. Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each quoter's quotation against the evaluation criteria described below. In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the evaluated price. The Government is more concerned with obtaining a superior Technical Capability quotation than making an award at the lowest evaluated price. However, the Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superiority of one technical quotation over another. Thus, to the extent that quoter's technical and past performance quotations are evaluated as close or similar in merit, the evaluated price is more likely to be a determining factor.<br /><br />EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations (these factors are listed in their relative order of importance): Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Price.<br />Factor 1 - Technical Capability: (a) Contract Requirements. Quotations will be evaluated on the quoter's ability to provide all of the contract requirements relating to meeting space, audiovisual equipment and technical support, food and beverage service and menu options, business services, and lodging. Quotations must address the quoter's ability to meet or exceed the requirements of the ADA, as amended by the ADA Amendments Act as it relates to the facility conference space, lodging, and parking. Quotations will be evaluated on the quality of the customer services provided, the layout design and quality of the facilities as reflected by the physical layout and atmosphere of meeting space and the maintenance and upkeep of the facilities including amenities to support the conference such as free wi-fi in the conference space. (b) Availability of Dates. Quoters will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide the required services on the dates requested. Additional consideration will be given to quotations which demonstrate availability of facilities on the preferred dates in order of preference, i.e. 1st choice date, 2nd choice date, and 3rd choice date. (c) Location. Quotations will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide a facility on or near the boardwalk within the zip code 08401 U.S. Postal Code area, with adequate low cost or free parking for participants and presenters. Site Visits: The EEOC reserves the right to conduct a site visit of all quoters who are rated to be technically acceptable. The site visit will review and evaluate the same technical items identified in the Technical Capabilities portion of the technical evaluation factors.<br /><br />Factor 2 - Past Performance: The quoter must provide a minimum of three (3) references for past performance of similar work performed within the past three (3) years. The information for each reference shall include the following: 1. Name and address of government agency or non-government client; 2. Name, title, email and telephone number of Contracting Officer, or other point of contact; 3. Name, title, email and telephone number of client's program or project manager, if applicable; 4. Contract number, period of performance, and total dollar value of contract; and 5. Description of services provided. EEOC will evaluate past performance in terms of customer service on similar requirements, feedback from references on room design/layout and quality/upkeep of the facilities and d&eacute;cor, and the availability of amenities (e.g., high-speed internet, etc) and staff to support the conference. In the event that a quoter has no Past Performance history, this rating factor will be considered neutral and will neither increase nor decrease the overall rating.<br />Factor 3 - Price: The price quotation will be evaluated against the Independent Government Cost Estimate. Each quoter shall complete the Response Form, Attachment A. which includes the quoter's pricing quotation. Evaluations of quotations will consider the following pricing information: pricing provided for all line items listed in this RFQ in the units and format provided; pricing of recommended menu options for breakfast, lunch, snacks and beverages; rates for audio-visual and business services; sleeping room rates; and cost options for facility parking rates. The EEOC is a tax exempt Federal agency; please do not include any sales tax in quotations for which the Federal Government is exempt.<br /><br />Notice: The Government intends to evaluate quotations and make award without discussions (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the quoter's initial quote should contain the quoter's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES.

By submission of its offer in accordance with the instructions provided in clause FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions and representations and certifications, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. This combined synopsis/solicitation will result in a firm-fixed price contract.</p>
<p>a. Price Evaluation. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantity by the contractor's proposed unit price to confirm the extended amount for each contract line item (CLIN). The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price.</p>
<p>b. Past Performance: Using the information supplied per the addendum to 52.212-1, Part II, Past Performance Information, the contracting officer will evaluate each offeror's past performance.</p>
<p>c. Using the procedures in FAR Part 13, the contracting officer will arrive at a best value determination combining an offeror's price and past performance, where past performance is significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>d. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>e. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposal preparation instructions. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>f. The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.</p>

<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Additional clauses/provisions in full text)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

<p><br /><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>Title: Mini Dockside Repairs of CGC ALEX HALEY (WMEC 39)
<p><br />This is a 100% Total Small Business Set-Aside combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-11-R-P45GE1 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-46. This is a 100% small business set-aside procurement. The NAICS is 336611. <br />It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), U.S.Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC. 20593, Telephone (202) 3723692, Fax: (202) 475, 3904.</p>

Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>INSPECTION OF CUTTER PRIOR TO SUBMISSION OF OFFERS<br />(a) All prospective offerors are urged to visit the cutter and visually inspect each item of<br />Work and to become acquainted with local conditions, locations of items and fixtures,<br />removals, replacements, interference and the nature of work.

Such proposals may be rejected as unacceptable without further discussions. In addition, the Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration those proposals so deficient in information as to require a major re-write or revision in order to become acceptable.<br />(d) The technical evaluation factors and other factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award.<br />(e) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal Revisions.

<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-<br />Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority.<br />Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size standard in paragraph (c) of this clause. Such a concern is "not dominant in its field of operation" when it does not exercise a controlling or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged.

<DESC><p>IARPA has not amended the content of the Babel Program Broad Agency Announcement (IARPA-BAA-11-02). Rather, the purpose of this amendment is to invite the private sector to assist IARPA with operationally testing its new web-based electronic proposal submission system. IARPA has recently brought IARPA Distribution and Evaluation System (IDEAS) on-line, and seeks industry assistance with operationally testing and validating the system's performance.</p>
<p>In addition to delivering proposals to the McLean, VA address listed in BAA Section 4.C.2., IARPA encourages offerors to upload their proposal documents to the website at <a href="https://iarpa-ideas.gov">https://iarpa-ideas.gov</a>. However, submitting proposals to IDEAS is not a requirement and is not a substitute for delivering proposals in accordance with BAA Section 4.C.2. Moreover, the Government will not evaluate proposal documents submitted to IDEAS. Rather, submissions to IDEAS will be compared to your formal submission for completeness only, to enable IARPA leadership to make a decision to move to Full Operating Capability for this new web-based system.</p>
<p>As stated in BAA Section 4.A.1., reviewers receive the electronic copy submitted by CD. Hard copies are primarily for archival purposes. In the case of inconsistencies between the hard copy and the CD copy, the CD copy takes precedence.</p>

This is a combined synopsis / solicitation for commercial items, prepared in accordance with the format of FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. <br /><br />The reference solicitation number is: NHLBI-CSB-(HL)-2011-084-DDC.
<p>This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).</p>
<p>This acquisition is being conducted under the procedures in accordance with FAR 13.3 Simplified Acquisition Methods, and FAR Part 13.5</p>
<p>The resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-049. The total contracted dollar amount, including options will not exceed $6.5 million.</p>
<p>The acquisition is being conducted as a full open competition with set aside for a small business only. The North American Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 334516 and the associated small business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The Government=s anticipated delivery date is one year after receipt of purchase order.</p>
<p>The Government=s acceptance terms and FOB point are the National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Bethesda, Maryland.</p>
<p>Background Information<br />The Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Branch of the Division of Intramural Research, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), is one of the premier cardiovascular programs in the country that develops new methods for the study of cardiovascular disease and the application of image-guided therapies. The Cardiovascular Interventional Program has conducted work that includes wholly real-time MRI guided vascular interventional procedures in humans, as well as preclinical development of novel interventional procedures for the treatment of congenital heart disease.</p>
<p><br />The procurement of a new Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Cardiovascular Interventional Coil shall improve the performance of rapid imaging for interventional applications and enable new procedures to be developed. A coil is sought which contains multiple surface coil elements optimized for accelerated imaging, and fenestrations, which will allow direct access to the thorax.</p>
<p>Purpose<br />The purpose of the proposed acquisition is to identify qualified organizations that can manufacture a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) coil, which has fenestrations (windows) to allow the passage of interventional devices. The coil will be used for preclinical and clinical MRI guided cardiovascular interventions at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), conducted on a clinical Siemens 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner. The coil must conform to the specific technical requirements listed below.</p>
<p>Objectives<br />The NHLBI requires that the MRI Cardiovascular Interventional Coil be of clinical grade to support sterile patient procedures, and to interface to MRI scanners currently installed, as well as the next generation. Detailed requirements are listed below.<br />Services to be performed<br />The Contractor shall deliver an MRI Cardiovascular Interventional Coil to NHLBI, along with supporting files that enable the coil to be recognized by and function with the MRI scanner. The coil should connect to the existing MRI system, as well as the next generation system. A delivery timeline and warranty period should be specified.</p>
<p>Technical Requirements:<br />(1) The coil must connect to a Siemens 1.5 Tesla scanner. The NHLBI currently has an Espree, which will be upgraded to an Aera. The coil must be able to connect to both models.<br />(2) The coil should cover the anterior and posterior surfaces of the thorax.<br />(3) The anterior portion of the coil should accommodate different body shapes. This may be accomplished either by the use of a flexible form factor or by multiple segments.<br />(4) The coil should cover a nominal imaging field of view of a minimum of 30cm (Right - Left) x 30cm (Head - Foot).<br />(5) The coil should contain a minimum of two fenestrations on each (Right, Left) side of the anterior portion of the coil, to allow access to the intercostal spaces.<br />(6) It is desirable for the coil to contain fenestrations along the midline of the chest, to allow access to the sub-xiphoid space.<br />(7) The fenestrations in the coil should be a minimum of 3cm long in the smallest dimension.<br />(8) The fenestrations should be able to made sterile, so that sterile devices that pass through remain sterile. <br />(9) The coil should contain a minimum of 8 elements in each (anterior and posterior) portion, to enable parallel imaging. More than 8 elements are desirable.</p>
<p><br />Evaluation Criteria<br />The proposals will be evaluated based on the following evaluation criteria;</p>
<p>Technical Evaluation Criteria (total 100 points)<br />The proposals shall be evaluated by NIH with regards to the design and anticipated performance of the coil. Weight shall be given to the timeliness of delivery, technical performance, and overall design<br />1) Schedule (20 pts)<br />a. The final version of the coil must be delivered within one year after the contract is awarded. Prototypes may be delivered for testing and technical feedback at intermediate times. <br />2) Performance (35 pts)<br />a. The coil must perform equivalently or better than the current Siemens cardiac array (also called body array), in terms of signal-to-noise during non-accelerated imaging. NHLBI is willing to work with the vendor to perform these tests at the NIH.<br />b. The coil must perform equivalently or better than the current Siemens cardiac array (also called body array), in terms of signal-to-noise and "G-factor" when performing accelerated imaging. NHLBI is willing to work with the vendor to perform these tests at the NIH.<br />3) Design (45 pts)<br />a. The coil must connect to a Siemens 1.5 Tesla scanner. The NHLBI currently has an Espree, which will be upgraded to an Aera. The coil must be able to connect to both models. <br />i. A coil file must be supplied by the vendor, which will enable the coil to be recognized by the Siemens scanner.<br />ii. The coil code must not conflict with any currently used product or custom coils used. This code should be chosen together by the NIH and the vendor.<br />c. The coil should cover the anterior surface of the thorax. For the posterior portion, one of two options are acceptable:<br />i. A second coil to cover the posterior portion (preferable).<br />ii. Use of the Siemens spine coil to cover the posterior portion. However, the performance of parallel imaging must still be acceptable.<br />d. The anterior portion of the coil should accommodate different body shapes. This may be accomplished either by the use of a flexible form factor or by multiple segments.<br />e. The coil should cover a nominal imaging field of view of a minimum of 30cm (Right - Left) x 30cm (Head - Foot).<br />f. The coil should contain a minimum of two fenestrations on each (Right, Left) side of the anterior portion of the coil, to allow access to the intercostal spaces.<br />g. It is desirable for the coil to contain fenestrations along the midline of the chest, to allow access to the sub-xiphoid space.<br />h. The fenestrations in the coil should be a minimum of 3cm long in the smallest dimension.<br />i. The fenestrations should be able to be made sterile, so that sterile devices that pass through remain sterile. <br />j. The coil should contain a minimum of 8 elements in the anterior portion of the coil. If a posterior portion is delivered, a minimum of 8 elements should be included in the posterior portion as well. More than 8 elements are desirable.</p>

<DESC>TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE - FIRM FIXED PRICE
<p>Background:</p>
<p>AIDS.gov serves to support the policy and programs of HHS Federal programs and their grantee communities. AIDS.gov serves as an information gateway to drive Web traffic to Federal domestic HIV/AIDS information and resources along with the development of new media tools that improve the response to HIV/AIDS. In addition, we report on and monitor key Federal resources and policies that support the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. AIDS.gov and OHAP need a senior researcher who can provide support for HHS' Strategy implementation efforts.</p>
<p>The following pages include:</p>
<p>&bull; Introduction<br />&bull; Qualifications<br />&bull; Scope of Work-Tasks<br />&bull; Past Performance<br />&bull; Delivery Schedule<br /><br />INTRODUCTION<br />The National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) is the first comprehensive, coordinated national HIV/AIDS plan. The Strategy identifies clear and measurable targets to be achieved by 2015, and requires multiple Federal Departments and agencies to compile detailed annual implementation plans and submit them to the White House and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).</p>
<p>OHAP coordinates a variety of activities within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement the NHAS, and also collaborates with other Federal agencies to support the Strategy. The Secretary and the White House have tasked OHAP with a number of Strategy-related communications tasks which must be completed rapidly.</p>
<p>Many of the Federal implementation activities for the Strategy are predicated on all Americans having access to a common baseline of information about the current HIV epidemic. This includes: knowing how HIV is transmitted and prevented; knowing which behaviors place individuals at greatest risk for infection; and understanding the importance of early diagnosis and access to treatment. Equally important is sharing information about the Strategy and how various sectors of society are contributing to the national effort to achieve its goals. As such, the Department and White House are committed to continued transparency in implementing the Strategy and engaging stakeholders and the public in these efforts.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: The period of performance will include a base year (one year) and two one-year options. The deliverables will be the same for all years.</p>
<p>Base Year: July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2012 $___________________<br />Option I: July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2013 $____________________<br />Option II: July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2014 $____________________</p>
<p>QUALIFICATIONS<br />AIDS.gov and OHAP need a Senior HIV/Public Health Researcher who has:</p>
<p>1. Knowledge and experience of HIV/AIDS in the United States and its disproportionate impact on certain populations<br />2. Significant knowledge of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, including the Strategy, the accompanying Presidential Memorandum, the Federal Implementation Plan, lead agency operational plans, and the NHAS blog series<br />3. In-depth knowledge of the six lead Federal agencies (the Departments of Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, Labor, and the Social Security Administration) and their respective NHAS operational plans<br />4. Understanding of the roles, function, and members of the Department's NHAS Implementation Group and the HIV/AIDS activities of various HHS operational divisions and staff offices<br />5. Understanding of, and experience working with, the Office of HIV/AIDS Policy<br />6. Familiarity with purpose, audiences, and components of AIDS.gov and with HHS Web policies and procedures<br />7. Understanding of the Affordable Care Act and how it affects HIV prevention, care, and treatment<br />8. At least five (5) years of experience working on HIV/AIDS issues at a senior level<br />9. At least five (5) years of experience in public health communications activities across multiple Federal agencies dealing with diverse constituencies (e.g., public health leaders, national networks, local community-based organizations) and using a variety of communications channels, including fact sheets, blog posts, websites, and videos/podcasts.<br />10. Masters degree<br />11. Ability to attend at least 3 meetings per month in Washington, DC</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.</p>
<p>If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>This Is A Request For Information Announcement For Purposes Of Conducting Market Research Only. There Is No Solicitation Available At This Time. Requests For A Solicitation Will Not Receive A Response. <br><br>The U. S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) is conducting market research to identify flame resistant fabric materials that meet or exceed criteria defined in NFPA 1977-2005, Standard on Protective Clothing and Equipment for Wildland Fire Fighting and are suitable for use in a wild land fire fighter uniform. The National Protection Center (NPC), NSRDEC, is conducting this effort on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate. The objective of this program is to develop a new wild land fire fighter uniform system that will improve the current level of flame and heat protection while decreasing the heat stress of the wearer during fire fighting operations. This information will be used to select uniform materials for this application.  The system will consist of an outer garment and next to skin inner layer garments.<br><br>All outer garment materials must meet the requirements of NFPA 1977-2005 and the following levels of protection and comfort, as determined by the following test methods:<br><br>1. Physical Characteristics<br>a. Tearing Strength, per ASTM D 1424 - 5 lb. min. <br>b. Dimensional Stability, AATCC 135 - 5.0 max<br><br>2. Comfort - <br>a. Total Heat Loss (THL), per ASTM F 1868 - THL shall be 500 or greater.<br>b. Air permeability, per ASTM D 737 - No specific performance level is required.<br><br>3. Protection - <br>a.

Data should include the test results, who performed the testing, and when it was performed. Complete testing reports are not required. <br><br>This information will be evaluated by the program office. Based on the technical data provided by each respondent, the program office will determine if materials require additional test and evaluation. The results of this program will be used by California Wild Land Fire Fighters to make decisions regarding the selection of materials for next generation duty uniforms. <br><br>Because this material is not intended for a Department of Defense or a Department of Homeland Security application nor is the procurement of a wild land fire fighter duty uniform subject to FEMA grant funding, this survey is open to all sources of textile material, both foreign and domestic, to include small businesses. The sourcing of material will need to be identified since individual state and local agencies may or may not have procurement rules or regulations pertaining to sourcing of materials or garments. <br><br>Respondents to this request for information shall submit: <br>1. A physical description of the material, including weight per square yard.<br>2. Test data, in accordance with the criteria mentioned above, to characterize the comfort and performance of the material. <br>3. Indicate whether additional material is available for purchase and the lead time required for purchase. <br>4. Identify the sourcing (foreign or domestic) of the material.<br>5. Identify the cost of the material ($ USD/square yard).<br>6. Any information of prior use of this material in another uniform application.<br>7. Any attachments shall be in Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) format.<br><br>The Government will not reimburse any business concern for any information submitted in response to this sources sought request. Submission of information or samples is voluntary. Any proprietary information will be held confidential. Business concerns submitting responses should indicate whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone or service disabled veteran owned small business.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY FOR THE PURPOSES OF CONDUCTING MARKET RESEARCH. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.<br><br><br>This Is A Request For Information Announcement For Purposes Of Conducting Market Research Only.  There Is No Solicitation Available At This Time.  Requests For A Solicitation Will Not Receive A Response.  <br><br>The U. S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) is conducting market research to identify fabric materials with protection capabilities that would be suitable for use in a duty uniform for state and local law enforcement.  The National Protection Center (NPC), NSRDEC, is conducting this effort on behalf of the National Institute of Justice (NIJ).  The objective of this program is to identify textile materials that will improve the current level of protection of law enforcement officers while maintaining the current levels of comfort, appearance, and durability.  Current law enforcement duty uniforms provide minimum levels of protection.  This information will be used by state and local law enforcement to select a uniform material with improved protection capabilities for their specific operational requirements. <br><br>Candidate materials will be classified by weight per Section I below.  Three mandatory categories (comfort, appearance & durability) of material characteristics are defined below in Section II.  All material candidates should meet the required criteria for comfort, appearance and durability, however, material candidates that do not meet the required criteria will be considered if technical data for all criteria is provided.  Desired protection capabilities are defined below in Section III.  A candidate material does not need to provide all of the desired protection capabilities as the specific requirement for material protection capability varies across the spectrum of law enforcement agencies.  Consequently, multiple material candidates, with different types or levels of protection capability, may be submitted.      <br><br>I.	Candidate materials will be assigned to one of two weight classes, based on weight:  <br>1.	Class I: Lightweight - Materials weighing less than 5.75 oz/yd2<br>2.	Class II: Midweight/heavyweight - Materials weighing 5.75 oz/yd2 or more. <br><br>II.	All materials should meet the following levels of comfort, appearance and durability, as determined by the following test methods:<br>1.	Comfort - <br>a.	Air permeability, per ASTM D 737-04.  Class I - 50.0 ft3/min/ft2, Class II - 10.0 ft3/min/ft2<br>2.	Appearance<br>a.	Material appearance, per AATCC 143-2006<br>b.	Colorfastness, per AATCC 8-2005, 16-2004, 61-2006, and 15-2002<br>3.	Durability<br>a.	Abrasion resistance, per ASTM D 3884-07. Class I - 300 cycles without failure, Class II - 500 cycles without failure.<br>b.	Burst strength, per ASTM D 3787-07 (applies to knit materials only).  Class I & II - 50 lbf.<br>c.	Tear strength, per ASTM D 1424-07a (applies to woven & non-woven only).  Class I - Warp: 6 lbf (woven & non-woven), Fill: 4 lbf (woven only).  Class II - Warp: 9 lbf (woven & non-woven), Fill: 6 lbf (woven only).   <br>d.	Material breaking strength, per ASTM D 5034-95 (2001) (woven & non-woven only).  Class I & II - Warp: 160 lbf (woven), Fill: 80 lbf (woven), 160 lbf (nonwoven only).   <br>e.	Seam/closure breaking strength, ASTM D 5034-95 (2001). Class I - 45 lbf, Class II -  55 lbf <br>f.	Dimensional stability, per AATCC 135-2003<br>Technical testing data for the above criteria must be included in your response.  Data should include the test results, who performed the testing and when it was performed.  Complete testing reports are not required.  Materials that do not meet some of the above criteria will still be considered, if technical data is supplied identifying the level of the shortcoming.<br><br>III.	A candidate material shall meet one or more of the following protection capabilities.  The material protection capabilities will be defined by the following test methods:<br>1.	Blood borne pathogen resistance, per ASTM F 1671-3.<br>2.	Cut resistance, per ASTM F 1790-05. <br>3.	Flame resistance, per ASTM D 6413-99. <br>4.	Puncture resistance, per ASTM F 1342-05. <br>5.	Water repellency, per AATCC 22. <br>6.	Ultra Violet (UV) resistance, per AATCC 183-2004.<br>Responses must identify the protection capability(s) claimed.  Technical testing data that validates a protection capability must be included in your response.  Materials that do not meet the above criteria for a protection capability will still be considered, if technical data is supplied identifying the level of the protection shortcoming. <br><br>The information provided in response to this announcement will be evaluated by the program office.  Based on the technical data provided by each respondent, the program office will determine which materials may require additional test and evaluation.  The testing will characterize and verify the levels of comfort, appearance and durability as well as any protection performance capabilities.  The results of this program will be used by law enforcement to make informed decisions regarding the selection of materials for next generation duty uniforms.   <br><br>Because this material is not intended for a Department of Defense or a Department of Homeland Security application nor is the procurement of a law enforcement duty uniform subject to FEMA grant funding, this survey is open to all sources of textile material, both foreign and domestic, to include small businesses.

Test data, in accordance with the criteria mentioned above, to characterize the comfort, durability and appearance of the material. <br>3.	Test data, in accordance with the criteria mentioned above, to characterize the protection performance of the material.<br>4.	Indicate whether additional material is available for purchase and the lead time required for purchase.  <br>5.	Identify the sourcing (foreign or domestic) of the material.<br>6.

<CONTACT>Mary Kay Chase, Email Mary.Chase@dtra.mil
<DESC>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to award a single-source Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to the incumbent, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, 1880 Pratt Dr. STE 2006, Blacksburg, VA 24060-6750, with an ordering period of 5 years for task orders and a maximum performance of 1 year beyond the ordering period, to continue enhancements to and receive support from the Comprehensive National Incident Management System (CNIMS). The CNIMS is intended to provide a decision-support capability that's adaptable to a broad range of possible national (very large) scale crisis events using primary, secondary, and tertiary effects to determine recommendations for courses of action (reference attached Statement of Objectives). This notice is not a request for competitive proposals or a solicitation of offers. However, if a company has reason to believe that it can meet or exceed all the needs of DTRA for this requirement, it may submit documentation to support its claim, i.e., a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by this agency. Any response to this notice must provide clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements. In the absence of qualified sources, a contract will be awarded under the Other than Full and Open Competition procedures, pursuant to 10 United States Code (U.S.C.) 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source. Telephonic inquiries will not be accepted. The decision not to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the Government.&nbsp; Market research was conducted through a 2010 Sources Sought.&nbsp; Analysis of responses did not reflect any other than the incumbent as fully addressing the Sources Sought requirements, displaying knowledge in all critical co-evolving infrastructures, social and physical, and their interdependencies as well as course-of-action decision analyses. No other source addressed as adequately the experience with very large system-of-systems (hundreds of millions of entities), and scalability from small (tactical) to very large systems. This requirement is subject to the availability of funding.
<p>** All qualified sources must respond in writing no later than 5:00 PM (EDT), 23 May 2011, to DTRA/BE-BCRB, Attn: Mary Kay Chase, mary.chase@dtra.mil. Responses received after this date/time are considered untimely and shall not be considered. Any documentation received shall become the property of the Government.</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">ANSWER 27 - It is the government's intention to fund these positions as part of each individual technical task order/TAG and not establish a separate administrative task order/TAG just for these positions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since proposals will be evaluated on the total labor hour estimated ceiling price for all periods of performance, the Government will accept proposals using either the direct or indirect accounting method for charging the cost of the <span style="COLOR: black">Program Manager, Project Manager, and Security Specialist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Task Order funding is irrelevant to this question since the government will fund the task orders irrespective of how the contractor charges for labor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, offerors should charge these positions according to their established business and account practice so that the costs of these individuals will not be charged twice, both direct and indirect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If the offeror normally charges one or more of these positions as direct costs they should be proposed as direct costs in this proposal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If one or more of these positions is normally included in the offeror's overhead pool then they should be proposed as overhead employees and their costs included in the overhead burden applied to the other labor rates. </span></span></p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">ANSWER 28 - Offerors may provide a Performance Matrix with their proposal in cases where the proposal does not follow the same outline as the evaluation criteria.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of the performance matrix is to show, in concise table format, where the proposal addresses each area of the PWS.

All documents are available in .pdf format and may be viewed with the applicable version of Adobe Acrobat or Adobe Acrobat Professional.
Offers submitted in response to this Screening Information Request (SIR) will be evaluated using a tiered approach. Tiered evaluation of offers is a process by which FAA promotes small business participation while providing a means to continue the procurement if small business participation is insufficient.

Once offers are received, the FAA will evaluate a single tier of offers according to the order of precedence specified above. If no award can be made at the first tier, the evaluation will proceed to the next lower tier until award can be made.  As noted above, if applicable, Offerors must include their 8(a) or SDVOSB certification letters with their offers.  Interested parties responding to this solicitation are directed to the attached SIR.  All questions/inquires must be provided in writing to Kevin Hart kevin.hart@faa.gov no later than April 21, 2011 by 2:00 p.m. (EDT).  Offers are due no later than April 28, 2011 by 2:00 p.m. (EDT).  The FAA will not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to this solicitation. Therefore any cost associated with responding to this announcement is solely at the offeror's expense.  Prospective offerors are hereby on notice that any amendment(s) issued to this solicitation will be published at http://faaco.faa.gov/ under the current announcements for the FAA Headquarters.

The requirements are more fully described in the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW).  In order to determine which vendors have the required capabilities and expertise for the SOW requirements, the FAA requires interested Vendors to explain and describe their capabilities and recent past experience in performing in ALL functional areas listed in the attached OES Synopsis in their response.  The response should pertain only to contracts of a similar size and complexity as that represented per the draft statement of work provided with this announcement.  For purposes of this assessment, be advised that the estimated value of this procurement is $41M for a period of 5 years.
This public announcement is being issued in accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.3.11.  Interested parties are advised that:	This is not a SIR or Request for Proposals;	The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals;	The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred  in preparing the response to the market survey; and	Any costs associated with the market survey response submittals are solely at the interested party's expense.
Details of this announcement are listed below:
1.  PurposeThe purpose of this Market Survey is to: (1)	Ascertain industry capability and capacity levels for both small and large businesses relative to the functional areas cited, and to improve the Government understanding of the current marketplace to identify qualified and capable sources to perform the services described in the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW).  (2)	Survey the marketplace to assess the level of interest among qualified service providers (small or large businesses) of the required services.
2.  Description of the Required ServicesThe FAA ATO Finance Services Office of Enterprise Solutions Group's primary objective is to select and implement resource management efficiencies via performance-based business solutions and targeted acquisitions.  This is accomplished through studies and analyses of resources, systems, policies, procedures, technical operations, and organizational structure.  This, in turn, leads to more comprehensive acquisition planning, resource planning, and business process re-engineering.
The contractor will provide a broad range of support services relating to Staffing Standards and Schedule Optimization Analysis, Resource Planning and Analysis, Financial Analysis, Business Process Re-engineering (BPR), Acquisition Planning, Implementation and Transition, Performance Metric Development and Monitoring, Strategic Planning and Policy Development. The requirements are more fully described in the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW).  
3.  NAICS CodeThe North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for these requirements is 541611 Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services with a size standard of $7 Million. 
4.  Responses to the Market SurveyInterested parties should submit the following information in response to this Market Survey by May 16, 2011.(a)	A one-page letter of transmittal. (b)	A statement of capabilities and past experience not to exceed eight pages (12 point Times New Roman font or similar with 1 inch margins or greater) that address your company's capabilities and past experience for each of the following eight functional areas:  -  Staffing Standards and Schedule Optimization Analysis, -  Resource Planning and Analysis, -  Financial Analysis, -  Business Process Re-engineering (BPR), -  Acquisition Planning, -  Implementation and Transition, -  Performance Metric Development and Monitoring, -  Strategic Planning and Policy Development 
Your response should address each of the eight functional areas in the same order as shown above and should address both your capabilities and capacity.  Capacity should be addressed in terms of the size of your company (FTEs and revenue) as well as in the specific past experiences (previous contracts) described in the response for each functional area.  For any of the eight functional areas where your company has no capability, capacity and/or past experience the response should clearly identify this lack of capability, capacity and/or past experience.  


The response should also address:  
	A list of contracts under which your company has provided these types of services in the past 5 years including the name of the contract, client, your company's staffing level on the contract (# of FTEs), contract total price or value, your company's percentage of the total staffing on the contract, and your company's role on the contract (prime or subcontractor). 	Number of years your company has been in business.	Geographical areas where your company can provide the noted services without charging the government any long distance travel costs.   The government plans for all work to be accomplished in the Washington DC Metropolitan area and does not intend to pay long-distance travel expenses. (c) A completed and signed Business Declaration Form attached to this Market Survey.
For purposes of this market research effort, should a response be vague or unclear with respect to capability, capacity and/or past experience in any of the eight areas, the government will conclude that the responder lacks capability and/or capacity in that specific area to perform these services at the noted anticipated size and level of complexity (as depicted per the draft SOW and estimated value).   
If any of the information submitted is considered to be proprietary or business sensitive, the submitter is responsible for marking it accordingly. 
Please indicate whether or not your firm would like to be included on the List of Interested Parties for this requirement.  The FAA will publish this List of Interested Parties to facilitate the subcontracting process between the potential prime offerors and potential subcontractors.

<DESC><strong>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)</strong>
<p>Original Release Date: April 6, 2011<br />Administrative Update Release Date: April 20, 2011</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. <br />NO PROPOSALS ARE SOUGHT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>***EXTENSION: Any responses to this RFI should be submitted by May 2, 2011 at 11:00 AM EST.***</strong></p>
<p>This notice consists of three parts:</p>
<p>Part I. Introduction<br />Part II. List of Attachments<br />Part III. How to Respond to this Notice</p>
<p>I. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>This notice is a Request for Information (RFI). It is for information and planning purposes and does NOT constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). It is issued under the authority of FAR 15.201 ("Exchanges of information before receipt of proposals"). FAR 11.101 ("Order of precedence for requirements documents") requires agencies to develop requirements documents to meet agency needs that utilize performance-oriented documents based on voluntary industry consensus standards to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p>FAR Subpart 37.6, and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy's (OFPP) "A Guide to Best Practices for Performance-Based Service Contracting"(Oct. 1998), encourage agencies to use performance-based contracting methods that describe work requirements in terms of results required rather than the methods of performance of the work, establish objective measurable performance standards for key elements of the work, use a quality assurance surveillance plan (QASP) to measure work accomplishment against the standards, and use performance incentives to encourage contractors to meet and/or exceed the referenced standards.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has directed agencies to take immediate action to govern the appropriate use and oversight of contract types to minimize risk and maximize the value of Government contracts. OFPP's memorandum "Increasing Competition and Structuring Contracts for Best Results" (Oct. 2009) encourages agencies to collaborate with industry, use performance-based acquisitions, choose the best contract type for acquisitions, and use incentives to motivate lower costs in cost-type arrangements.</p>
<p>These referenced documents may be accessed electronically at the OFPP website located at <br />http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/procurement/. Please frame any responses to this notice in accordance with the policies contained in these references.</p>
<p>II. LIST OF ATTACHMENTS</p>
<p>Please review and respond to the following list of attachments:</p>
<p>Attachment 1: Questions<br />Attachment 2: Statement of Objectives (SOO)<br />Attachment 3: IHSC EHR Functional Requirements<br />Attachment 4: IHSC EHR Workflows<br />Attachment 5: Clinical Definitions<br />Attachment 6: Work Breakdown Structure</p>

Please submit the information in the same order and using the same numbering scheme in this notice to facilitate evaluation and organization by Government reviewers.

<p>Replies will be separated from, and have no bearing on, subsequent evaluation of proposals submitted in response to any resulting formal Requests for Proposals (RFPs). The use of information received in response to this notice may be used by ICE for acquisition planning and solicitation preparation activities. Eligibility in participating in a future acquisition does not depend upon a response to this notice. ICE will not critique the responses to this notice and the notice should not be used by Offerors to market their products/services. ICE does not intend to pay for the information solicited and will not recognize any costs associated with responding to this RFI. Proprietary information is neither sought nor desired by ICE.

<DESC>Modification 1:

The pre-solicitation notice issued on September 2, 2010 is modified to include the following:

1.  Contractors' questions and Government responses are provided in the attached file for information purposes.

2.  The third paragraph is changed to read:
 
"Planned projects include, but are not limited to, new construction and repair and alteration of base development facilities (including, but not limited to, barracks, dormitories, and administrative facilities)." 

3.  Selection criteria 1, Specialized Experience, is changed to read:

"Firm's demonstrated recent experience with regard to design of base development facilities including performing Design Charrettes/Functional Analysis Concept Developments (FACD) and preparation of design-build and design-bid-build contract documents similar in size, complexity, and dollar value (approximately $50-100 million or more in construction value [FY09 dollars] per project/contract).
  Base development facilities include, but are not limited to, barracks, dormitories, and administrative facilities.  Individual features (barracks, dormitories, and administrative facilities) do not have to be within a single project scope; however, projects that contain several or all features may be given more favorable consideration than projects that contain only individual features.  Also, base development projects designed and constructed in environments similar to Guam (remoteness, corrosiveness, etc.) will be considered more favorably.  List a maximum of ten (10) relevant projects completed in the past ten (10) years which best describe experience in design of base development projects discussed above.
  A project or contract is defined as either a stand-alone contract or a single task order in an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract having the features described above.


4.  There is no change to the response date/time of October 6, 2010, 2:00 p.m., Hawaii Standard Time.
