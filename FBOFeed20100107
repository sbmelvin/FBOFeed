To support its general project planning activities, Reclamation is acquiring detailed terrain data for the extent of the Klamath Project acquired using airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology.  Reclamation intends to use the data for planning studies to address water conservation, dam and canals of concern, safety, and operations and maintenance issues on the project.
Contractor shall acquire LiDAR terrain data for the Klamath Project service area lands located in south-central Oregon and northern California. The approximate total area for these project areas is 750 square miles. Data will be acquired in January 2010 through June 2011 to capture ground conditions with minimal snow cover.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for aninflatable reentry vehicle test article for the Inflatable Reentry Vehicle Experiment(IRVE) - 3 project and potentially other inflatable analysis and development.	Recentsystems analysis studies indicate that inflatable aeroshells are an enabling technologyfor high mass Mars systems. On August 17, 2009, the IRVE-II project (with a 2.93m (115in)inflatable aeroshell) was launched on a sounding rocket out of Wallops Flight Facility(WFF), with a goal of demonstrating the concept of inflatable reentry vehicles. Duringthe IRVE-II flight, the aeroshell inflated as designed and maintained stability not onlythrough hypersonic reentry but also through the supersonic, transonic and subsonic flightregimes.  With this IRVE-II proof-of-concept demonstration, the next logical step is aflight test to increase the heat flux on the inflatable to get closer to a moreoperationally realistic flight environment.NASA LaRC, in conjunction with the Fundamental Aerodynamics Program Hypersonics Project,has initiated IRVE-3 which will build on both IRVE-II and ongoing ground-baseddevelopments, with a primary goal of 5X to 10X higher heat flux than IRVE-II (which was2W/cm2).  IRVE-3 will be launched on a Black Brant XI with a 22in (0.55m) shroud.  Thetarget ballistic number of the reentry vehicle is double that of IRVE-II, so the payloadbeing decelerated by the aeroshell will be roughly 200kg (441lb), more than the massallocated for the aeroshell.  Preliminary estimates of the peak deceleration are on theorder of 25g. Using the initially estimated 25g deceleration value and the 200kgcenterbody mass estimate the preliminary aeroshell/payload interface loading is estimatedto be 49kN (11klbf).  Components of the inflatable aeroshell will include: InflatableStructure, Thermal Protection System, Restraint System, and Instrumentation.The contractor shall be responsible for the design, fabrication, structural analysis, andtesting of the inflatable aeroshell (both an engineering development unit as well as aflight article) as an integrated system, as well as support integration of the flightarticle to the rest of the inflatable reentry vehicle and support of IRVE-3 systemtesting. While the statement of work outlined in the upcoming RFP will produce aninflatable article more capable than is required for the flight environment of thisparticular mission, the intent is to feed-forward this technology/capability developmentto flight that will expose the components to more severe environments.This procurement action is intended to result in a performance based contract.

<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE
Response Date:	January 21, 2010
Synopsis:
PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED. This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), intends to competitively award a contract entitled Social Indicators in the North Aleutian Basin.  The MMS, Procurement Operations Branch, is the contracting office for this procurement and the resultant contract administration.  All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov) in order to receive Government contracts.  The Government intends to award a fixed price contract for the effort described herein.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541990 - All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services and 541620  Environmental Consulting Services.  The contractor must be capable of performing all of the tasks described in the subsequent Request for Proposal which are summarized herein.  The period of performance of the resultant contract is anticipated to be not more than 36 months, with an estimated cost range of $250,000 -  $280,000.  
BACKGROUND:The United States Congress, through the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) and its subsequent amendments, requires the Secretary of the Department of the Interior to monitor and assess the impacts of resource development activities in federal waters on human, marine, and coastal environments.  The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 further requires that natural and social science research be conducted to inform major environmental policy actions and decisions.  OCSLA Amendments of 1978 (92 Stat. 629) established a policy for the management of oil and natural gas in the OCS and for protection of the marine and coastal environments.  The amendments authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct studies in areas or regions of sales to ascertain the "environmental impacts on the marine and coastal environments of the outer Continental Shelf and the coastal areas which may be affected by oil and gas development" (43 U.S.C. 1346).  The Minerals Management Service (MMS) is the federal administrative agency created both to conduct OCS lease sales and to monitor and mitigate adverse impacts that might be associated with offshore resource development.  Within MMS, the Environmental Studies Program functions to implement and manage the responsibilities of research.  Within the NAB planning area, the Department of the Interiors Final OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program 2007-2012 includes Lease Sale 214, scheduled to occur in 2011.  The study will be available in subsequent NEPA documents addressing exploration and development.
In preparation for a potential Lease Sale 214, the MMS sponsored the NAB Information Status and Research Planning Meeting in 2006 to solicit input from a broad range of scientific experts and regional stakeholders who could assist with development of research planning strategies.  The meeting identified 35 study profiles that could provide useful information for future NEPA Environmental Impact Statements, analysis of potential mitigation of impacts, and post-sale needs, such as for use in NEPA reviews of exploration or development plans.  Of those, this social indicator study has been identified by the Alaska OCS Region as meeting a time-sensitive information need.
PURPOSE:
This study constitutes a key component of environmental studies pertinent to the proposed Lease Sale 214 in the North Aleutian Basin (NAB).  Specifically, this study will provide socioeconomic baseline data for analysis of potential local and regional impacts from offshore exploration and development activities that may occur in federal waters along the Aleutian Chain.  The information from this study will be used for Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) analysis and documentation and long-term monitoring for the NAB oil and gas exploration and development in the region.
SCOPE OF WORK:The objective is to provide baseline information on regional socioeconomic conditions from which government officials and stakeholders can monitor and evaluate potential changes in well-being resulting from oil and gas exploration and development.  To achieve this goal, this study will identify selected quantitative measures of lifestyle qualities among the selected communities in the NAB, and provide insight into potential impacts to economic well-being, health and safety, cultural continuity, public services, physical environment, and education.  This study will also provide new key information on socioeconomic conditions and processes of change for evaluation by government officials in future leasing decisions and review of exploration and development scenarios and plans.  The tasks included in this procurement include:
1.	Formulate Research Design Includes a detailed plan of work and schedule to achieve goals of study, and research design, which will adopt and make explicit in a theoretical framework and hypothesis testing strategy to guide in the formulation of the survey instrument.  Due one month after project start-up. 
2.	Community Engagement - Engage community to discuss the Social Indicator Survey, domains, proposed indicators, and obtain a written protocol from local entity re-engaging community participation and meaningful community goal.  Due at end of month four after contract award. 
3.	Literature search and review needs to be focused and thorough to assess the current state of knowledge about key social indicators and their relevance to monitoring in the NAB.  Due at the end of month four. 
4.	Develop Social Indicator Domains - Compile data, identify data gaps, and develop indicator domains.  Determine which specific indicators must be obtained through collection of data with a survey instrument.  Using criteria found in the RFP statement of work, identify three to five social indicators per domain that will be addressed in a formal planning meeting the MMS.  Complete by end of month six. 
5.	Survey Design and Approval - Design, pre-test, and gain approval from the Office of Management and Budget for a formal survey instrument to collect information on the social indicator domains.  Survey instrument by end of month six, pre-test and report by end of month eight.  Revisions of survey instrument as needed, submission by end of month nine. 
6.	Administer Survey Instrument - Upon OMB approval of the information collection request, conduct survey by end of month twenty-one.  Manage, code, and record data by end of month twenty-four. 7.

<DESC>Advance Planning Notice for Informational Purposes Only
PR#: N00421-09-R-0119

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL

Scope: The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) anticipates a requirement for Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) supplies and incidental services to support the Aircraft Prototype Systems Division, Code 5.2.8, which operates under the umbrella of the Range Department’s Air Vehicle Modification and Instrumentation (AVMI) Department. Contractor support is required for the Air Vehicle Modification and Instrumentation’s (AVMI’s) Aircraft Prototype Systems Division (APSD) Aircraft Prototype Facility (APF) and Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWC-AD) prototype programs. The APF consists of a small standing Government staff to support a wide variety of transient customers. The APF is designed to house a diversity of projects, requiring security protection beginning at General Secret and ranging upward to Top Secret. Platforms will include, but are not limited to F/A-18, E-2, V-22, EA-6B, Unstaffed Air Vehicles of many varieties, and the SH-60. The concept of operations for the APSD, supported by the APF is as follows: Upon receipt of a work order or tasking, the APSD will form focused, government lead and directed teams to support customer requirements, with the typical product being a prototype, validation and verification system or unit, with a set of engineering drawings and data sufficient to perform large quantity replication of the system or unit. To meet critical fleet needs, APSD will often be called upon to produce limited supplies of such systems or units to fill the need while larger production contracts (outside of the scope of this contract) are put into place. See attached draft Performance-Based Statement of Work for further information. The resulting contract vehicle will be a Performance-Based, Cost-Plus-fixed-Fee (CPFF)/Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The estimated period of performance is 5 years. 

Incumbent: This is a new requirement. 

Set-Aside: 
100% Small Business Set-Aside

Contract Type:
An IDIQ contract is planned as a Performance Based contract inclusive of CPFF and FFP CLINs. NAICS code is 336413.

Attachments:
Draft Statement of Work

Milestones:
NAVAIR anticipates procurement milestones to occur on or around the following dates.
Solicitation Issued: 22 Jan 2010
Contract Award: 15 May 2010

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) Orlando intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a Contract for the procurement of seven Flight Training Devices (FTDs) and Baseline Configuration Updates (BCUs) to the four fielded UH-1Y/AH-1Z flight simulators with Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. (BHTI), Ft. Worth, TX. under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".  Currently, the only source of the design and software is BHTI.  The anticipated contract value for this contract is $150M inclusive of all options. 

The H-1 Flight Simulator contract will provide for the acquisition of four UH-1Y FTDs and three AH-1Z FTDs, and the modification and upgrades of four fielded H-1 flight simulators.  Specifically, the modification and upgrades effort is for one each UH-1Y and AH-1Z FTD, and one each UH-1Y and AH-1Z Full Flight Simulator (FFS) to technically refresh and maintain simulation concurrency with USMC platforms and continue supporting Training & Readiness Syllabus requirements for joint training.

USMC aircrew training systems require maximizing capabilities amongst platforms.  The H-1 contract will also provide for upgrades and modifications for Mission Computer Software Configuration Set (SCS) currency, USMC Aviation Training System interoperability, Brief/Debrief Stations, image generators and visual databases.  The H-1 training systems’ requirements identified will support training in the full mission spectrum from planning through mission rehearsal including individual through joint interoperability levels encompassing events in the initial Rotary Wing Training and Readiness Matrix (T&R).  Any new UH-1Y/AH-1Z training systems, modifications and upgrades must be fully integrated and interoperable with the currently fielded UH-1Y/AH-1Z aircraft and require the use of technical information that is not readily available to other contractors during design and development as the Government has neither the intellectual property rights nor data necessary to provide to another contractor.  The UH-1Y/AH-1Z contract will also focus on reducing cost of ownership by optimizing existing hardware and software commonality across all H-1 FTD/FFS devices through the extensive use of common interfaces, data structures, hardware and software constructs.  Award to any other contractor would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that would not be recovered through competition for the remaining devices to be procured and would create unacceptable delays in fulfilling UH-1Y mission training requirements and having adequate training devices delivered in time to support Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for the AH-1Z aircraft scheduled for 3rd quarter FY11.   A competitive acquisition would allow for a new system to be introduced to the field that may not be integrated and interoperable with the existing eight training devices. This would require the Government to have two infrastructures in place for life cycle support or would require a significant rework of the current FTD/FFS design and development that would cost the Government additional non-recurring engineering (NRE) effort for first article development, testing, and retrofit of existing FTDs/FFSs.  As the current sole designer, developer, integrator, manufacturer and supplier of USMC UH-1Y and AH-1Z aircrew training systems and hardware and software components that are common to the UH-1Y and AH-1Z, only BHTI possesses the requisite knowledge, engineering expertise, and data rights of the design required to design, build, modify, upgrade and deliver UH-1Y and AH-1Z aircrew training systems. 

This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals. It is a notice that outlines the Government’s intent to contract on a sole source basis with BHTI.  However, interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  In doing so, interested sources must submit detailed technical capabilities, ability to obtain UH-1Y and AH-1Z aircraft elements and simulation technical data, and any other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the needs of the Government.  Detailed capabilities must be submitted by email to Ms. Mona Zahid (mona.zahid@navy.mil) in an electronic format that is compatible with Word 2003, no later than 22 January 2010. All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government. Responses shall be limited to no more than TEN (10) pages. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This synopsis is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals.  No solicitation document is available. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the Government. If no affirmative written response is received, the Contract for the UH-1Y/AH-1Z aircrew training devices will be awarded without further notice prior to award.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, Norfolk Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office intends to procure Diversity Training Services in support of the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED), Washington, DC.  The BUMED Diversity Office was created and tasked with developing long term strategies and program guidance for Navy medical communities and their constituents.  This multifaceted program includes training, recruitment, research, college student internship programs, outreach to students in Kindergarten through twelfth grade, and collaborating with affinity organizations to gain access and influence into new areas that could potentially produce future Navy Medicine accessions.  The objective of the BUMED Diversity program is to train personnel on the true definition of "diversity" and provide guidelines on how to manage diversity within Navy Medicine commands.  Also, BUMED plans to provide training for 90% of the personnel who work in Navy Medicine within a four-year period and provide ongoing training to Navy leaders via the officer and enlisted leadership classes offered at Navy Medicine Personnel, Training and Education (NMPT&E)
The proposed procurement is being processed as 100% Small Business Set-Aside.  The placement of a firm fixed price contract in accordance with FAR 13.5, Test Program Procedures for Certain Commercial Items, is anticipated.  The Period of Performance is from 01 February 2010 through 31 January 2010, plus four one-year options ending 31 January 2015, if all options are exercised.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office announces the intent to contract directly with Apogee Solutions, Inc. (Apogee) of Chesapeake, VA for a requirement for an increase in Clinical Support Staff services in support of the Marine Corps Wounded Warrior Operations Center (WWOC) located in Quantico, VA, as well as additional services to support a new location for the Wounded Warrior Battalion West, Hawaii Company. Under Contract Number N00189-08-C-Z109, Apogee is currently providing the same services to support the Wounded Warrior Regiment at the Wounded Warrior Battalions East and West (WWBN-E/WWDN-W) (Camp LeJeune and Camp Pendleton) and the WWOC in Quantico.   The Contract was competitively awarded to Apogee on 29 September 2008.  The additional work can best be provided by Apogee, so that all Wounded Warrior Regiment Clinical Support Staff services can be centrally managed and consistently provided at the various locations by a single source.  Competition of the requirement and award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of effort and costs to the Government, and would result in disjointed management and provision of the program.  Therefore, it is logical and in the best interest of the Government to include this additional work in the existing Contract through a change to the Performance Work Statement (PWS) and an increase to the FFP value of the Contract.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by the specified response date.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals.  However, the Government will consider information received by the specified response date.  Information received as a result of this notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government will not pay for information submitted in response to this notice.

<DESC>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research & Development (ORD) is seeking contractor support on a requirement entitled Recovery & Reuse of Metals from Mining Influenced Water. This requirement involves removing metals from mining influenced water in a form that would allow for reuse. The Rocky Mountains host thousands of abandoned mines with exposed metals-laden rock. Interaction of water with these rocks has resulted in acidic rock drainage and other environmental problems, including the potential for severe damage to the aquatic ecosystems posing a potential threat to human health. Water treatment facilities are in use in this region to extract heavy metals such that water will not cause further problems downstream. However, these treatment facilities are expensive and generate large quantities of sludge resulting in additional mining activities to acquire these metals for new production.
The purpose of this research project is to address the challenges of removing metals from mining influenced water in a form that would allow for reuse of the metals thus reducing operations and maintenance costs at the mines by decreasing the volume of sludge requiring disposal. This project includes a research component for this study with modifications to an existing technology to meet the goals/objectives. Water chemistry parameters (pH, alkalinity (low), hardness (high), ionic strength (generally high), temperature (high altitude locations), and rapid precipitation of iron oxyhydroxides) vary in mining-influenced watersheds, possibly causing an existing technology to require these alterations. While non-alkaline-chemical treatment technologies exist for removal of metals from mining-influenced water, few field implementations are known for the use of treating acid-mine drainage water for reuse. 
The EPA is seeking a contractor to (1) use existing technology in a 2 month field pilot study to attain a reduction in waste sludge of at least 30% relative to traditional chemical treatments (e.g., final water content of 25% or less) with a 95-99% recovery efficiency for target metals (Al, Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn), and an effluent water having metals concentrations at or below water standards, (2) make the technology pilot ready within the first 6 months of the project start date, and (3) find a smelter that will accept the material created for recovery and reuse of the metals. 
The Government anticipates award of a firm-fixed price (FFP) contract to span a maximum 2 year duration.  We anticipate that the solicitation will be posted for 30 days beginning in November (will change to late January). The solicitation will be issued on a full and open competitive basis, with no small business set-aside. A copy of the solicitation will be available at the following location: http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/. Interested parties are expected to download the solicitation and subsequent amendments from the website and to monitor the status of the RFP. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by EPA. Contract award will be made in accordance with FAR part 15-Contracting by Negotiation. The point of contact is Nicole Modafari, Contract Specialist, at 513-487- 2001, Modafari.Nicole@epa.gov.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Office of Procurement Operations (OPO), intends to issue a sole source contract to Roche Labs, 340 Kingsland Street, Nutley, NJ 07110 for the antiviral medicine Oseltamivir (trade name Tamiflu), by other than full and open competition, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1. This is not a request for a proposal. A solicitation will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. DHS, Office of Health Affairs (OHA), requires this antiviral medicine for the DHS Antiviral Stockpile for pandemic and avian influenza preparedness.&nbsp;&nbsp;The stockpile is needed in order to have a readily available supply of medicine to protect DHS personnel in the event of a pandemic to ensure the continuity of its essential services and overall critical mission. The medicine must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration and demonstrated by the Centers for Disease Control to be effective in treating Influenza A, H1N1 Influenza and H5N1 Avian Influenza. The medicine must also be able to be administered orally in the form of a pill or capsule. Packaging and labeling specifications of this antiviral medicine are as follows: Each Tamiflu capsule shall contain 75 mg of oseltamivir phosphate. Each package shall contain capsules sufficient for one course (5 days treatment or 10 days prophylaxis). Product packaging shall be in accordance with Health and Human Services (HHS) Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) packaging. Product labeling shall be in accordance with HHS SNS labeling. The ordering period of the resulting contract will include a 12-month base and four (4) 12-month options. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."&nbsp; CDC regards zanamivir (trade name Relenza), produced by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), as a proven effective alternative to oseltamivir (Tamiflu) in the treatment and prevention of influenza. However, there is a proportion of the human population that can not take Relenza due to its delivery system (oral inhalation). Therefore, some people will require the antiviral medicine to be administered orally.&nbsp; Tamiflu is the only antiviral medicine shown to be effective that comes in the form of gel-caps. Market research has shown that no other known contractors presently exist who could get the necessary CDC/FDA approvals to produce the product in sufficient quantities and deliver it in time to meet the current requirement. A redacted copy of the justification prepared for this procurement is included with this notice pursuant to the requirements of FAR 5.102(a)(6). Based on the aforementioned facts and the statutory authority at FAR 6.302-1, the Government intends to award a single non-competitive contract to Roche Labs for this medicine after March 12, 2010.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Establish and maintain business relationships with Russian subcontractors to act as pay agents under the provisions of the Joint Arrangement for the Completion of the Chemical Weapons Destruction Facility near Shchuchye Russia (JACC)<BR>b. Provide verification of completed work under Russian awarded trilateral government contracts in accordance with the JACC.<BR>c. Provide the necessary financial arrangements, tracking, and reporting to provide timely payment for invoices received from the Russian government to the Russian trilateral contractors.<BR><BR>For the purposes of this notice, both small and large businesses should provide responses.  The contract addressed by this notice will provide service in the Russian Federation. Firms will be selected for negotiations based on demonstrated competence and professional qualifications for the required work.   The contract will consist of five ordering periods, one base year plus four 1-year options, for a total of five years maximum.   The Government anticipates the award of one contract for this requirement.  The Government further anticipates a contract capacity of approximately $1M to $50M. The selected firms must be able to execute two or more simultaneous task orders ranging in value from $10 Thousand to $1 Million.  Work will be issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price task orders.  The initial contract is anticipated to be awarded in Fiscal Year 2010. <BR><BR>The Huntsville Center, USACE, intends to solicit and award one ID/IQ contract for establishment of a core team of technical experts in Russia to provide technical support and oversight verification and payment of Russian trilateral contracts.  It is the Governments intent to consider awarding a portion of this acquisition to small businesses.  As a result, the Government is performing market research in order to determine if small businesses possess the capability to execute some or all of the requirements within this acquisition. Respondents need to indicate all small business set-aside designations (small business, 8(a), certified HUBZone and/or Service Disabled Veteran Owned). <BR><BR>All interested firms who meet the capability requirements identified in this notice are requested to reply to this e-mail with a response to the questions presented below.  If no experience or capabilities are associated with a particular question, so indicate.  Based upon small business responses received, consideration will be given to defining what part of the acquisition, if any, will be set-aside for small business competition.<BR> <BR>2. PROJECT INFORMATION <BR><BR>The Russian Federation (RF) began CWDF chemical agent destruction operations at the Shchuchye CWDF in March 2009.  The U.S. Government (USG) is presently performing trilateral contract verification and payment for completed work and technical support with the authorization of the RF to assure continued operations as the RF systemizes the facility during hot operations.  During facility systemization and subsequent initial start up, technical issues may arise that will require resolution in a prompt and timely manner. The issues may relate to equipment malfunctions, failures, request for additional spare parts, or other technical issues relating to bringing the facility to full operations.  This technical support is also expected to productively address potential problems and reduce operational risk.  Anyone may identify an issue, but the RF must request support for the item to be managed as follows:<BR>a. Identification of Issue:  The RF identifies a technical issue and conveys it the contractor.  The issue may initially be conveyed verbally, telephonically, by email, or by a formal letter requesting assistance in resolving a technical issue.<BR>b. Tracking:  Create a tracking item for the newly identified technical issue immediately after a preliminary verification and assessment of the technical request. <BR>c. Inspection: The contractor shall review the technical issue, obtain additional information from the site, if necessary prepare a report and convey to all the members of the team, detailed information regarding the technical issue. <BR>d. US Government Notification:  The contractor and USG will meet to assess the available information and reach agreement on the path forward.  Based on the urgency of the need and the number of ongoing issues, this meeting may be held daily or on an as needed basis. The latest update on each issue will be provided during the meeting and any change in the current path forward, if needed, will also be determined during these meetings.  The USG shall provide concurrence for use of USG funds for the item created prior to proceeding with further action.<BR>e. Vendor Support: If it becomes evident that outside vendor support will be needed to resolve the technical issue, the contractor will initiate discussions with the vendor. These initial discussions will ensure that the vendor fully understands the issues needing resolution and, if needed, a suitable specialist comes to the site fully prepared to work on the issue. <BR>f. Procurement:  Based on the recommendations of the team, should a procurement action result, the contractor will initiate the procurement and follow the procurement action through until the action is satisfactorily completed.<BR><BR>Subject to funding constraints, the USG is continuing to provide verification and payment actions for RF awarded trilateral government contracts.  This support involves establishing a subcontract relationship with a Russian contractor who will act as an agent and sign RF awarded trilateral government contracts as the Payer.  This sub-contractor will receive invoices from the RF for completed work, verify their accuracy and pass them to the USG contractor for verification of work and payment.  The USG contractor will physically verify the completed work and provide payment for the invoice through their subcontractor Russian agent.<BR><BR>3. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS<BR>The decision to reserve award(s) for qualified small business under a single award acquisition is being considered pending the evaluation of responses to this sources sought announcement.  The Government is seeking to identify qualified sources under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541330, Engineering Services either singly or as part of an assembled team.

<DESC>An SMC A-AS Industry Day is scheduled 19 January 2010, 1:00pm PST, at the Gordon Conference Center, Room&nbsp;1, 483 N Aviation Blvd, Building 270 (1st Floor), Los Angeles AFB CA 90245-2808. Due to limited accommodations, interested primes are requested to limit company participation to 2 members maximum. Current and potential team members are requested to limit company participation to 1 member. Each attendee must register NLT 4:00 PM PST, 15 January 2010 at the following website:<br /><br /><a href="https://einvitations.afit.edu/SMCPI/anim.cfm">https://einvitations.afit.edu/SMCPI/anim.cfm</a>. <br /><br />Each interested prime and team member (current or potential) is requested to provide one completed questionnaire (enclosed) by the end of the forum.&nbsp; At the soonest available opportunity a draft performance work statement (PWS) will be provided under an FBO update or handed out at the forum at the latest.<br /><br />
<p>Background. The Space and Missile Systems Center, Los Angeles Air Force Base, CA is in the midst of planning a follow-on acquisition to replace the SMC Financial Support (SFS) and SMC Acquisition Support (SAS) programs for Advisory &amp; Assisted Services (A-AS). The SFS program provides financial, cost management, schedule management, and related training A-AS support to SMC organizations. The SAS program provides manpower, personnel, administration, configuration/data management, acquisition planning, contracting and associated training A-AS support. Both programs awarded task orders under FAR 8 Fair Opportunity business rules via SMC Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) based upon GSA Professional Engineering Services (PES), Schedule 871, contracts. This work was set-aside for small business BPA holders with less than 1,000 employees consistent with NAICS code 541710 (circa 2002). Both programs are expected to complete by mid calendar year 2011.</p>
<p>Follow-On. SMC anticipates a single follow-on acquisition reserved for small business that integrates the functionalities of SFS and SAS. The SMC A-AS Industry Day is intended to augment market research activities to form the basis for the acquisition strategy. To the maximum extent possible, contract type is anticipated as Firm-Fixed Price. It is unknown if SMC will continue its FAR 8 BPA GSA schedule implementation or establish FAR 15 IDIQ or other type contracts. Consistent with past practices, the Government is discerning the use of NAICS code 541712 (associated with GSA PES). However, NAICS code 541611 (associated with GSA MOBIS) is being investigated as an alternative under a BPA strategy. The follow-on acquisition is expected to be ready for the commencement of work by July 2011.</p>
<p>C2C. Coupled to this acquisition, it is anticipated that SMC Contractor to Civilian Conversion (C2C) activities will directly impact effort on this program. The goal of C2C is to convert contracted A-AS support to Government civilian staffing. The SMC C2C plan is currently at the pre-decisional stage. Its completion, implementation, magnitude, and phasing are TBD.</p>

TAS: 14 1263 0000
United States Department of the InteriorJustification of Other than Full and Open Competition Under $25,000
1) Briefly, a description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs and include the estimated value.The Museum will provide curation services for nine cubic feet of human remains and associated artifacts and grave goods from the Alaska Maritime National Widlife Refuge. It will also provide curation services for 29 feet of faunal remains from the Kodiak National Widlife Refuge.
2)  Statutory Authority  permitting other than full and open competition. Identify the statutory authority permitting with the FAR citation and FAR citation Title. FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 
3) WHY are the proposed contractor's unique qualifications for the nature of the acquisition requiring the use of the authority cited in item (2). The Burke Museum is the only repository which meets Federal curation guidelines spelled out in 36 CFR 79 and is willing to take large collections of faunal materials. Some of these collections were deposited with the Burke Museum in the late 1970s. Recently, the Museum has become the primary repository for faunal remains from prehistoric sites in Kodiak. In addition to their value for understanding human use and adaptation, these collections are a priceless record for understanding environmental change over the last 8,000 years. The legal authorities cited above require archaeological collections from federal lands to be curated in repositories meeting stringent standards for physical security, staffing, and public access. The Museum has the space, technical expertise, and staffing to properly care for these collections.
4) WHAT effort was made to ensure that offers were solicited from as many potential sources as is practical. The University of Alaska-Fairbanks, Museum of the Aleutians, and Alutiiq Museum have declined to accept and curate these specific collections.
5) A Description of the Market survey conducted and the results. Discussions between cooperators and fellow colleagues produces no other alternative sources to consider.

<p>The purpose of this Work Assignment is to obligate $5,000.00 for the eligible tribal LUST PHW Texaco/Honanis Auto Repair Hopi Tribe (HOPI 0017) project. The period of performance for this work is from January 6, 2010 to September 28, 2011. Site activities will include the sampling and analysis of soil and potential groundwater, if encountered. In addition, all UST's associated piping and other related equipment shall be removed from the site to facilitate adequate sampling. Between 20 to 30 cubic yards of soil may be removed from this site. This work assignment may be amended with additional funding for additional site assessment activities, if necessary. The site is located on Hopi Tribe Trust Land near Second Mesa, Arizona in Navajo County.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Underground Storage Tank (OUST) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OUST contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OUST contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<p>The purpose of this Work Assignment is to obligate $5,000.00 for the eligible tribal LUST Polacca Coach's Store Site Hopi Tribe (HOPI 035) project.

In addition, all UST's associated piping and other related equipment shall be removed from the site to facilitate adequate sampling. Between 10 to 15 cubic yards of soil may be removed from this site. Soil samples and or groundwater samples may be needed to further assess the site even without the removal of the UST system.

Although the Agency's Office of Underground Storage Tank (OUST) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OUST contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OUST contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this sole-source synopsis is to announce the revision of the contract maximum order amount on one of the Acquisition, Logistics, Management and Business Operations Support (ALMBOS) contracts. USZA22-02-D-0014 was awarded to Sverdrup Technology Incorporated (now Jacobs Technology Incorporated), as one of two Multiple Award, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity, Award Term contracts in December 2001. The contract currently expires on 30 April 2010. The contract provides intellectual capital support in the areas of system acquisition and development. This contract also provides for a wide array of critical support such as Senior Military Planners, Plans Analysts, Intelligence Managers, Senior Psychological Operations Process Analysts, and Technology Experts in support of USSOCOM Headquarters, Service Components (Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps), and Theater Special Operations Commands that provide direct support to Special Operations Forces. To continue the critical support available under this contract, it is necessary to increase the maximum order amount of USZA22-02-D-0014 by $50M (from $460M to $510M); as well as, an increase of $25M (from $45M to $70M),of ceiling availability to be invoked in the event the Government exercises the Extension of Services clause. This action is necessary due to an accelerated pace of contract requirements in response to the further expansion of USSOCOM's operational tempo as it prosecutes Overseas Contingency Operations. More importantly, in order to ensure a seamless transition period between the existing contact and the follow-on contracts, task orders issued during the final ordering period may be awarded for a full twelve-month period of performance. This will mitigate the risk to USSOCOM from approximately one hundred task orders under the existing contract expiring on 30 April 2010 and an undetermined number of task orders under the new contracts beginning on 1 May 2010.
<p>The competitive acquisition for the follow-on to this contract is currently underway (refer to H92222-09-R-0034 Global Battlstaff and Program Support (GBPS)).</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, all responses received within forty-five days of the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

Describe the efforts that have been made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a Commerce Business Daily notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 (copy attached) and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies:This requirement is expected to exceed $25,000 and in accordance with FAR 5.201(b)(1) a notice will be posted through FBO.In accordance with FAR 6.302-5(a)2 authorized or required by statute, this procurement is uncer VA Healthcare Resources Sharing Authority Law Title 38 USC sections 8151-8153.7.	 Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:  The proposed price for an individual with this level of education, expertise, and related experience is fair and reasonable. *8.  Description of the market survey that was conducted (i.e. names of firms and the date(s) the firms were contacted) and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted:A review of other urology researchers in the areas has indicated there are no other sources available that possess the relevant knowledge and research experience of Dr. Lowalekar that can provide the required services. *9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as  an explanation as to why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statement of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for competition have not been developed or are not available.The Department of Urology is one of the only places in the country with expertise in studies of bladder and penile dysfunction. There are very few well-trained investigators in neurourology research and it would be virtually impossible to find experts in lower urinary tract dysfunction research and medicine within a single academic and administrative entity.  Dr. Lowalekars familiarity with our research areas along with his extensive experience in research techniques employed in our lab make him a unique candidate that could not be duplicated in any other existing department.  *10.  A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed an interest in the acquisition:None to datena*11.  A statement of the actions, if any, that the department/service may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies/services is required in the future:The department does not have barriers to competition. The research focus of the department is highly specific and few researchers have the expertise for this position. This contracting activity will continue to encourage full and open competition whenever possible.POC Robert OLearyContract specialistEmail Robert.oleary@va.gov774-826-3003Deadline Jan 14,2010  3:00PM EST

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), in cooperation with Guam Department of Agriculture (GDA), is conducting a program to eradicate the coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros, that dispersed from an exotic introduction in the Tumon Bay area of Guam. The coconut rhinoceros beetle is a serious exotic pest of palm trees and also attacks other hosts of agricultural and horticultural significance. The program is needed to eliminate the pest risk from the infested areas of Guam, where it has been detected, and to prevent the spread of coconut rhinoceros beetle to other areas of Guam and other parts of the United States.
<p><br />This will be a firm fixed price contract for a base period of 8 months and 4 possible option years. All pricing to include any and all costs but not limited to: overhead, general and administrative costs, profit, licensing/certification and transportation.</p>
<p>&bull; Contractor must be able to provide immediate fumigation services.</p>
<p>&bull; Must have sufficient methyl bromide fumigants available to complete a large scope of work such as this.</p>
<p>&bull; Must be ready to conduct fumigations of host materials immediately to prevent further infestations.</p>
<p>&bull; Must be prepared to perform services "on call" on an as needed basis throughout the proposed contract period per statement of work.</p>
<p>Evaluation-Commercial Items. <br />The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. <br />Options. - The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes based on estimated line items for base and option periods by adding the total price for all lines 001 - 005 for the total price. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>At this time; we are unable to determine the total amount of area that will require fumigation this fiscal year. We have an existing back log of up to 27,000 cubic feet that should have been fumigated months ago. With nine months remaining in the fiscal year the project could generate that much again. Actual fumigation volume can decrease by up to 50% due to reduction by chipping and other factors and increased due to required stand off space vs stack size. The rough estimation of area needed to be fumigated during the contract period is 33,333 cubic feet .</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 




Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>PERFORMANCE BASED WORK STATEMENT (PBWS)<br />FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE CAMPAIGN</p>
<p>1.0 PURPOSE: This performance based work statement describes the requirements to provide an internal area-wide customer service campaign for employee-patient relations and employee-employee relations for Oklahoma City Area Indian Health Service facilities. <br /><br />1.1 Background: The Indian Health Service (IHS) is an agency within the US Dept of Health and Human Services, and is responsible for providing federal health services to American Indians and Alaska Natives. The provision of health services to members of federally recognized tribes grew out of the special relationship between the federal government and Indian tribes. The IHS is the principal health care provider and health advocate for the Indian people. The IHS goal is to assure that accessible health care services are available to the American Indian and Alaska Natives. The IHS currently provides health services to approximately 1.5 million American Indians and Alaska Natives, who belong to 557 federally, recognized tribes in 34 states.</p>
<p>The Oklahoma City Area IHS administers health care to approximately 39 tribes with a direct site user population of approximately 170,000, through 12 health centers and hospital facilities, and outpatient/outreach programs. There is a need to design a comprehensive customer service campaign that will promote and identify opportunities for improved employee-patient relations and employee-employee relations.</p>
<p><br />1.2 Scope: The Contractor shall provide a comprehensive customer service campaign that promotes and identifies opportunities for improved customer service. The Oklahoma City Area IHS locations include: Claremore Indian Hospital, Clinton Indian Health Center, El Reno Indian Health Center, Watonga Indian Health Center, Haskell Indian Health Center, White Cloud Indian Health Center, Lawton Indian Hospital, Anadarko Indian Health Center, Carnegie Indian Health Center, Pawnee Indian Health Center, Pawhuska Indian Center, Wewoka Indian Health Center, and the Oklahoma City Area Office.<br /><br />Duties and Responsibilities: The Oklahoma City Area Indian Health Service is seeking a contractor to provide employee training that will raise the customer service behaviors of its employees to the highest standards. Critical to meeting this mission is that employees not only provide exemplary customer care but also contribute to a work environment that supports and encourages productive and positive teamwork.<br /><br />The Oklahoma City Area Indian Health Service employs approximately 1400 employees who provide services to American Indians from various tribes located within Oklahoma and Kansas. IHS employees come from diverse backgrounds and levels of education and provide all administrative and support services necessary to support an agency of this magnitude.<br /><br />Training services must be comprehensive and focused on indentifying and changing employee behaviors where necessary. Effectual behavioral change requires comprehensive training that not only raises awareness of customer services standards and practices but also engages employees in training activities that will establish sustaining performance.<br /><br />The Oklahoma City Area Indian Health Service is unique in that its clients consist mainly of American Indians living in the state of Oklahoma and a portion of Kansas. In addition, the employee base has many American Indians. The contractor should display any past performance of working with Indian Health Service and working with American Indians at the grass roots level or community level. The contractor should demonstrate its understanding of the cultural and community connections of service and how it is critical to successfully deliver effective training. All training modules and presentations must be culturally reflective to properly address American Indian cultural diversity and American Indian historic trauma, and display an understanding of the living conditions, quality of life, disparities and unique challenges faced by the Oklahoma City Area Indian Health Service' client base.<br /><br />The contractor will need to demonstrate a cost effective strategy that best utilizes a mix of available technologies and personal service to dynamically and interactively accomplish the training and strategic goals of the Oklahoma City Area Indian Health Service OCAIHS. A plan for marketing the training to Oklahoma City Area Indian Health Service must also be included. The duration of the contract will be one year and must provide opportunities for newly hired employees to go through the training. Four additional option years may be exercised at the option of the government.<br /><br />Strategic Goals: 1. Excellent Customer Service every day. 2. Design a comprehensive Customer Service campaign. 3. Promote and identify opportunities for improved customer service. 4. Identify all recourses needed. 5. Disseminate Customer service information using a variety of mediums. 6. Ensure that all communicated information is accessible to the intended audience. 7. Ensure that all communicated information is culturally appropriate and reflects Native American Tribes within the OCAIHS. 8. Develop a variety of innovative Customer Service strategies ( "toolbox") to address customer issues that will meet the needs of management/administration. 9. Increase employee understanding of Customer Service as an investment in the quality their carrer and work life experiences. 10. Incorporate customer service standards as a mandatory outcome in all performance standards to include customer service standards for all contracted employees. 11. Establish and promote a measurable Customer Service training. 12 Assurances all current OCAIHS employees will complete the training. 13. Develop an OCAIHS wide customer survey instrument that will analyze the results, identify target audience (management/administration/employees), be able to based on survey results, incorporate customer service improvements into the next years work plan.<br />and measure customer service satisfaction annually.<br />&nbsp;<br />Both oral and written presentations will be conducted at the Indian Health Service Oklahoma City Area Office, located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, approximately February 2, 2010. Proposals will demonstrate the successful offeror's ability to meet the duties and responsibilities described in the Performance Based Scope of Work.</p>
<p>During the oral and written presentations, the contractor should demonstrate its ability to provide a positive working environment providing training for Indian Health Service employees and projects involving cultural diversity training regarding Native American culture. Since multi-media will be important, a history of technology based training and education should be demonstrated.<br /><br />PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES: The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Special Communication Requirements (SCR) Division, Webster Field Annex intends to procure Rack Ready Vehicular Platforms  for multiple programs which the SCR Division supports.   The Government intends to award multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements in accordance with the attached statement of work and solicitation.

Performance will take place CONUS.  There is a partial set aside for small business (see solicitation for details).  

NOTE: BLOCK 9 OF RFP SAYS 3 FEBRUARY 2009.  IT SHOULD READ 3 FEBRUARY 2010.  ELSEWHERE IN THE RFP, THE 2010 IS USED.  PLEASE SUBMIT BY 3 FEBRUARY 2010. 

All interested contractors/vendors should complete the RFP including all certifications contained in its provisions, and provide a proposal in the format specified in Section L.  Proposals are due by 2:00 P.M. Eastern February 3, 2010.

To be eligible to receive an agreement with the Federal Government, interested parties must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) online at www.ccr.gov.

The government will not accept proposals submitted via e-mail.  The POC is Robert Battaglia, phone: 732-323-7535 or e-mail: robert.battaglia@navy.mil

Purpose of a BPA

It is the intent of the Contacting Office at Lakehurst NJ to award multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) to qualified responsible contractors/vendors providing a basis for the award of delivery orders for its SCR’s requirements.  It is important to understand what a BPA is and what it will accomplish.  It is an agreement in which a contractor has been determined able to provide a particular product or class of products.  Upon receipt of a BPA, terms and conditions have been agreed to in advance for any delivery orders between the contract agency and the contractor.  Each BPA has a maximum dollar value assigned that represents only the potential dollar value; it is not a promise of total dollars awarded to any particular vendor.  For the Rack Ready Platform, that maxium value is 10 million dollars.  In addition, if that dollar value is reached with any one contractor, the contracting agency reserves the right to issue an additional BPA with that contractor, as well as award additional BPAs to qualified contractors at any time.

This solicitation meets the Federal Acquisition Regulation requirements for Synopsis (FAR 5.207 -- Preparation and Transmittal of Synopses).  After the BPAs are awarded, Request for Proposals/Quotes (RFPs) will be sent electronically to the qualified contractors for competition on either a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable or Best Value Basis, that basis provided in each individual RFP.   An additional advertisement will not be published for Delivery Orders (FAR 5.202 (11):  The proposed contract action is made under the terms of an existing contract that was previously synopsized in sufficient detail to comply with the requirements of FAR 5.207 with respect to the current proposed contract action)

The required information for potential contractor proposals will demonstrate their ability to meet the requirements of the individual Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs).  It is possible that a contractor will only be determined qualified to provide certain CLINs as opposed to the entire BPA as advertised.  There are certain CLINs set aside for small businesses as well.

The Price information is not binding on the contractor; it simply provides a basis for estimating future procurements.  While providing price information is a requirement for the proposal, there is no evaluation as to price reasonableness conducted.  BPA’s are reviewed annually as well, and during those annual reviews, updated price sheets will be requested.  Price becomes a factor only when an RFP is released for a delivery order.  At that time, competition will determine price reasonableness unless best value requirements specify otherwise.

There is not an order attached to the basic BPA itself, but it qualifies the contractor to compete for delivery order awards issued to holders of the BPAs.  These competitions are conducted in a compressed timeframe due to the immediacy of the requirement.  The process for the placement of delivery orders is spelled out in Section H of the RFP for the BPA.  

If you produce the items described in the Statement of Work, you are encouraged to submit a proposal as described in Section L.

A Firm Fixed Price contract seems inappropriate for a Small Business, particularly when Task 1 involves Requirements Gathering to propose a &lt;software&gt; solution.&nbsp; Did DOL mean for the contract to be a Time and Materials contract with Firm Fixed Price Labor Rates?<br />A.&nbsp; This is designed as an FFP at our customer request. However, the question of consideration for a labor hour or time and material type contract for at least a partial amount of the requirement is with the customer for review.

<DESC><p>Synopsis for Project Number 101001: Simplified Acquisition of Base Engineering Requirements <br />(SABER)</p>
<p>Solicitation Number: FA8601-10-R-0010.<br /><br />The scope of this project consists of furnishing all materials, equipment, and personnel necessary to design, manage, and accomplish individual projects under the purview of Wright-Patterson AFB, OH. During the contract period, Base Civil Engineering will identify construction tasks and the Contracting Office will negotiate and issue individual delivery orders to the Contractor to complete them. Projects will be in support of real property maintenance, repair, alteration, and/or new construction. The work involved may include, but is not limited to minimal design (35%), carpentry, concrete, excavating, interior, electrical, steam fitting, plumbing, sheet metal, painting, demolition, masonry, and welding.</p>
<p>This requirement is restricted as a national 8(a) competitive set-aside pursuant to Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)(1).</p>
<p>The estimated contract value is $10M. The guaranteed contract minimum will be $25,000. Traditionally, there have been upwards of 100 active SABER delivery orders at varying stages of completion at any given time. However, this historical data does not necessarily reflect future SABER requirements. The NAICS Code is 236220. The size standard is $33.5M.</p>
<p>In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to award of solicitations issued after 31 May 1998. Registration may be accomplished at http://www.ccr.gov, or telephone at 1-888-CCR-2423. Every solicitation issued after 31 May 1998 must include the clause at DFARS 252.204-7004, "Required Central Contractor Registration.</p>
<p>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS: The Simplified Acquisition of Base Engineering Requirements (SABER) Contract, at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, will be a firm-fixed price indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type for estimating and construction efforts. The period of performance 365 days. This is a follow-on effort to the current contract, FA8601-07-D-0008. Required contractor expertise includes a Contract Manager, Environmental Manager, Design Manager, Quality Assurance Evaluator, and Project Manager. The Government anticipates significant subcontracting activity under the SABER contract and partnering is encouraged. Liquidated damages, if applicable, shall be specified in each delivery order.</p>
<p>NOTES:<br />(1) The solicitation, specifications, and drawings will be available on the website on or about 19 Jan 10, at the FedBizOpps website.<br />(2) Hard copies of the solicitation will NOT be provided. However, you may download and print the file from the website.<br />(3) There is no fee for this solicitation.<br />(4) A copy of the solicitation will be available for review at Dayton Builders Exchange, Minority Contractor Business Assistance Program, and F.W. Dodge Division in Dayton, OH.<br />(5) A registration page will be attached to the website. You are not required to register. However, when you register you will receive notice of any amendments and/or addendums that may be issued to the solicitation. If you have not registered, it will be your responsibility to check the website for any changes to the solicitation.<br />(6) Contractors shall be capable of securing bonding in the amount of $2M for the bid bond. When the contract is awarded, the contractor shall be responsible for securing performance and payment bonds in the amount of 100% of the cumulative dollar value of all active delivery orders. Prime Contractors shall be capable of securing bonding in the amount of at least $2,000,000 and potentially as much as $5,000,000.<br />The amount may be more or less than this range depending on the delivery order activity.<br />(7) You shall provide a signed copy of the SF 1442 by the proposal closing date specified in the solicitation. There will not be a public bid opening.</p>

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The United States Air Force (USAF) is seeking interested sources regarding fielding additional tactical aerial targeting pods/Advanced Targeting Pod Sensors Enhancement (ATP-SE).  The sponsoring activity is Aeronautical Systems Center, 647th Aeronautical System Squadron, Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, OH.  The ! program office anticipates awarding, on or about 28 FEB 2010, a competitive Firm Fix Priced (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract of five years in length for the production ATP-SE systems.  Total requirement are for an estimated 670 systems, of which approximately 275 new systems are anticipated to be procured via this activity.  The actual quantity will be dependent on requirements, price and available funding.  The ability to handle classified material will be a requirement for award of any contract(s) that may result from this notification.  The purpose of this notification is to determine whether any competitive sources exist and to notify industry of any impending actions so that possible subcontracting opportunities may be pursued.  Any IDIQ Contract resulting from this sources sought synopsis will be to acquire the non-developmental ATP-SE as a follow-on system to the AN/AAQ-33 targeting pod.  The ATP-SE is an external, pylon-mounted targeting pod and will be integrated onto the F-16, F-15, A-10, B-52 and B-1 platforms with the potential for integration onto other military platforms.  The targeting pod is capable of producing infrared and visible imagery of both ground and airborne targets.  The pod provides laser ranging and designation in support of weapon delivery, navigational functions, recording and data-linking of generated imagery and data.  The imagery will allow for greater stand-off ranges and increase target identification.  The Government does not contemplate providing any data or drawings related to the existing targeting pods already in the Government's inventory.  This contract may include activities for both existing and new targeting pods such as providing support equipment, spares an! d product support to include but not limited to: field and depot level support, sustaining engineering, software support and integration, technical data, aircrew and maintenance training, initial spares, provisioning, flight test support, Contractor Logistical Support (CLS), special studies, efforts in support of contingency operations and contractor field team support to include emergency fleet repair support, as well as integration, test, and production and installation of future modifications and enhancements as new technologies become available.   Interested companies must submit a Statement of Capabilities not to exceed 10 pages addressing the following areas: 1. Capability to meet all technical requirements 2. Capability to provide Contractor Logistical Support (CLS) 3. Ability to demonstrate systems integration across the aircraft fleet 4. Capability to produce technically competent analyses on the multiple areas covered in the above paragraph 5. Description of previous or current experience in precision targeting systems 6. Show ability to start delivery on or about 14 months ARO.  The ASC/647th AESS/TZ Program Office intends to host an industry day at Wright Patterson Air Force Base at a date to be determined to discuss the capability requirements for the ATP-SE in greater detail.  This industry day will include an unclassified open session and closed one-on-one sessions to discuss classified requirements.  The closed sessions are reserved for prime contractors only (prime contractors will be allowed to bring team members of their choosing) with the ability to handle classified material whose clearances are verified by the 77th Aeronautical System Wing Security Office.   Further notification and information regarding this industry day will be posted in the near future.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION. This is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources, and will be used to determine the basis for any competitive aspects of the acquisition. Accordingly, each respondent is requested to clarify whether any teaming arrangements are contemplated (including Small and Small Disadvantaged Business participation). Based upon receipt of responses and analysis, a determination will be made to ascertain the Government position of other than full and open versus a competitive solicitation. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their size, particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business concern, a minority institution, and should also indicate if the firm is foreign-owned. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334511 "Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aer! onautical, and Nautical System and Instrument manufacturing" applies to this acquisition with a size standard of 750 employees.

Update: ASC 647 AESS ATP-SE IDIQ TASK ORDER CONTRACT DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this update is to reiterate to industry that information about the pending source selection, requirements for ATP-SE, or any other discussions pertaining to the ATP-SE that may occur with industry shall not be considered a requirement or direction unless that information has originated from the PCO, Mr. Robert Hixenbaugh. The ATP-SE team has been made aware of communication between the user and a contractor that may have related perceived requirements specifically "non-developmental ATP-SE system procured as a result of this sources sought synopsis will require a single OFP" This is not a currently planned requirement.  All future requirements for ATP-SE will be released to all potential Offerors through the PCO. If any Offeror believes they have received direction or guidance on the upcoming program it is incumbent upon them to disregard that information/not act upon that information if it has not come from the PCO. This announcement does not relieve the potential offerors from the previous request for submitting the capabilities statements on or before the 16 May deadline.This is not a request for proposal and no response is required.    The PCO shall be the sole POC for any and all communication regarding this acquisition: Kimberly Henderson, (937) 255-7682, email kimberly.henderson@wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC>An SMC A-AS Industry Day is scheduled 19 January 2010, 2:00pm PST, at the Gordon Conference Center, Room&nbsp;1, 483 N Aviation Blvd, Building 270 (1st Floor), Los Angeles AFB CA 90245-2808. Due to limited accommodations, interested primes are requested to limit company participation to 2 members maximum. Current and potential team members are requested to limit company participation to 1 member. Each attendee must register NLT 4:00 PM PST, 15 January 2010 at the following website:<br /><br /><a href="https://einvitations.afit.edu/SMCPI/anim.cfm">https://einvitations.afit.edu/SMCPI/anim.cfm</a>. <br /><br />Each interested prime and team member (current or potential) is requested to provide one completed questionnaire (enclosed) by the end of the forum.&nbsp; At the soonest available opportunity a draft performance work statement (PWS) will be provided under an FBO update or handed out at the forum at the latest.<br /><br />
<p>Background. The Space and Missile Systems Center, Los Angeles Air Force Base, CA is in the midst of planning a follow-on acquisition to replace the SMC Financial Support (SFS) and SMC Acquisition Support (SAS) programs for Advisory &amp; Assisted Services (A-AS). The SFS program provides financial, cost management, schedule management, and related training A-AS support to SMC organizations. The SAS program provides manpower, personnel, administration, configuration/data management, acquisition planning, contracting and associated training A-AS support. Both programs awarded task orders under FAR 8 Fair Opportunity business rules via SMC Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) based upon GSA Professional Engineering Services (PES), Schedule 871, contracts. This work was set-aside for small business BPA holders with less than 1,000 employees consistent with NAICS code 541710 (circa 2002). Both programs are expected to complete by mid calendar year 2011.</p>
<p>Follow-On. SMC anticipates a single follow-on acquisition reserved for small business that integrates the functionalities of SFS and SAS. The SMC A-AS Industry Day is intended to augment market research activities to form the basis for the acquisition strategy. To the maximum extent possible, contract type is anticipated as Firm-Fixed Price. It is unknown if SMC will continue its FAR 8 BPA GSA schedule implementation or establish FAR 15 IDIQ or other type contracts. Consistent with past practices, the Government is discerning the use of NAICS code 541712 (associated with GSA PES). However, NAICS code 541611 (associated with GSA MOBIS) is being investigated as an alternative under a BPA strategy. The follow-on acquisition is expected to be ready for the commencement of work by July 2011.</p>
<p>C2C. Coupled to this acquisition, it is anticipated that SMC Contractor to Civilian Conversion (C2C) activities will directly impact effort on this program. The goal of C2C is to convert contracted A-AS support to Government civilian staffing. The SMC C2C plan is currently at the pre-decisional stage. Its completion, implementation, magnitude, and phasing are TBD.</p>

<DESC>Amendment 01:&nbsp; This Amendment revises the "Collaborative Efforts" language<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"></span> highlighted in yellow in the attached full revised DARPA-BAA-10-12 document.<br /><br /><br />Original Synopsis Below.<br /><br />DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of grating-based integrated circuit layout design and patterning. The goal of the Gratings of Regular Arrays and Trim Exposures (GRATE) program is to develop revolutionary new circuit design methodologies combined with grating-based lithography tools to enable cost effective low volume nanofabrication for Department of Defense (DoD) applications. The novel circuit design methodologies will enable simplified physical layout implementation of circuits by leveraging extremely regular geometries. Overall circuit densities and performance will not be sacrificed when utilizing these new design approaches. These simplified circuit design geometries will be implemented using ultra-high-resolution grating patterns which can be fabricated at high throughput using either mask-based or maskless (interference) lithography. Cost effective low volume microfabrication will be achieved by lowering the design and fabrication costs of custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), enabling maskless interference-based patterning with practical throughputs, and improving fabrication yield resulting from regular circuit patterns.  See the full DARPA-BAA-10-12 document attached.

<DESC><strong>DRAFT SOLICITATION QUESTIONS and ANSWERS</strong>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 1:</strong> Reference Section L.4.3. There is a reference to a form called Attachment L1. This attachment is not included as part of the draft. L-1 is critical to offerors ability to begin the development of our Past Performance section and having the template in advance of the final RFP will allow offerors to take advantage of the time between the draft RFP and final proposal submission to build our Past Performance responses using the Government directed format. Has this document been developed by the Government? If so we would request that the Government release it as soon as possible. <br /><br /><em>Government Response:</em> The Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) Attachment L-1 is currently being tailored for this solicitation and will be made available on FedBizOps for all interested offerors as soon as it becomes available.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Question/Comment 2:</strong> Are second-tier subcontractors permitted, and, if so, how will the size status of said 2nd-tier subcontractors affect the attainment of socioeconomic subcontracting goals?<br /><br /><em>Government Response:</em> Second-tier subcontractors are certainly permitted on DTRA contracting opportunities, but for the purpose of the subject solicitation they will not count toward a prime offeror's subcontracting/socio-economic goal. Offerors must note that the stated DTRA subcontracting/socio-economic goals are tied to the prime offeror through its first-tier subcontractors.<br /><br /><strong>Question/Comment 3:</strong> Reference L.3.3.3.1. requires that &lsquo;all personnel be identified by labor category, a description of the position, skill level associated with the position,' etc. Even using the smallest allowable font, a table providing this information would be extremely lengthy and would take away needed space from the explanation of the technical approach. We recommend that the personnel response required by L.3.3.3.1 be outside the page limits for Volume II.<br /><em>Government Response:</em> The Government will allow unlimited pages for the labor chart required under Section L.3.3.3.1. The final RFP will update Section L.1.2 with the revised page limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 4:</strong> Reference M.2.3. Evaluation subfactors to Factor 1 are referred to as subfactors A-E and subfactors 1-5. To provide clarity in the required cross-reference matrix that the Offeror provides with the proposal, could the Government define which notation they prefer?<br /><em>Government Response:</em> The Government will revise the subfactors for Factor 1 to reflect subfactors A-E. This revision will be included in the final RFP.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 5:</strong> Reference SOO 2.1, 2.2, 2.3; L.1.2, (Table 1-2); L.3.3.3.1 (first sentence). Section L asks that the offeror 'express its technical understanding and approaches to performing all technical objectives as delineated in the SOO.' The SOO is a comprehensive document that delineates 31 tasks, many of which require a detailed explanation. Section L also defines additional information requirements to be included in the proposal. For the offeror to provide the government with a description of its capabilities detailed enough to facilitate a thorough evaluation, we recommend that the page limit for the Technical Approach section of the Mission Capability volume be increased.<br /><em>Government Response:</em> The Government will allow a total of 20 pages for technical approach. This change will be reflected in Section L.1.2 in the final RFP.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 6:</strong> Reference M.2.4.1, L.3.3.2.1. M.2.4.1, last paragraph, states that the commitment to socio-economic goals will be evaluated as part of the Mission Capability volume. However, the corresponding instruction at L.3.3.2.1 does not require this subject be addressed there. Instead, socio-economic goals are covered in Volume I (L.2.12), and offeror's response in that volume may not be seen by the evaluators of Volume II. We suggest that offeror's socio-economic goals be evaluated as part of the evaluation of Volume I. Alternatively, to save space in a severely page limited proposal, would the Government permit a brief cross-reference from the offeror's response to Volume II, directing the evaluator to Volume I?<br /><em>Government Response:</em> Yes, Offerors may cross-reference Volume I as part of their Volume II socio-economic response. See L.1.3.10 that explains cross-references.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 7:</strong> Reference L.2.7. To allow sufficient time for review and comment, we request that the proposed DD 254 be released in advance of the final RFP.<br /><em>Government Response:</em> The Government will post the DD254 as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 8:</strong> Reference L.1.2 (Table 1-2). To allow Offerors to provide present and past performance information sufficient to support a thorough evaluation, we request that the pages allowed for each reference be increased.<br /><em>Government Response:</em> The Government will allow 4 pages per reference for Attachment L-1, as defined in Section L.4.3 and the table in L.1.2. The final RFP will be revised to reflect the changes to page allowance.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 9:</strong> Reference SOO 2.3.6. SOO paragraph 2.3.6 describes specific capabilities required in the biological threat reduction program area. Specifically the requirement statement reads "Provide the capability to support the areas of ...veterinary and public health system design and associated fields of study."<br />Should the phrase 'associated fields of study' be interpreted to imply that capabilities are limited only to veterinary and public health systems? <br /><em>Government Response:</em> The SOO paragraph 2.3.6 has been updated and revised to state: <br />"Provide the capability to support the areas of disease surveillance, detection and diagnostics; laboratory operations; biological safety and security, infectious disease medicine, epidemiology, research development and oversight, to include human and veterinary user requirements; associated fields of study for veterinary and public health system designs, which would be beneficial to the Biological Threat Reduction Program."</p>
<p><br /><strong>Question/Comment 10:</strong> Reference L.2.13. Paragraph b requires a statement in Volume I concerning OCI. Further, Section L.3.3.2.1 Management Plan also requires an OCI mitigation statement in Volume II. How do these requirements differ?<br /><em>Government Response:</em> The OCI requirement in L.3.3.2.1 will be deleted. The Final RFP will reflect the change.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 11:</strong> Reference L.3.3.5. Can the government provide relative time frames for the scenario to aid offerors in pricing the scenario?<br /><em>Government Response:</em> The Sample Scenario will not be priced.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 12:</strong> Reference M.2.4.1. One of the elements required to satisfy this factor is a OCI Mitigation Plan, vice statement as referred to in Sections L.2.13 and L.3.3.2.1. Is the use of the terminology Plan and Statement the same? If not, can the Government provide guidance on what is expected in the OCI Plan?<br /><em>Government Response:</em> Please note that the Government will revise the OCI provision in the final RFP. Solicitation provisions L.3.3.2.1 and M.2.4.1 will be deleted. The remaining OCI provision, L.2.13, will require an offeror's statement as to whether an OCI (as defined in section FAR 9.5 "Organization and Consultant Conflicts of Interest") exists and whether a mitigation plan may be required. The offeror may elect to submit a mitigation plan with their proposal (offer) but, if there is an OCI, the Contracting Officer will require a mitigation plan prior to contract award.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 13:</strong> Reference M.1.1 and M.2.2.1. Section M.1.1 states that Mission Capability has four (4) subfactors. Section M.2.2.1 shows five (5) subfactors listed under the Mission Capability factor. Are offerors correct in assuming that there are five (5) Mission Capability subfactors?<br /><em>Government Response:</em> Section M.1.1 will be revised to reflect 5 subfactors.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 14:</strong> Reference H, 52-234-4 Earned Value Management System (Jul 2009). Does DTRA intend to require the monthly submittal of full Contract Performance Reports as generated from a validated Earned Value Management System (EVMS)? Although the intended contract type is cost-reimbursable, the nature of the work appears to be overwhelmingly of the Level of Effort (LOE) type. The application of EVM on work that is LOE in nature typically is impractical and inefficient. If DTRA intends to tailor the EVMS requirement, what is the anticipated extent of the tailoring? <br /><em>Government Response:</em> The EVMS requirement will be completely removed from the solicitation.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 15:</strong> Reference L.2.13, L.3.3.2.1 (last bullet). The last paragraph in L.3.3.2.1 of the draft RFP implies that should a real or perceived OCI be identified and disclosed the Government may consider mitigation strategies to permit a contractor or subcontractor to continue the delivery of service provided the mitigation strategies are determined by the Contracting Officer to be adequate for the circumstance. Does this also apply to contractors and subcontractors providing services under the CTRIC and BTRIC contract vehicles? <br /><em>Government Response:</em> See RFP clause H.6.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 16:</strong> Reference Section H.6. In reference to paragraph H.6 which states "the Contractor and its subcontractors are precluded from participating directly or indirectly as contractors or subcontractors on any other contracts which provide support to Cooperative Threat Reduction Directorate of DTRA..." <br />Is it correct to assume directly or indirectly means as a prime contractor or subcontractor at any tier and/or to perform as a contractor or subcontractor whereby the procuring agency is other than the CTR Directorate but the CTR Directorate is the end user or a 3rd party benefiting organization?<br /><em>Government Response:</em> The intent of this clause is to limit the A&amp;AS contractor from performing as a contractor of other procurements where CTR is the requiring activity (i.e. the organization generating the requirement or the "end user") The clause will be amended to read as follows: "The contractor and its subcontractors are precluded from participating, directly or indirectly, as a contractor or subcontractor on any other contracts where the Cooperative Threat Reduction Directorate of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency is the requiring activity during the period of the A&amp;AS contract or, in case of subcontractors, during the period they are subcontracted to this A&amp;AS effort."</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 17:</strong> In some instances, Offerors may wish to submit Past Performance references for work they have been performing as a subcontractor. In some of these instances the Prime contractor may now be a competitor for this CTR A&amp;AS solicitation. In order to avoid potential conflicts (such as bias) when submitting past performance references for subcontracted work, we assume the Government will allow Offerors to send their Past Performance Questionnaires directly to their Government points of contract instead of vetting them through the prime contractor. Is this assumption acceptable to the Government?<br /><em>Government Response:</em> The subcontractors will send their PPQs directly to the Government POCs (end users), and not to the prime contractor.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 18:</strong> Reference M2.4.2, Sub factor 2 Technical Approach (bullet 1 and 3) asks for offeror's to demonstrate an approach and process to assign personnel based on labor categories, skill level and qualifications to fulfill the requirements of the SOO. Bullet 2 references a comprehensive plan, it is our assumption that bullets 1 and 3 cover the comprehensive plan. Is our assumption correct or is there additional information that the Government is looking for in this section? <br />If our assumption is correct we would recommend that bullet 2 be deleted as it is redundant. If our assumption is incorrect we request that the Government provide additional guidance/clarification on what additional information you want to have included as part of the comprehensive plan.<br /><em>Government Response:</em> The Government will delete bullet 2 for consistency and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 19:</strong> L.3.3.3.1 asks that all personnel be identified by labor category, a description of the position and skill level associated with the position. Since this table will take up a considerable amount of space we recommend that it be excluded from the 15 page limit. By excluding the table from the page count it will allow offerors to provide more detailed technical responses.<br /><em>Government Response:</em> See response to Question 3 (labor chart is now unlimited pages)</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 20:</strong> Reference L.2.13. Pre-award Organization Conflicts of Interest is called out in Volume I. L.3.3.2.1. bullet 8 calls for an OCI mitigation statement. Recommend that L.3.3.2.1 bullet 8 be moved into Volume I to minimize cross referencing between the volumes. <br /><em>Government Response:</em> See Question 12 response.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 21:</strong> "The government has requested the contractor "provide a document management system and library to support the storage and retrieval of electronic and paper CTR documentation compliant with DoD Records Management procedures..." Does the Government expect that the tool used to support electronic records management is on the JITC PRODUCT REGISTER for DoD 5015.02-STD Records Management Compliance or is the existing Docushare system and paper records management procedures sufficient to meet the records management compliance requirement stated in 2.3.23?<br /><em>Government Response:</em> The Government does not prescribe that the systems currently used for this purpose be maintained/continued by the successful Offeror. The Government requires expertise to: analyze current CT processes and procedures, determine if the current records management software system is optimal, make recommendations regarding potential courses of action to achieve compliance with relevant requirements, support execution of Government approved courses of action, and oversee future compliance. The government has no comment on whether a suitable records management system is on the JITC Product Register. The government will consider the recommendations provided by the contractor.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 22:</strong> Reference SOO. What is the current level of A&amp;AS effort supporting the CTR? Please provide a list of current A&amp;AS contractor positions filled and unfilled with the following information: the mission area they support; the labor category; whether a security clearance/US citizenship is held or required; the place of their work assignment (on-site, off-site, at another Government agency, overseas at what site); specific language skill required; and current labor rate.<br /><em>Government Response: <br /></em>A response is being generated and will likely be posted by COB 08 Jan 2010.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 23:</strong> Reference SOO L.3.3.2.1. Program Assistant is a generic but unclear description of a key staff position. Please clarify the role envisioned that a Program Assistant would perform<br /><em>Government Response:</em> <br />There is no SOO reference L.3.3.2.1. <br />Section L.3.3.2.1 of the draft RFP refers to a lead Program Assistant. The government has determined that this is not considered a key staff position, and will be eliminated from the language of the final RFP. However, the current Program Assistant position traditionally has the responsibility for administrative functions performed on-site at DTRA headquarters. These activities include: cable coordination, correspondence assistance, providing quality control of products, travel coordination, task tracking, file management, translation coordination, report coordination, and schedule functions.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 24:</strong> Reference SOO Paragraph 2.3.28. We assume the level of classification for discussions, meetings and materials handling at the contractor provided facility is Secret. Please confirm.<br /><em>Government Response:</em> That information will be provided on the DD254.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 25:</strong> Reference SOO Paragraph 2.1.12. CTR interacts with many US Government or non-government agencies in the accomplishment of its mission. Please provide a list of applicable MOUs or MOAs with those agencies.<br /><em>Government Response:</em> CTR has no MOUs or MOAs in place pertaining to its provision of contractor support personnel to organizations outside of CTR.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 26:</strong> Reference SOO Paragraph 2.3.31. requires ". . . an orderly, complete transition from the incumbent A&amp;AS contractor, including preservation of and uninterrupted access to all program information stored and maintained in the incumbent's information/document management system." Will the Government provide details of the incumbents existing information/document management system? Can we assume that DTRA will provide "the incumbent's information/document management system" to the new contractor (or is it the intention to have the selected contractor implement a new management system?)?<br /><em>Government Response:</em> The current information/document management system is a Commercial, Off-the-Shelf System, which will be provided to the successful Offeror upon contract award. However, the successful offeror is not obligated to use this software; recommendations to update the CTR IT support infrastructure will be considered.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 27:</strong> Reference Section L. What is the difference between the "Technical Approach" (Section L.1.2) and the "Technical Plan" (L.3.3.3.1)? There are no other sub-sections called out in the L.3.3.3.1 Technical Approach, and the page limit does not support adequate discussion. We assume Technical Approach and Technical Plan are synonymous in this usage. Please confirm.<br /><em>Government Response:</em> There is no difference. The single Subsections of Management Approach and Technical Approach will be removed to reduce confusion. The final RFP will reflect this change.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 28:</strong> Reference Section L.4.3. Do Forms L-1 count against the two-page past performance limit? What is the page limit for Forms L-1?<br /><em>Government Response:</em> See response to Question 8.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 29:</strong> Reference Section L.3.3.2.1 Management Plan. Within the statement in the second paragraph "senior technical experts for all areas shall be identified," The term "all areas" is ambiguous but we presume it to be "each of the CT program areas". Can you provide clarification?<br /><em>Government Response:</em> Depending on the approach taken by the Offeror, all areas could span CT, or could be specific to the divisions of CT. An example could be a technical expert in Systems Engineering, who could oversee all aspects of their expertise throughout CT, whereas an expert in veterinary medicine would likely be specific to the BTRP program area.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 30:</strong> Reference Section L.3.3.4 Transition Plan. : A transition requires the participation of the outgoing incumbent. Please provide a copy of the incumbent's transition out plan or, if a specific transition out plan does not exist, a statement of transition out activities that the incumbent is contractually obligated to support. <br /><em>Government Response:</em> The incumbent's "transition out plan" was placed on FedBizOps October 8, 2009, and will be transitioned to the final Solicitation announcement.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 31:</strong> Reference Section L.5.1. Please clarify if information other than cost or pricing data is required. The first two sentences in the last paragraph of L.5.1 are confusing as to what is required now versus potentially some time in the future<br /><em>Government Response:</em> Per the last paragraph in section L.5.1 the offeror is required to provide "information other than cost and pricing data" in response to the Final RFP. The paragraph goes on to state that if, after proposals have been received, the Contracting Officer determines that adequate price competition did not occur and other exceptions do not exist (See FAR 15.403-1 (b)), the offeror may need to provide current, complete, and accurate cost or pricing data. However, until notified by the Contracting Officer, offerors should anticipate providing "information other than cost and pricing data" in their response to the RFP.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 32</strong>: Reference Section M Paragraph M.1.1, Basis for Contract Award. The first sentence cites the number of sub-factors for Mission Capability as "four (4)." Elsewhere it is cited as five (5) sub-factors, and five are listed in M.2.2.1. Please confirm the intent is to evaluate the five (5) Mission Capability factors in M.2.2.1.<br /><em>Government Response:</em> See response to Question 13</p>

<DESC>AMENDED TO UPDATE EXPECTED RFP ISSUANCE DATE TO ON OR ABOUT JANUARY 25, 2010.<br /><br />RELEASE A DRAFT SOLICITATION FOR INDUSTRY COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS, PROVIDE TO <a href="mailto:TRAVIS.GRAHAM@DHS.GOV">TRAVIS.GRAHAM@DHS.GOV</a> ON OR BEFORE JANUARY 14, 2010 BY 12PM EASTERN TIME.<br /><br /><br />The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Federal Protective Service (FPS) is responsible for providing security and law enforcement services for federal facilities. <br />The ICE Office of Acquisition (OAQ) plans to offer a requirement for a Computer Aided Dispatch Information System (CADIS) in support of the FPS Law Enforcement Mission.<br />To eliminate current functionality gaps and to address new law enforcement requirements a new system is needed that will automate core FPS law enforcement business processes and will result in a more standardized, integrated, and efficient national information technology solution for FPS. The system must provide a level of scalability and compatibility with other DHS, ICE, and FPS systems and shall always be in compliance with emerging DHS enterprise architecture. Further, the system must reflect the seamless integration of the following three functional components. <br />1) Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) System for personnel dispatching in response to incidents.<br />2) Record Management System (RMS) to collect, share, and report incident information based on National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) standards. A system to conduct efficient call center management, which includes automated data collection, calls routing, viewing call history, etc.<br />3) Geographic Information System (GIS) to provide location information to assess dangerous sites, improving routing, vehicle tracking and to display other relevant neighborhood information.
<p>Furthermore, the proposed CADIS must replace the current Daily Operations Log (DOL) and Web Records Management System (WebRMS). <br />CADIS shall have the capability to collect, modify, store, retrieve, and process record management and geographic information data via a report management function and a record management system. CADIS will improve FPS Officer Safety, as the current manual processes will be automated; reducing the chances of critical errors by removing the extensive liability that currently exists with the dispatchers. Additionally, CADIS will provide intelligent resources in reporting information that is needed to make knowledgeable business decisions and aid in criminal analysis, helping FPS' efforts in providing preventative security measures. <br />Specifically, the system shall:<br />&bull; Be fully National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) compliant<br />&bull; Implement a system availability of 99.999 percent when measured on a 24-hour per day, seven day a week basis for 365 days. Processor, disk storage, and power supply redundancy may be required in order to achieve the desired availability and protection of information. The system shall be configured such that operating a training component and/or running reports will not affect system response time.<br />&bull; Interface with external applications and data sources.<br />&bull; Have the ability to push the client application via the DHS network to desktops and Mobile Computing Devices (MCD) via the internal network.<br />&bull; Allow a user the ability to access the application, download appropriate information and forms relating to incidents, and submit the necessary information without re-keying information. <br />&bull; Allow the capability to be directly expandable by adding hardware and Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) modules. <br />&bull; Include a feature for backup, archival and recovery capability without taking CADIS out of service and with minimal impact on dispatch operations. <br />&bull; Provide the capability for users to work offline in the event of connectivity failures, and the capability to continue to work off-line in the event the failure occurs in the middle of a session without any data loss, and to upload saved offline data when connectivity is re-established.<br />&bull; Contain data exporting capabilities. CADIS must have the capability to export data in industry standard database formats to facilitate providing data to other databases controlled by DHS and/or other government entities. <br />&bull; Be able to generate standard automated forms and templates to be used by all regions; such as incident report, spot report, etc.<br />&bull; Contain a wide variety of reports and statistical information for analysis and management reporting and/or reporting requirements in real time. <br />&bull; Allow ad-hoc, dynamically generated reports such that code modifications are not required for each new report.</p>
<p>It is the intent of FPS to adapt to the current industry best practices as it relates to the FPS operating procedures and the operating environment of CADIS. Implementing CADIS will enable key FPS stakeholders the opportunity to assess current operating procedures against any productivity gains that can be realized through the introduction of automation. Consequently, neither a blanket "technology driving the process," nor a "process driving the technology" approach will be embraced, but a balanced approach that seriously evaluates the cost/benefit trade-off in moving from current to new operating procedures.</p>
<p>A full and open competition is anticipated with a request for proposals expected to be issued on or about&nbsp;January 6, 2010&nbsp;with proposals due approximately 30 days later.</p>

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334513   AMENDMENT I to RFQ-OH-10-00037 (originally posted 12/30/2009)
This amendment responds to questions under this RFQ.  All questions received and corresponding answers can be found below.  PLEASE NOTE:  No further technical questions will be accepted as of the date of issuance for this amendment. ALSO, please acknowledge receipt of this amendment 1 in your submitted quote. If you've already submitted a quote, you are not required to resubmit another quote, although you may if you choose to do so; regardless, you must acknowledge receipt of this amendment.  Finally, the due date for submission of quotes and all other terms not addressed in this amendment remain unchanged.

Question 1:
In Attachment A there is no mention of the sample delivery system. For this type of instrument to function correctly and in accordance with your requirements, the gas sample must be delivered at a temperature above the dewpoints of the gases of interest, filtered for particulates, and at a certain pressure and flow rate.
I am assuming (but would like to confirm) that there is an existing sample system delivering a sample; can you please describe this? If there is no such system in place, we can supply a sample pump, filters and heated lines.  Please comment.
Answer 1 - The probes, filters, and heated sample lines are provided by EPA. All pumps, regulators, etc., related to "pressure and flow rate" requirements are to be included in the quote.
Questions 2:
The instruments are rack mount types-is there an existing rack into which the instruments will be mounted? We can supply a wall mount package if required.
Please provide details of how the instruments will be mounted (do you need us to supply rails for rack mounting?)?
Answer  2 - EPA will be solely responsible for mounting the analyzers. Vendors may quote either rack-mount or bench-top units.
Question 3: 
What are the ambient conditions where the instruments will be used?
Answer 3 - The units will always be used indoors under controlled-humidity conditions. Ambient temperatures, however, may range from 50?F to 100?F, depending on heating and cooling loads (i.e., some research spaces have un-insulated overhead doors; these and other spaces may also have furnaces and other equipment adding heat to the space).



Question 4:
Please clarify the specification:  THC measurements are to use FID but then also requesting Chromatographic methane/NMHC measurements.
Answer 4 - Yes we do specifically need chromatographic methane/NMHC measurements.
Question 5:  
Our analyzer uses heated internal components but not an oven.  What is the dew point of the sample from your combustion process.
Answer 5 - EPA requires an oven-heated analyzer. Our maximum water dew point will be on the order of 128?F, but the dew point of condensable organics will be much higher.
Question 6:  
Does the RFQ include heated probes and sample lines?
Answer 6 - Heated probes and sample lines are not being included in this RFQ
Question 7:  
What is the distance from sample source to the analyzer? Answer 7 - Distance between the probe and analyzer will vary between ~80 feet and ~30 feet, but the resulting response delays need not be included in reporting analyzer response times.

GSA will be using funds from the FY 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for this project. This project intends to address the requirements to create a high performing energy efficient facility. The intent is to renovate an existing deteriorating federal facility in the building inventory and in doing so modernize the facility into an economically and operationally efficient High-Performance Green Building (HPGB) that is a highly leasable office facility that agencies will be excited to occupy, and do this following principles of Design Excellence and Sustainable Design. Interested parties are encouraged to register through FBO using the "Add Me to the Interested Vendors" link on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. Vendors are also encouraged to register to receive notices about this announcement by using the "Watch This Opportunity" link on the FBO website. NOTE: GSA PBS Region 10 will NOT be maintaining a manual list of interested vendors.
<p>PROJECT BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION: The project is modernization project in which the Design-Build (D/B) Contractor and its Team shall design and construct renovations and improvements to modernize the existing Jackson Federal Building into an economically and operationally efficient high-performance green building. This modernization project will include replacement and upgrades to building systems (electrical, HVAC, windows, and lighting). LEED-EB Gold certification will be pursued by the D/B Team, with LEED-EB Silver being an alternate certification level if LEED-EB Gold cannot be reached. The specific activities, tasks, and deliverables required of the D/B Team will be further delineated in the Statement of Work during Phase Two of this two-phase D/B solicitation.</p>
<p>The Design Build project shall include the performance of architectural/engineering services based on an approved concept selected during the Request for Proposal (RFP) stage of the acquisition process. The design will be in accordance with GSA quality standards. As required by the ARRA legislation, the facility will be designed to be a high performing green building (HPGB) and as such will meet the most current federal energy goals.</p>
<p>PROJECT SCOPE: This project includes the modernization of the building through a strategy of structure and materials reuse to the greatest practicable extent, introduction of modern building systems and use of innovative technologies to meet HPGB strategies. The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional architectural, engineering, interior design, HPGB consulting service, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, metric and English construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, schedules, space planning, value engineering services, LEED-AP services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD). The project shall comply with GSA design standards.</p>
<p>PROJECT MAGNITUDE: The maximum Estimated Cost of Construction is between $30,000,000.00 and $50,000,000.00.</p>
<p>PROJECT DURATION: 30 - 36 months (Design and Construction)</p>
<p>MARKET RESEARCH: A survey was conducted with industry to assist in the development of the Acquisition Plan for this project. Following are the results:<br /><br />Delivery Method: Design Build is the most appropriate acquisition approach<br />Contract Type: Preference for Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) vs Firm Fixed Price because it is more representative of a collaborative delivery effort.<br />Design Competition: Recommendation to limit the design competition (Phase 2) to no more than 5 offerors. <br />Stipend: A stipend would help defray costs to participate in the Design Competition.<br />Award Fee: Preference for good partnering<br /><br />COMPETITION: Unrestricted<br />This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, will be required to submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT STRATGY: The Design Build contractor will be selected using the Best Value Source Selection process pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures and FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ)) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will then be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. The short list will not be published in FedBizOpps. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal.</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include Phase Two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions.</p>
<p>CONTRACT AWARD: GSA PBS R10 contemplates awarding a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) type contract provided all waivers, deviations, and approvals are authorized prior to issuance of the Phase Two solicitation. Failure to obtain the necessary GMP type contract approvals will result in solicitation for and awarding a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The Phase Two RFP will identify which pricing methodology will be awarded, and will contain special provisions and clauses as necessary.</p>
<p>SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE: The RFQ will be issued electronically on or about 09/21/2009 on the internet at: http://www.fbo.gov/.<br />CLOSING DATE: The closing date for receipt of Phase I submittals shall be specified in the RFQ but is estimated to be 10/21/09.</p>
<p>This project will be funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for 2009. THERE IS REASONABLE CERTAINTY FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE. All reporting requirements from the Contractor are mandated per the Act. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.</p>

<DESC>The Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) is the Department of Defense (DoD) demonstration and validation program for environmental technologies.  The ESTCP Office is interested in receiving pre-proposals for innovative environmental and energy technology demonstrations that address DoD requirements as candidates for funding.  This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2).  Readers should note that this is an announcement to declare ESTCP's intent to competitively fund demonstration projects as described in the Program Announcement on the DoD ESTCP web site.<BR><BR>The Program Announcement and complete submittal instructions are found at www.estcp.org/opportunities.  No request for proposals (RFP), solicitation, or other announcement of this opportunity will be made.  Awards will take the form of contracts.  Submission of proposals is not restricted in any way to any particular entity.  The government will not pay for any costs associated with the preparation of proposals, travel to present oral presentations in support of the proposals, nor initial preparation and submission of a project plan. <BR><BR>To be eligible for consideration, readers wishing to respond to this announcement must submit a pre-proposal in accordance with the Instructions on the web site, no later than 4:00 PM Eastern Time on Thursday, March 4, 2010.  No electronic mail or faxed proposals will be accepted.  <BR>Awardees under this BAA will be selected through a two-stage review process.  The pre-proposal review step allows interested organizations to get initial Government feedback on their technologies without incurring the expense of a full proposal.  Based upon the pre-proposal evaluation by the Government, each of the pre-proposal submitters will be notified as to whether the Government encourages or does not encourage the submission of a full proposal.  Instructions for preparing a full proposal will be provided at the time of notification.  <BR>A request for submission of a full proposal does not indicate a decision has been made to make an award for that work.  There is no commitment by ESTCP to make any contract awards, nor to be responsible for any money expended by the offeror before contract award is made for a demonstration.  Multiple awards may be made to address a particular topic area.  It is expected that awards totaling approximately $20.0 million will result depending on availability of funds.  <BR><BR>For awards to be made as contracts, evaluation shall include the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small business, HUD Zone small business, small disadvantaged business, woman owned small business concerns, historically black colleges and universities, and minority institutions.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 and 541330 with the small business size standard of 500 employees.  In addition, contract proposals that exceed $550,000 submitted by all but small business concerns must be accompanied by a Small, Small Disadvantaged and Woman-Owned, Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9.  The HECSA Small Business Office web site at www.hecsa.usace.army.mil/hxsb provides information on how to prepare a subcontracting plan, along with links to find small businesses to participate.  The HECSA point of contact for non-technical issues is Mr. Damon Moore, 703-428-6117 and for the subcontracting plan is Ms. Kimberli Gray, 703-428-7385.  The point of contact for procedural questions the ESTCP Office is Ms. Jina Saunders, 703-696-2127.  For technical information regarding this announcement, contact the individual listed within the topic area descriptions.<BR><BR>* This BAA also falls into the Classification Codes C -- Architect & Engineering Services and F -- Natural Resources & Conservation Services.  In addition to NAICS code 541712, this BAA may also be classified under 541330 -- Engineering Services.

Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity  The VA Gulf Coast Veterans Health Care System (VAGCVHCS), Contracting Office, Biloxi, MS, proposes to enter into a contract on a basis other than full and open competition for the Facilities Management Service (FMS).  2.	Nature/Description of ActionA new firm fixed price services contract for preventative maintenance and repair of injectors is being contemplated under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  MEDRAD, Inc., 100 Global View Drive, Warrendale, PA  15086, is the proposed contractor and is the manufacturer of the injectors the VAGCVHCS (Joint Ambulatory Care Center) currently utilizes.  MEDRAD, Inc. is a large business.  As such, it will not be possible to comply with EO 13360 - Providing Opportunities for Service-Disabled Veteran Businesses to Increase Their Federal Contracting and Subcontracting, on this requirement.              3.	Description of Supplies/ServicesThe Facilities Management Service (FMS) at the VAGCVHCS requires preventative maintenance and repair of two (2) of its MEDRAD Injectors.  These injectors must remain in good repair and in constant service (or be brought quickly back into service) for the health, well-being, and protection of the VA's patients.      4.	Identification of Statutory Authority(X)  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1)   Only One Responsible Source(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (2)   Unusual and Compelling Urgency(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (3)   Industrial, Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental, or                                                                                                                                                     Research Capability or Expert Services(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (4)   International Agreement(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (5)   Authorized or Required by Statute(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (6)   National Security(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (7)   Public Interest5.	Rationale in support of citation in Paragraph 4 above:a.	Description of contractor and or of acquisition action that demonstrates that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:The VA's would like their two (2) MEDRAD Injectors (manufactured by MEDRAD, Inc.) put under a preventative maintenance and repair contract so that they are properly maintained and repaired immediately in the event of an equipment failure.  MEDRAD provides preventative maintenance and repair of their own injectors with their own in-house employees and does not subcontract out their work.  Also, the software used to calibrate the injectors is proprietary to MEDRAD.  In speaking with Mr. Mark Reyes, VA Biomedical Engineering Technician, it is possible for another company to calibrate another company's equipment due to similarities in calibration equipment but the only way to be exactly sure that the MEDRAD equipment is properly and accurately calibrated, which is what we want in a medical environment where patient medical care and safety is paramount, is to go directly to MEDRAD for the preventative maintenance and repair of our MEDRAD Injectors.     b.	Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practical:In accordance with FAR 5.201, a Presolicitation Notice will be posted on the FedBizOpps website notifying the commercial marketplace of the VAGCVHCS' intent to negotiate solely with MEDRAD, Inc. for preventative maintenance and repair services.  If any other potential offerors identify themselves at that time, we will immediately conduct additional market research to see if they can in fact provide the preventative maintenance and repair services required by the VAGCVHCS.  Initial Market Research conducted in this situation, however, tells us that in order to ensure that the injectors are properly and accurately calibrated, we must negotiate on a sole source basis with MEDRAD.            c.	If the Sole Source Exception (c) (1) was chosen, state the date of synopsis or the     basis for waivers.Once our VA Form 2268 is approved to proceed on a sole source basis, a Presolicitation Notice will be placed on FedBizOpps website that will relay the VAGCVHCS' intentions accordingly.       d. If the Urgency Exception was chosen and this J&A was prepared after the procurement action was carried out, state the reasons.	N/A      The above acquisition will be negotiated with:	N/A6.	Determination of a Fair and Reasonable CostThe Contracting Officer determines that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable because a complete analysis of all costs or a price analysis will be fully utilized prior to award of the contract.  The Independent Government Estimate will also be used as a tool in helping determine price fair and reasonableness.  We will also seek pricing support from other VA's that have preventative maintenance and repair contracts with MEDRAD for similar injectors.  By signing this justification, the Contracting Officer makes a determination that the costs/prices to the Government are expected to be fair and reasonable.         7.	A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.Market research was conducted by reviewing the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) Website to see what other VA's were doing with their MEDRAD Injectors.  We also contacted MEDRAD, Inc. to see if they had any subcontractor's who accomplished their injector preventative maintenance and repair services.  MEDRAD confirmed via telephone that they do not subcontract any of their injector preventative maintenance or repair work.  8.	Additional Support for the use of other than full and open competition:a. Explanation of why technical data, specifications, engineering descriptions, statement of work or purchase descriptions suitable for full open and competition have not been developed or are not available:	N/Ab. When the sole source exception is used in the case of a follow-on acquisition, provide an estimate of the cost that would be duplicated and describe how the estimate was derived if the contract is awarded to other than the incumbent:N/A.  This is not a follow-on acquisition as it is a brand new requirement for MEDRAD Injectors that are just coming off of the manufacturer's warranty.  c. When the urgency exception is cited provide the data, estimate of cost or other rationale as to the extent of harm to the government if the contract is not awarded expediently:	N/A9.	Sources expressing an interest:To date, no other sources have expressed an interest in providing injector preventative maintenance and repair services for the VAGCVHCS.  Once the Presolicitation Notice is published, any other sources of supply that are interested in providing preventative maintenance and repair services for the VAGCVHCS will identify themselves to us accordingly.    10. Actions, if any, being taken to remove barriers to full and open competition:We will continue to speak with MEDRAD, Inc. and will continue to monitor the commercial injector market for service trends.  We would welcome full and open competition both now and in the future for this type of acquisition but don't believe that we will ever see this happen until the VA purchases injectors that do not have calibration software that is propriety to the manufacturer (where only the manufacturer can properly and accurately calibrate the injectors).       11. Delivery Requirements:	Base Period: 	March 1, 2010 through September 30, 2010	1st Option Period:	October 1, 2010 through September 30, 2011	2nd Option Period:	October 1, 2011 through September 30, 2012	3rd Option Period:	October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2013	4th Option Period:	October 1, 2013 through September 30, 2014     12.  Acquisition Plan: An Acquisition Plan   (  ) is (X) is not required for this acquisition.     13.  IT Approval: IT Approval (  ) is (X) is not required for this acquisition. If it is, include             appropriate approvals.The assertions and recommendations in support of the justification have been prepared by://SIGNED//						January 6, 2009Marcos G. Reyes_______________________________________________________________________Technical Representative                                         Date                       Contracting Officers CertificationThe Contracting Officer has determined that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the Contracting Officer's knowledge and belief.//SIGNED//									January 6, 2009William A.

CPFF was suitable for this project because uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract.

<DESC>This announcement is for informational purposes only. The Federal Bureau of Investigation intends to negotiate a contract on a sole source basis to Tangibe Software, Inc. (Tangible), 6701 Democracy Blvd, Bethesda, MD 20817, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 for Vidar Operations and Maintenance. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-30. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541330. A quote is being solicited under Solicitation No. D20002778. This will be a cost plus fixed fee contract. Tangible possesses unique expertise and knowledge of the application software and past software releases. Continued timely operations and maintenance support for BACE as it transitions to Vidar is essential to meet the FBI's mission. The change to a new contractor at this point in time would unnecessarily stop all current upgrade work and would require another 6-9 months to bring another contractor to the level of understanding and expertise. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. If any interested party would like to be considered for award, please submit a written statement indicating your interest as well as a brief corporate capability that supports legal rights and unique technical qualifications and experience to fulfill this requirement by close of business (3:00 pm) on January 14, 2010 to Abigail Marr, Contracting Officer, at abigail.marr@ic.fbi.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement is based upon responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government. Contracting Office Address: 935 Pennsylvania Ave, NW, Washington, DC 20535. Place of Performance: Federal Bureau of Investigation, 935 Pennsylvania Ave, NW, Washington, DC 20535. Primary Point of Contact: Abigail Marr, Contracting Officer, abigail.marr@ic.fbi.gov, Fax: 202-324-3104
