Majorchanges are contemplated because the part has a low process yield or hasdemonstrated marginal performance during tests or service use. These changeswill render the present part obsolete and unusable in its present configuration.Limited acquisition from the present source is anticipated pending configurationchanges. -SEE NOTES 9, 26

This field course will be focused for designers, contractors, and building officials in coastal Texas to address issues such as construction in V and A Zones, designing for flood and wind loads, construction and maintenance issues, utility issues, and septic systems in the flood zone. The goal is to provide guidance and assistance on specific coastal construction issues to reduce future damages to residential buildings in coastal areas. FEMA 55 (published in 1985) was revised and released in 2000 and incorporates much of what has been learned from the effects of many major storms over the last 13 years. This 2-day field course was developed for architects, engineers, and building officials to familiarize them with the contents of the manual and provide the information they need to ensure that coastal residential buildings are properly sited, designed, and constructed. The course has been recently updated with new information on best practices, current codes and standards and lessons learned in recent hurricanes from 2004 to the present. <br /><br />The contractor will provide two instructors to teach the 2-day field version of the FEMA 55 Coastal Construction Manual Course. The course will take place in coastal Texas. An additional day of travel will be required as the location requires that the instructors travel on the day prior to and the day after the course. <br /><br />There should be two instructors. They should be well-versed in coastal construction and the design of residential structures. At a minimum, they should have experience instructing building science related courses for FEMA (such as the FEMA EMI E 386 training course for Residential Coastal Construction) or courses taught elsewhere based on FEMA's authoritative guidance on coastal construction (FEMA 55, FEMA 499, FEMA 550 and MAT Reports). Instructors shall be nationally recognized experts with favorable student evaluations from past courses. They should have 8-10 years experience and should be a licensed engineer or architect. Instructors should be able to document past involvement in writing or reviewing FEMA Building Science publications as well as participation on FEMA Mitigation Assessment Team Building Performance Studies (MAT Reports). One instructor will need to cover history and background of coastal hazards, codes and regulations, and must be able to teach the flood load determination and foundation design section of the course. The other instructor will need to cover wind design and load determination on buildings as well as the overall coastal building design process. Instructors are to have demonstrated knowledge of FEMA's building performance standards, guidance documents and Mitigation programs.</p>
<p>The newly updated 2-day CCM materials can be made available by FEMA headquarters for qualified instructors for course delivery in January 2009.</p>

In addition, NETLengagesin other research complementary to its mission, including reimbursable workandwork for others.The vast majority of DOE FE work done within NETL ORD resides within one offour Focus Areas.  These Focus Areas comprise related fields of experience,activity, or knowledge that generally align with one or more of the fundinglines that are dictated by Congressional appropriation and make up the DOEFEresearch program.  They provide a technical, rather than administrative,rationale for organizing research, and assist in ensuring that projects arefunded from appropriate budget lines.  A description of the current FocusAreascan be found on the NETL web site at:http://www.netl.doe.gov/onsite_research/index.html.NETL has initiated an electronic reading room as part of the strategy toprovide information that may benefit potential offerors in preparing theirproposals.

<DESC>Clarifications for Announcement  N6000090200
Please note that this is not a Request for Proposals.  This is a notice of the opportunity to submit Standard Form 330 for evaluation for consideration of award for a contract for Architect and Engineering Services.  Please submit a letter of interest and the SF330.  A solicitation will follow the evaluation of the responses to this request.  Firms will be notified of their inclusion on a short list.
Q.  What is the difference between the announcements N6000090100 and N6000090200?A.  The ONLY difference between these two announcements is that N6000090100 is 100% Set Aside for Small Business and N6000090200 is open to all competition both small and large business under the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program.
Q.  When is the response due?A.  Responses are due January 6, 2009.
Q.  Can we reply alone as an individual architectural firm, or should we gather professionals from the other disciplines needed and apply as a team?A.  The Standard Form 330 must demonstrate the ability of the respondent to meet, individually or as a team , ALL of the requirements noted under the description of services.
Q.  How do I access Numbered Note 24?A.  Go to http://www.fbodaily.com/fbo/notes.html
Q.  How can I get the Standard Form 330?A.  The SF330 in WORD format is available at http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/formslibrary.do?viewType=DETAIL&formId=21DBF5BF7E860FC185256E13005C6AA6
Q. Is this a readvertisement of a current contract?A.  Yes.  The incumbent contractors are:	Ratio Architects, Inc., 107 S. Pennsylvania St., Suite 100, Indianapolis, IN 46204	Bahr Vermeer Haecker Architects, Ltd, 440 N 8th Street, Ste 100, Lincoln, NE 68508	Quinn Evans Architects, 219  N. Main Street, Ann Arbor, MI 48104
Q.  Is it in the best interest of a small business to respond to both of these notices?A.  Small businesses may submit under both notices.  You must submit a separate package for each notice.
Q.  Is there a bidders' list?A.  There is no bidders list associated with this notice. 
Q.  Realistically speaking, how many projects will occur during the course of 1 year, and what would be the ideal size of the firm you would select.A.  The Government cannot predict the number or size of requirements we may have under these contracts.  In the past we have selected firms of varying sizes, however, respondents must have all the required disciplines either in house or by teaming with other firms.
Q.  Will forms other than the Standard Form 330 be acceptable?A.  No.
Q.  Can a small business as prime add large firms as sub-consultants to cover specialty disciplines and geographic coverage and still meet the 100% Small Business Set Aside?  A.   Yes, however, the small business must be prepared to perform at least 50% of the work required under the contract.  A large portion of the work under this contract will be related to historic properties i.e. studies and construction documents for rehabilitation, restoration of those properties and other historic studies of landscapes and buildings which are not related to construction.
