<DESC>Maintenance And Logistics Support For Harmonic Cancellation Systems The FAA requires maintenance and logistics support for Harmonic Cancellation Systems at Maintenance Processor Subsystem (MPS) sites, Alaskan NAS Interfacility Communication System (ANICS) sites, and Data Multiplexing Network (DMN) sites.  HCS's are also installed at various other Air Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs), Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) facilities, and Automated Flight Service Stations (AFSSs).  The contractor would furnish all labor, tools, test equipment, parts, and software, as well as technical and administrative support to completely maintain the systems.  The systems were manufactured by Power Distribution, Inc. of Richmond, VA.   The HCS's are primarily 15kVA and 20 kVA "Power-Pak" units.  Nationwide coverage, including Alaska and Puerto Rico, is required.   Contractor responsibilities include: Â·	On-site remedial and preventive maintenance of HCSs while ensuring that the HCS is maintained and kept in a serviceable working condition; Â·	Provision of all maintenance material, tools, documentation, diagnostics, and test equipment necessary for the repair and remedial maintenance of the systems while repairing the HCS to the extent necessary to restore the equipment such that it is capable of meeting all operational functional requirements for which it was designed; Â·	Semi-annual preventive maintenance checks for which a schedule is provided to the FAA at the beginning of each contract year and for which the Contractor is responsible for reassembling, calibrating, and functionally testing the equipment to ensure that repaired equipment meets all operational and functional requirements; Â·	Ensuring that adequate sparing resources are available to meet contractually designated repair times and that replacement parts are of Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) specifications and quality; and Â·	Performing harmonic distortion analysis of all systems as required by the FAA.   The current contractor and potential known source for this effort is: Power Distribution, Inc. 4200 Oakleys Court Richmond, VA  23223 The FAA is surveying the market to seek additional potential sources capable of meeting technical and delivery requirements.  The requirement begins 1 January 2006.   Any vendor that believes it can provide these services is invited to submit a statement of capabilities (in contractor format) addressing its abilities to meet the above requirements.  The FAA will use the vendor statements to determine the extent of industry capabilities for the requirements, not as mechanisms with which to screen down or select.  Statements of capabilities are due by 2pm EST on 22 August 2005.  The FAA suggests that the interested vendors send capability statements by overnight mail.  Vendors may email the contracting officer at matt.asai@faa.gov to confirm receipt of their statements. This is not a request for proposals. Please send statements to: Federal Aviation Administration Attn: Matthew Asai, ATO-A, Room 507 800 Independence Avenue, SW Washington, DC 20591 Email any questions to Matthew Asai at matt.asai@faa.gov This announcement was originally posted at http://www.asu.faa.gov/faaco/index.cfm .

OFFERORS MUST SUBMIT PROOF OF SUCH CURRENT DESIGNATION WITH THEIR OFFERS. SAFETY ANALYTICS FLIGHT STANDARDS CERTIFICATION AND SURVEILLANCE DIVISION AFS-900 Background: The FAA is responsible for maintaining safety surveillance over the United States national aviation system.  In order to enhance it's capability to perform this statutory mission, the FAA has developed and implemented information technology based systems designed to collect, maintain, monitor and analyze aviation safety data. The United States Congress recently provided direction to the FAA to enhance these capabilities via House Report 108-671 - Departments of Transportation And Treasury And Independent Agencies Appropriations Bill, 2005. The Report directed the FAA to improve aviation safety by acquiring state-of-the-art analytical tools. Specifically, the bill states:  "Safety and security analytics project --The recommendation includes $1,000,000 to initiate the safety and security analytics project.  Current software is available to analyze electronic text found in descriptions of accidents, incidents, pilot and controller reports, and other databases to determine trends, patterns, and anomalies earlier than using other methods.  This technology will help FAA meet its long-term goal of reducing the fatal accident rate among air carriers by focusing on long-term trends rather than specific cases." Section 2:  Objective: This SOW shall achieve the following specific objectives: â€¢ Assist the FAA in the development and implementation of an automated aviation centric thesaurus that supports the FAA's safety monitoring and surveillance programs. â€¢ Assist the FAA in the demonstration of a text-mining analytical tool.
