<DESC>NOTICE OF PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION (NOPCA):  The Electronic Systems Center, Cryptologic Systems Contracting Division (ESC/HNCK), Lackland AFB, San Antonio TX, intends to award on a sole source basis a firm-fixed-price requirements-type contract for the production of ACTS (AEHF COMSEC TRANSEC SYSTEM) hardware supporting the AEHF (Advanced Extremely High Frequency) Program. The proposed contract action will have a five- year ordering period to procure various quantities of CLIN 0001 KI-54, CLIN 0002 KI-56, CLIN 0003 KGV-136B, CLIN 0004 KGV-136C, CLIN 0005 KGV-136R, CLIN 0006 VPC-B, CLIN 0007 VPC-XB, CLIN 0008 VPC-C, CLIN 0009 VPC-XC, CLIN 0010 VPC-BIP.  The ACTS hardware was developed by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) L-3 Communications East, 1 Federal Street, Camden, NJ. 08103, CAGE CODE: 11447.  The ACTS hardware was developed as a propriety product in support of the AEHFCommunications Security (COMSEC) hardware.  The place of contract performance will be L-3 Communications East, 1 Federal Street, Camden, NJ. 08103, CAGE CODE: 11447.  The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source IAW 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one (1) responsible source.  The Air Force's lack of complete specifications, schematics/drawings and parts lists precludes use of Full and Open Competition procedures to satisfy this requirement.  L-3 Communications East is the only vendor known to the Air Force capable of producing the ACTS hardware, because as the OEM it has the required engineering knowledge, expertise, and complete drawing package to do so.  An ESC Ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition.  Before consulting the Ombudsman concerned parties should first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the Contracting Officer for consideration.  IAW AFFARS 5352.201-9101, the ability to contact an Ombudsman will be included in this acquisition's solicitation and contract. The ESC Ombudsman can be contacted at: ESC Ombudsman, Bldg 1606, 9 Eglin Street, Hanscom AFB, MA  01731, Telephone #:  781-377-5106, Facsimile #:  781-377-4659, E-Mail: ESC.Ombudsman@hanscom.af.mil.  If a firm believes it is capable of meeting the Government's requirement, it may identify their interest and capability to the Contracting Officer, Ralph Urias, 210-977-4913, ralph.urias@us.af.mil within fifteen (15) days of this publication.  Those interested firms must indicate whether they are a large, small, and small-disadvantaged, 8(a), or women owned business and whether they are U.S. or foreign owned.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  See Note 26.

<SUBJECT>Dynamic Testing of Equipment Mounts and Interior Cabinets used in the Ambulance Patient Compartment
<SOLNBR>2012-Q-14291
<RESPDATE>122711
<ARCHDATE>02292012
<CONTACT>Margaret L Mooney, Purchasing Agent, Email zia3@cdc.gov
<DESC>PRE SOLICITATION NOTICE: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Division of Safety Research, Morgantown, WV, has a requirement for Dynamic Testing of Equipment Mounts and Interior Cabinets used in the Ambulance Patient Compartment.
<p>The CDC intends to award a single Firm-Fixed-Price Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13. The period of performance is 1 March 2012 through 1 January 2013.</p>
<p>Background and Need</p>
<p>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), in partnership with the National Truck Equipment Association's Ambulance Manufacturers Division (NTEA-AMD), is working to improve worker and patient safety in the patient compartment of U.S. based ambulances. This collaborative work builds on completed research performed by NIOSH under past NIOSH funded projects. The first outcome from this collaborative effort was the development of AMD Standard 025, "Measuring Guidelines: Occupant Head Clearance Zones".</p>
<p>Together, NIOSH and the NTEA are continuing to investigate opportunities to improve the structural integrity of the patient compartment, seating systems, the patient litter, and equipment location and mounting utilizing existing NIOSH data. To that end, NIOSH, the NTEA-AMD, and its members have developed SAE J2917 "Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice for Occupant Restraint and Equipment Mounting Integrity - Frontal Impact System-Level Ambulance Patient Compartment" to characterize the response of an ambulance when subjected to a full frontal crash into a barrier at 30 mph. (Reference 1)</p>
<p>Likewise, the partners have worked diligently to develop a companion "SAE Recommended Practice" to characterize an ambulance's response in a side impact event. Through a separate solicitation, the partners conducted four (4) side impact tests during the summer of 2010. The resulting dataset was used to support the development of the SAE J2956 "Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice for Occupant Restraint and Equipment Mounting Integrity - Side Impact System-Level Ambulance Patient Compartment" published in June 2011. (Reference 2)</p>
<p>With these two SAE recommended practices in hand as input dynamic loading, NIOSH and its partners, through this solicitation, now seek to complete the following: (1) validate the proposed AMD test procedures for testing equipment mounting as described in Equipment Mount Test Research - PROPOSED - DRAFT- January 22, 2011 (Reference 3); (2) validate the proposed AMD test procedures for testing interior cabinet doors in Reference 3; and, (3) conduct static and dynamic testing of simulated mounting devices such that a dynamic-to-static load factor may be generated through statistical analysis.</p>
<p>The broad goal of this effort is to validate the test procedures outlined in Reference 3 which is intended to verify that equipment mounting and interior cabinet doors are crashworthy. The successful Offeror's test program would essentially follow the test requirements, conditions, and procedures described in Reference 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Project Objectives</p>
<p>This contract will validate both the test procedures and potentially the crashworthiness of individual EMS equipment mounts, cabinet closures, and/or latching mechanisms. Further, this contracting effort will yield data that supports the development of a generic dynamic load factor for use in design and testing of equipment mounts suitable for use in the patient compartment of an ambulance. At the completion of this testing program the Contractor will have created a series of datasets which will:</p>
<p>A. Validate the testing metodolgies described in Reference 3 pertinent to equipment mount integrity.</p>
<p>B. Validate the testing methodologies described in Reference 3 pertinent to cabinet door and door latching integrity.</p>
<p>C. Provide the underlying data needed to thoughtfully establish a generic dynamic-to-static design load factor.</p>
<p>References;</p>
<p>1. SAE J2917 "Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice for Occupant Restraint and Equipment<br />Mounting Integrity - Frontal Impact System-Level Ambulance Patient Compartment, May 2010</p>
<p>2. SAE J2956 "Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice for Occupant Restraint and Equipment<br />Mounting Integrity - Side Impact System-Level Ambulance Patient Compartment, June 2011</p>
<p>3. Equipment Mount Test Research - PROPOSED - DRAFT- January 22, 2011</p>
<p>4. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) No. 213 "Child Restraint Systems"</p>
<p>5. SAE J211-1 "Instrumentation for Impact Test - Part 1: Electronic Instrumentation"</p>
<p>6. SAE J211-2 "Instrumentation for Impact Test - Part 2: Photographic Instrumentation"</p>
<p>(Note: Equipment Mount Test Research DRAFT - see attachment: References)</p>
<p><br />Technical Understanding, Management, Approach and Experience:</p>
<p>The degree to which the Contractor can demonstrate his ability to complete equipment mount and cabinet door integrity testing, within a sled test environment, to aid in the validation of Reference 3. Also, the degree to which the Contractor can demonstrate his understanding and approach to deriving a dynamic-to-static design factor for ambulance equipment mounts.</p>
<p>1. Demonstrate an understanding of the approach needed to test equipment mounts in order to<br />validate Section 1 through Section 7 of Reference 3.</p>
<p>2. Demonstrate an understanding of the approach needed to test cabinet door and latch integrity in order to validate Section 8 through Section 11 of Reference 3.</p>
<p>3. Demonstrate an understanding of the dynamic-to-static design factor issue. Provide a description of the approach the Contractor recommends to develop these dynamic-to-static factors. If different from the methodology proposed by the Government, provide explanation as to why the Conttactor's proposed method is superior.</p>
<p>4. Describe the Contractor's approach to acquire or develop the test assets not otherwise provided as GFE.</p>
<p>5. The degree to which the proposed personnel are qualified to perform the work.</p>
<p>6. The degree to which the contractor has experience with work of similar scope, magnitude and<br />complexity.</p>
<p>Equipment:<br />7. The availability of sled test equipment to perform sled tests to the pulses of Reference 1,<br />Reference 2, and Reference 4.</p>
<p>Location:<br />8. Proximity of the testing facility within 400 miles of the NIOSH Morgantown facility.</p>
<p>The complete solicitation document, and reference material, if applicable, will be available for downloading at www.fedbizopps.gov on or about January 13, 2012 and quotes will be due on or about January 30, 2012. No verbal or written requests for copies will be accepted. It is the responsibility of perspective offerors to stay abreast of additional postings regarding this solicitation at the FedBizOpps internet site.</p>
<p>No government-wide notes apply. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov</p>
<p>All responsible responsive sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.<br />Based on availability of funds, the government may exercise options for additional specimen tests during fiscal year FY12</p>

<DESC>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to Peter Kiewit Institute Technology Development Corporation, 1110 S 67th Street, PKI 301, Omaha, NE 68182, for an effort entitled "Shielding Effectiveness of Conductive Concrete, Phase II". The objective of this effort is to continue the development of a conductive concrete formulation that is based on taconite aggregates. The shielding effectivess of this concrete against the effects of high altitude electromagnetic pulse will be determined. Further, a test article will be made from the concrete and tested using the MIL-STD -188-125 Appendix A protocol. Additional testing of the place/pourability, workability, and constructability of the conductive concrete will be performed as well as testing to verify its structural integrity. The goal of this effort will be to determine if this conductive concrete formulation can be used in military facilities required to be tested to MIL-STD-188-125. The statutory authority for this non-competitive action is (10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source, and is supported by an approved Justification and Approval. This notice of contract action is not a request for competitive proposals; no formal solicitation will be issued as a result of this announcement.

<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.<br />The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC><strong>Contracting Office Address<br /></strong>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, EPS Suite 600, Room 6068, Rockville, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.<br /><strong>Description <br /></strong>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR) plans to procure on a sole source basis with Becton, Dickinson, and Company, 2350 Qume Drive; San Jose, CA 95131 for two upgrades for two FACS Aria I Cell sorters.<br /><br />This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).<br /><br />Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees. <br /><br />The FACS Core Facility houses 2 FACS Aria I cell sorters that are in use all day Monday - Friday and some evenings and weekends. The contractor shall provide an upgrade that essentially rebuilds the entire fluidics path and replaces the flow cell and sort chamber. The stability of the fluidics system will be improved by installing a new pressurization system. The new fluidics system will allow much easier and efficient instrument sterilization and will provide improved aseptic conditions. Removing and replacing many of the pinch valves, the HPLC valve, and the plenums in the fluidics path will remove difficult-to-sterilize sites that can become sources of bacterial contamination. The new square flow cell design means more precise laser focusing which will improve the fluorescence detection on larger cells such as cancer cell lines. The upgrade includes new ceramic nozzles instead of metal ones; the ceramic ones will have a longer life than the metal ones. The new design of the ceramic nozzles will greatly simplify changing nozzles when a different size is needed. The new nozzles are much easier to insert and remove and fit more securely; this will greatly shorten the daily setup time. It will also allow a more standardized and reproducible sort setup from user to user which will improve the quality of the sorting. There is also a new fixed design for the deflection plates that will provide better reproducibility and more side-stream stability. <br /><br />The 2 FACS Aria cell sorters are in daily use serving about 100 investigators from 25 NCI labs. BD Biosciences introduced a major upgrade package for these instruments which will rebuild the fluidics pathway, cuvette and sort chamber of the sorters. This will provide increased stability, reproducibility, maintenance of sterility, and ease and speed of daily setup. The newly designed cuvette will allow improved optical signal detection from certain kinds of cells frequently used in NCI research. The FACS Aria design of the original sorter and the upgraded sorter are proprietary to BD Biosciences and cannot be provided by any other vendor. The software that runs the instrument and provides for semi-automated setup and quality control with the requested upgrade is also available only from BD Biosciences. <br /><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisitions on or before 11:00 AM EST on December 28, 2011. No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax), an original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions at the address stated above. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Erin Breedlove, Contract Specialist at breeerin@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov. No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference solicitation number NCI-120016-EB on all correspondence.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The TRACES Cost Book currently has approximately 69,000 task items and is updated every two years and the Area Cost Factors are updated every year. Area Cost Factors (both CONUS and OCONUS) are used by the Department of Defense for calculating the cost of general construction at a specific military installation as compared to a "National Average". The database will support several DOD automated information systems. These services will be acquired using North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541513 (Computer Facilities Management Services). The IDIQ contract will have a capacity not-to-exceed $5.6 Million over a one-year base and 3 one-year option periods. Since these services are commercial, the simplified acquisition procures of FAR 13.5 will be used for solicitation and award.

The Cost Book must be an item that is readily available for purchase by the general public and includes material cost, labor items, equipment items, crew makeup and productivity. This item may be somewhat customized at the user's request. This level of customization for the customer is considered standard within the cost book industry. Additionally, the contractor will perform market research to provide additional cost information, such as material prices on government maintained tasks, as requested.  In addition, this Cost Book Support contract includes provisions for updating the Area Cost Factors.  A yearly survey is performed to update the database used by the Area Cost Factors software application. The following items may also be required by the contractor as a part of this acquisition: telephone hotline support, other economic surveys, electronic database distribution, technical documentation preparation, database management, other commercially available data such as, but not limited to, assembly and square foot cost data, life cycle cost data, etc. The solicitation document will be available on fbo.gov on/about 8 July 2011. <br><br>

15)	Environmental issues known to exist on the site and any remediation efforts to taken or to-bhe-taken. 

Note: The VA will pay no more than the appraised fair market rental value for space. 
Usable square footage should be determined as follows:
If the space is on a single tenancy floor, compute the inside gross area by measuring between the inside finish of the permanent exterior building walls or from the face of the convectors (pipes or other wall-hung fixtures) if the convector occupies at lease 50-percent of the length of exterior walls.

If the space is on a multiple tenancy floor, measure from the inside finish of the permanent exterior building walls as above and to the room side finish of the fixed corridor and shaft walls and/or the center of tenant-separating partitions. 

In all measurements, make no deductions for columns and projections enclosing the structural elements of the building and deduct the following from the gross area including their enclosing walls:

1)	public toilets and lounges,
2)	stairwells ,
3)	elevators and escalator shafts,
4)	building equipment and service areas,
5)	entrance and elevator lobbies, stacks and shafts, and

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION; no award will be made as a result of this request.  This request for information (RFI) is for informational purposes only; this is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  All interested parties are encouraged to respond to this RFI. The Government will not pay for information and materials received in response to this RFI, and is in no way obligated by the information received.<br><br>1.0 SCOPE:  <br>The Rapid Equipping Force (REF) has a requirement to purchase Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) to support Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Shortfalls in the environmentally inhospitable operating environment of Afghanistan.   This requirement includes a requirement for operators and Field Service Representatives (FSRs) to provide FSR support and new equipment training.   The UAS shall provide for remote, safe, persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance.  The airship must stay on station even in less favorable environmental conditions that would ground UAS of comparable size, features, or classification.<br><br>The platform shall have a capability for Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL).  The platform shall be a lighter than air (LTA) platform that is easily deployable in either a mobile or tethered state.  The Airship shall remain functional while flying even in non-ideal conditions.  The Airship must fly in winds up to but not less than 25 knot winds.  The system shall be deployable utilizing no more than two Soldiers.  The Airship shall have an active onboard systems ("smart aerostat") its fins will continue to use their movable surfaces to stabilize and trim the UAS, safety systems will prevent fly always in the event that the tether line was cut.<br><br>Mechanically, the Airship platform shall incorporate a modular design for ease of manufacturing and flexible payload configuration.  The configurable sensor pod can house a wide array of active or passive sensing devices.  A communications interface and main system power is available from the airship's underbelly wire harness for command, feedback and sensor power.  System components are further broken out into separate gondolas.   The Airship housing shall contain computing and system internal sensors and the black gondola houses propulsion means.  The driving motivation for this further separation is elevated system performance from further mechanically and electrically isolating vital components.  Vital system components are further protected by ballistic fabric to mitigate the risk of small arms fire and even if the envelope takes direct hit the Altus can still fly safely for another 30 minutes.  The airship envelope contains cascaded safety systems to allow for easy retrieval of the UAS in case of an emergency.  A protective tarp to tether down the airship during inflation & inclement weather is required.  For safe launches and landing there are two key features implemented into the Propulsion gondola, sensors that calculate if the system is being held and a landing skid to keep the motors out of ground debris.  <br>Payloads are able to interact on a variety of common protocols including CAN, RS232, MIL-STD-1553, and SPI.  The software has transparent safety features that do not allow the end user to put the system at risk.  e.g. statistically sampled in flight power monitoring is used to calculate a safe radius around the SiLO command and control system, if the end user attempts to set the next way point outside the bounds its power radius SiLO refuses the coordinate.  Other software features based on sensor feedback like automated inflation assure that little training is necessary to successfully deploy and use the Airship.  Another extension of the self preservation is the Return Home feature, which returns to the last known point of transmission from SiLO.  Features like SiLO constantly updating the robot with its position allow for safer flight and mobility of the command and control unit as well.<br><br>2.0 Requirements:<br>Dimensions:<br>a.	Airship shall be no longer than 26ft (T), 23 ft (O)<br>b.	Diameter shall be no greater than 12 ft (T), 9 ft (O)<br><br>Features:  <br>a.	Airship shall be white or clear in color <br>b.

INL/AP provides policy guidance and develops, and monitors programs to address the full range of criminal justice issues as they relate to stabilization and reconstruction activities in Afghanistan and Pakistan. INL has been engaged in an effort with the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) to build the capacity of the Afghan justice sector, specifically including its ability to process national security crimes. Program activities include institutional capacity building; professionalizing justice sector personnel through legal education and training initiatives; fostering coordination within the criminal justice system especially between police, prosecutors, courts, and prisons; creating conditions in which Afghan Constitutional and international human rights guarantees can be upheld; increasing public awareness and access to justice; and extending the formal justice system throughout the country while working with the traditional systems to provide alternative dispute resolution.</p>

The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, and DOS financial operating procedures and policies. The incumbent is recognized as a substantive authority on overall management and/or interpretation of guidance on program and project planning and evaluation in a specialized area.</p>
<p>Complexity</p>
<p>Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program. Coordinating plans with various other groups including international donors, the U.S. military and the Government of Afghanistan can be complicated.</p>
<p>Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact other programs. They are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features, technical, administrative, or political in nature.</p>
<p>Physical Demands</p>
<p>In Afghanistan, the work is principally sedentary, however frequent travel in and around, or being stationed in Afghanistan provinces, is likely. While on a site visit there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances - the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships. Extended onsite visits to remote project sites will occasionally be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain. Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult. Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s). Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE / REQUEST FOR INFORMATION; not a pre-solicitation notice or solicitation for proposals/quotations. Pursuant to FAR Part 10 (Market Research), the purpose of this notice is to: (1) determine if sources capable of satisfying the agency's requirements exists, (2) determine if commercial items suitable to meet the agency's needs are available or could be modified to meet the agency's requirements, and (3) determine the commercial practices of company's engaged in providing the needed service or supply. Pursuant to FAR Part 6 and FAR Part 19, competition and set-aside decisions may be based on the results of this market research. This notice in no way obligates the Government to any further action.
Requirement: This notice is issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs, Boston VA Healthcare System, West Roxbury, MA to identify sources capable of providing the following:
VISN 1 Contracting is conducting market research on mobile cardiac telemetry devices and monitoring services.  We are requesting brand name or equal products that compare to the product information and salient characteristics for the ZIO Patch Mobile Cardiac Telemetry Devices and Arrhythmia monitoring service manufactured and monitored by IRhythm Technologies.   Please see the following product information and salient characteristics below.
Product Information/Salient Characteristics
The Zio Patch is a long-term cardiac rhythm monitor that provides continuous monitoring for up-to-14 days (significantly longer than the time period of a typical Holter). By providing a longer time period of continuous recording, the Zio Patch improves the likelihood of capturing arrhythmias and provides for an equal or higher diagnostic yield versus other devices on the market.  Diagnostic findings are not reported until the device is returned to Rhythm Technologies and will be posted to their website for review and printing for final interpretation by Cardiologist.  

The Zio Patch is indicated for use on patients who may be asymptomatic or who may suffer from transient symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, light-headedness, presyncope and syncope, shortness of breath, anxiety and fatigue. As with all iRhythm products, the Zio Patch is 100% recyclable. No part of the device will end up in a landfill, minimizing the impact of disposable devices on the environment.

Intended Use:  The ZIO Patch will be applied to upper left chest of patient and to be worn up to 14 days to monitor patient's rate and rhythm. It is a diagnostic tool to aid physicians in the treatment of their patients with arrhythmia problems or to rule out arrhythmia problems due to various symptoms.
Benefits:
"	Easy for patient to use:  Apply and remove device from chest after monitoring period.  The ZIO Patch has no electrodes, lead wires or telephone to wear as with "real time" event monitoring devices.  
"	Can be worn during showering (though not to be immersed in water completely as in swimming), thus eliminating breaks in monitoring period.

"	Depending upon indications for use, can save considerable costs with use of the device and less ordering of more expensive monitoring device for real time monitoring.

"	Offers longer periods of monitoring than standard 24 or 48 hour monitors to capture infrequent but questionable symptoms of palpitations, dizziness, etc.

<DESC>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has an ongoing requirement for lease of antenna sites at site-specific locations. ATF has determined that it is in the Government's best interest to award these requirements with a base year and up to four option years. The vendor names, site locations, and estimated costs (for Years 2012-2016) are identified below.
<p>&bull; Miller Communications, Inc.; Sumter, SC./WICI-FM Tower; Estimated Value $66,820.44</p>
<p>These contractors retain ownership of the individual towers where ATF's communications equipment is located. These sites were selected based on a survey conducted to determine what sites could meet the needs of ATF's Private Land Mobile (LMR) system which provides administrative and tactical radio communication coverage needs. Criterion includes:<br />1) Provides the maximum transmit capability<br />2) Receives coverage range for clear as well as encrypted transmissions<br />3) Provides minimal interference on receive frequency<br />4) Provides the best level of safety for ATF agents in the field<br />5) Equipment housing facility and height<br />6) Utility support<br />7) Security<br />8) RF noise level/interference<br />9) Site access<br />10) Telco Access <br />11) Cost</p>
<p>In support of ATF's LMR systems' infrastructure needs, communication equipment is installed and housed in various locations throughout the Continental US, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Alaska. The locations include remote, mountainous, rural, and/or metropolitan sites. A yearly site lease is established where ATF communications equipment is housed and renewed annually thereafter as long as there is an existing need for LMR coverage to support ATF operations. THIS IS A PARTIAL SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 515112 with a size standard of $7.0 million dollars. Any award resulting from this requirement will be issued pursuant to FAR Part12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. If you feel that your firm possesses the ability to provide this service, at the above designated locations, interested parties may submit technical literature showing their capability of meeting the Government's requirement by December 27, 2010 at 11:00 AM EST. E-mail your response demonstrating your firms experience and capabilities to Danielle.Thompson2@atf.gov</p>

 JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION for SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS OVER $3,000 AND UP TO $100,000 (See FAR 13.106-1)
Date:             12-12-2011                                            		   PR Number:      1574-12-2343	  
1.	Nature and/or description of the item/service being procured and its intended use (include the anticipated cost): 
YNP needs to purchase exact replacement parts for the axles on a Walters Snow Fighter Snow Plow.  Due to the Walters axle parts obsolescence, the original axles and drive train were replaced by Weller Manufacturing.  To insure the parts are direct replacements in fit, torque requirements, structural material and engineering, we are sole sourcing these components. The replacement parts are direct replacement components provided in the original replacement of the axles currently used on the Walters Snow Plow.  The Walters Snow Plow is a critical piece of equipment used during the spring opening operations.  The snow must be removed from the road ways in a safe and timely manner so that the visitors to YNP can enjoy the Park per published opening dates set by Park Management and its Partners.  The anticipated cost of these parts is$ 5904.69.
2.  Sole Source Justification rationale  (Check one and explain below):
X  only one responsible source.        Urgent and compelling circumstances exist.        Other   
Weller Heavy Duty Drive Train Components is the original installer of these components to insure proper fit and torque requirements we are requesting the parts be purchased from the original equipment installer.  Yellowstone National Park will pick up the axle components on the return trip from picking up the refurbished Walters Snow Plow, which will reduce the shipping expenditure of axle shafts, drive yokes, seals and gaskets. The total shipping amount saved is more than $2000.00 dollars.  
3.  Market Research.  Please explain the results or why one was not performed. State whether any other offers were received or anyone expressed interest:  
Due to the critical nature of these axle components Yellowstone National Park is requesting original equipment parts.  To insure the components are direct replacement parts we are requesting these components are provided from Weller Truck.

4.  If this is a determination for sole source, the Contracting Officer certifies:
a.	Only one source is available, or urgent and compelling circumstances exist. b.	The anticipated price will be determined fair and reasonable using the price analysis techniques described in FAR Part 13.106-3(a).

<DESC><p>DCPO requires contracted services for analytical and technical support required to meet DoD-wide corrosion prevention and mitigation objectives. The DCPO requires broad-based research and analytic support to provide a sound foundation for current requirements and future concepts related to developing and conducting DoD corrosion prevention and mitigation efforts within a continually changing environment. Examples of these efforts include linking research to practical application, determining corrosion-related capabilities, and attaining the most effective mix in public/private solutions. The contractor must demonstrate a comprehensive knowledge of the DoD acquisition and logistics enterprise, a high degree of technical competence with regard to DoD weapon systems and infrastructure maintenance and corrosion prevention/mitigation operations, and an in-depth understanding of defense logistics operations, life cycle programming, services, and policy. Because the prevention or mitigation of corrosion on DoD equipment and facilities requires both public and private support, the contractor must also demonstrate objectivity and independence of thought, and not be influenced by company business lines of services or products.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St., SW JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202-475-3904</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St., SW JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202-475-3904</p>

The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.

If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

MCAGCC Access/Security Requirements-Contractor and Contractor-Employee Access Conditions:   

1.  Access Procedures Are Mandatory:  All contractor employees are required to obtain business access or permanent business access.  Daily access procedures must not be used to circumvent background check requirements outlined below.  Attempts to improperly use daily access procedures may result in denial of access to the involved employees. 

2.   Business Access:  Required for contractor employees requiring access for periods from one day to one year.
  Submit the following:  

	A valid form of Federal or state government I.D.
	If driving a motor vehicle, a valid driver's license, vehicle registration and proof
	of insurance.
	Proof of employment on a valid Government contract (e.g., a letter from the
	prime contractor including contract number and term).
	Proof of an employee background check conducted within the past year
	covering the previous two years.  Contractor employee background checks are
	conducted at contractor expense.  The background check:

(a)	must establish the employee's citizenship or legal alien status.  Acceptable documents include birth certificate, Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) forms and passports.
(b)	must include proof of a criminal records check from the county or state where the employee resided for the previous two years (or length of legal residence for foreign nationals in the U.S.
 for less than two years).  
(c)	will be subject to Government verification via the FBI National Crime Information Center (NCIC) Interstate Identification Index (III).  If the background check is selected for  verification, the employee will be required to submit fingerprint records to the FBI Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) database.  NCIC checks and fingerprinting will be performed at
Government expense.

Note: All contractor personnel performing work under this contract requiring access to the military installation shall obtain personal entry and a vehicle pass from the Provost Marshals Office (PMO)  of the Combat Center.  For the MCAGCC/MAGTFTC, this process includes the completion of a COMBAT CENTER ACCESS AUTHORITY letter issued by the Regional Contracting Office (NW).
  

3.  Permanent Business Access:  Required for contractor employees requiring access for periods from one to three years.  Submit all items listed above under business access.  NCIC check and fingerprint of all contractor employees will be conducted at Government expense.  Contractor-provided background checks will be reevaluated annually, and will be updated by the contractor as required at the contractors expense.

4.  Emergency Access:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures which allow the contractor quick access without compromising installation security for situations in which contractor response is crucial in order to preserve and/or restore critical facilities.
  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.  

5.  Installation Access Badges:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures for readily identifying contractor employees working on the installation.  The installation may either provide access badges to individual contractor employees at government expense or it may require the contractor to provide badges to its employees, at its expense.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.  

6.  Denial of Access:  The Commanding General of each installation has broad authority to remove or exclude any person in fulfilling his responsibility to protect personnel and property, to maintain good order and discipline, and to ensure the successful and uninterrupted performance of the Marine Corps mission.
  In the exercise of this authority, the Commanding General may refuse to grant access or may bar contractor employees, including employees who have previously been granted access.  Refusal to grant an employee access or barment of an employee does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue performance under this contract.  Among other reasons, access may be denied if it is determined that an employee:
	a.    is on the National Terrorist watch List.
	b.    is illegally present in the United States.
c.	is subject to an outstanding warrant.
d.	has knowingly submitted an employment questionnaire with false or fraudulent  information.
	e.    has been issued a debarment order and is currently banned from military installations.

7.
  Employee Identification:  Contractor personnel performing work under this contract shall be readily identifiable as an employee of the contractor through the use of uniforms or nametags, or via an alternate method approved by the Contracting Officer. 

8.  Employee Compliance.  The Contractors employees shall observe and comply with all MCAGCC/MAGTFTC rules and regulations applicable to contract personnel, including those applicable to the safe operation of vehicles, and shall not be present in locations not required for the proper performance of this contract. Contractor personnel and equipment entering a military installation are subject to security checks. Contractor personnel shall follow any direction given by military police, law enforcement, or other security or safety personnel.

9.
  Contract Termination:  The Contractor is responsible for ensuring clearances, permits, passes, or security badges are promptly returned to the issuing activity upon termination of an employee, completion of a project, or termination of a contract or subcontract.

<DESC>COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION<br />Winged Floor Pair Trawl Net
<p>(I) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12 and 13 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>(II) This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). Submit written quotes on RFQ Number AB133F-12-RQ-0192/WSB.</p>
<p>(III) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-54.</p>
<p>**(IV) The solicitation is being issued as a Total Small Business Set-Aside.. The associated NAICS code is 114119. The size standards in number in millions of dollars is $4.0M. <br /><br />(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial item(s)/services:</p>
<p>CLIN 0001: Winged Floor Pair Trawl Net made of knotted 11/16-inch mesh with a 100-foot trawl body length as specified in the attached specifications, description and drawing.</p>
<p>CLIN 0002: Shipping and handling of winged floor pair trawl net.</p>
<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF <br />AB133F-12-RQ-0192</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF NEED FOR SUPPLY <br />_____________</p>
<p>PURPOSE:<br />Construct a complete surface pair trawl as described in detail in the attached specification file (provided with the CD-435). This new trawl replaces older trawls of similar design extensively damaged during the near flood conditions of 2011. The trawls are specialty designs used to concentrate and guide migrating juvenile salmonids, included those listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act, through an electronic detection antenna installed in place of a usual cod-end. Detection of passive-integrated-transponder (PIT) tagged juvenile salmon in the Columbia River estuary will allow survival of juvenile salmonids to be partitioned between river and ocean environments and facilitate a more complete understanding of survival and timing differences between transported and in-river-migrant groups. This is a multi-year study that began in 1995 and has continued annually since that time. Through the years a series of replacement trawl nets have been necessary to withstand the rigors of sampling nearly 1,000 h per year. The goal of this project is to partition survival of juvenile salmonids between river and ocean environments and provide survival estimates between transported and in-river out migrating groups. Additional information on travel time, diel migration patterns, and migration behavior in response to flow and water temperature are also be collected by species and compared to similar data collected in the upper estuary from through 2011. Sampling will begin in March and continue through June, with daily effort adjusted commensurate with the numbers of yearling migrants detected. Sampling will continue into the summer months, targeting subyearling migrants. We have one trawl, constructed in 2009, that remains in reasonably sound condition, but our two backup trawl constructed in 2006 and 2007 were well used in previous years and extensively damaged in 2011. A normal use\repair rotation among trawls is necessary to maintain a consistent sample effort required for making survival estimates but at this point we have no reliable backup trawl to our 2009 built trawl thus we are soliciting bids for a replacement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS: <br />Our surface pair-trawl is specialized and no substitution of design or materials can be done without prior approval. The components utilizing 11/16-inch mesh is of particular concern as prior experience with beach and purse-seine nets show that even slightly larger mesh openings can gill and trap fish (the last 100-ft of the trawl wings closest to the antenna, the floor, and the trawl body use 11/16-in webbing). Neither are smaller mesh openings in this area acceptable due to excessive drag. Similarly, the distal 100-foot wing section is constructed of 1.5-inch mesh and we can allow no larger mesh in that section for fear of gilling adult salmon or steelhead. The middle 100-foot wing section is constructed of 1-inch mesh and we would consider substitution of a more readily available intermediate sized mesh (between 1.5-in and 1-inch) to further reduce drag if 1-inch mesh is unavailable.</p>
<p>The general trawl components are described below. However, the detailed specification sheet for the various components is included as a separate attachment and must be followed to ensure correct design and construction.<br />Surface pair-trawl for sampling juvenile salmonids:</p>
<p>Wing-sections (three 100 ft sections of varying mesh sized per each side of trawl). Under tow we maintain about 300-ft between the ends of the wing which concentrate fish in a triangular shape along its length to a fixed frame antenna opening 8.5-ft wide by 10-ft tall about 400-ft downstream.<br />Distal wing (furthest from the antenna) is 1.5-inch stretch measure knotted mesh tapering from 10-ft to 15-ft. 5/8-in diameter cork line (initial 40-ft Spectra and 70' Tennix) with 25, 3.5 lb corks on 48-in centers); Lead lines &frac12;-in diameter Sprectra with 63 lbs lead as per drawing.<br />Middle Wing section is 1-in stretch measure webbing, using 5.8-in dia Tennix cork line (74, 3.5 lb cords on 16-in. centers) and lead line &frac12;-in. Spectra with 63 lbs lead as per drawing. This middle wing section tappers from a 15-ft depth where it joins the previous wing section to 20-ft. where it joins the rear wing section.</p>
<p>Proximal wing (nearest the antenna). This wing is composed of 11/16-in stretch measure knotted webbing (though we would consider knotless webbing if knotted unavailable). This section is square cut to a 20-ft depth and includes a floor attached ahead of the footrope that connects the two wing sections as per drawing. Small triangles of webbing reinforce the corners where this head rope connects the wings. There is approximately 30-ft of head rope and foot rope between the wings at the entrance to the trawl body.</p>
<p>Trawl body. This section is a approximately 100-ft long section of 11/16-in webbing behind the head and foot ropes. Its specific dimensions are listed in the drawing, but essentially is an asymmetric design where the top panel terminates 2-ft beneath the surface and the bottom panel rises (from 20-ft wing depth) to 12 ft beneath the surface (matching the 8.5-ft wide by 10-ft deep antenna suspended on a buoy 2-ft beneath the surface.). The trawl body has debris removal ports closed by industrial strength zippers as shown in the drawings.</p>

<DESC><br><br>This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only; this is not a request for Quotations or Proposals. No solicitation document exists and a formal solicitation may or may not be issued by the Government as a result of the responses to this RFI. The Government will not be liable for payment of any response preparation expenses. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.<br><br>The U.S. Army, Product Manager, Robotic and Unmanned Sensors, Aberdeen Proving Grounds MD (PM RUS) is issuing this RFI relative to aerial sensor payloads with high definition Electro-Optic/Infrared capability in support of forthcoming programs. <br><br>Description of System Capability <br><br>This sensor shall be capable of being integrated into the Manned and Unmanned Aircraft System. The sensor will require an Eye-safe Laser Rangefinder (ELRF), Laser Target Marker (LTM), and Laser Spot Tracker (LST). The ELRF will provide accurate target location and allow a first round fire for effect and will provide the ability to accurately range and designate for precision guided munitions and reporting of target locations. The LTM will provide a capability to quickly cue or conduct target handover to personnel equipped with I2 devices.  The LST provides the ability to acquire and track coded laser energy and provides another means for target handover. <br><br>The Electro Optic/Infrared/Image Intensified/Laser Designator/Laser Rangefinder (EO/IR/I2/LD/LRF) system (MIL STD-810F/G and 461E/F compliant) with High Definition Electro-Optic/Infrared capability (minimum requirement of 720p output resolution) shall provide a battlefield commander with overall mission area support to perform tactical level reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition and attack throughout the full spectrum of Army and Joint operations. The Electro-Optic (EO) sensor will provide high definition imagery during high light conditions in color and be capable of black and white imagery when selected by the operator.  The Image Intensified (I2) sensor will provide imagery during low light conditions in the spectral band between 650-900nm that can be fused with EO/IR imagery when selected by the operator.  An Infra Red (IR) sensor will provide high definition imagery day and night. <br><br>Production Lead Time <br><br>Deliveries of systems shall commence within 12 months of contract award. Qualified vendors shall have an existing product that meets performance requirements. Qualified vendors shall also have sufficient production capacity to meet production quantities as stated. The response must include a short introductory technical description of the proposed system/technologies to be employed and how this approach meets the stated requirements and interface control document. Additional documentation such as formal test results and assessments from a Government test agency, product descriptions, previous performance, may be appended. System information will be technically evaluated and used for system performance with various atmospheres and targets.  Also provide budgetary rough-order of magnitude (ROM) unit pricing, schedule availability information, mean time between system failures as well as mean time between system abort, and any product literature that might be useful in evaluating the system.<br><br>Government Objectives<br><br>The system will be:<br><br>a. A low cost, non-developmental item (NDI) sensor that would be common both for manned and unmanned airborne platforms. <br><br>b.	TRL level 7 as it exists today or a clear path to TRL level 7 within 6 months.<br><br>c.	Allows for a clear path for added capabilities in the near term and new capabilities/technologies in the future.<br><br>The response to this RFI will be used to update the existing acquisition strategy for several aerial sensor programs under PM RUS and maintain these sensors relevance in the context of current and future requirements. This RFI will serve to identify potential sources for the production of the high definition Electro-Optic/Infrared and Image Intensified sensor system with laser designator and laser rangefinder capability suitable for integration onto manned and unmanned platforms. It will also serve to determine industry base experience, state-of-the-art technology and manufacturing capability that is currently available or available within the next six months. <br><br>1. System information may be technically evaluated and used for M&S system performance with various atmospheres and targets.  Also provide budgetary rough-order of magnitude (ROM) unit pricing, schedule availability information, mean time between system failures as well as mean time between system abort, and any product literature that might be useful in evaluating the system. <br><br>2. Sources are requested to provide general system information, along with the required optical Modeling and Simulation (M&S) information to include input files (in *.txt format) if available for the following M&S programs: NVTHERMIP, IICAMIP, SSCAMIP, IINVD, NVLRG, and/or NVLASERD.  If input files are not available, please complete the attached specifications sheets for each applicable product.<br><br>3. Please highlight video output formats, laser wavelengths & capabilities, inertial measurement unit to gimbal accuracy errors, command and control protocols, and SWaP.  This information will be used to ensure that accurate representations are made regarding specific systems.  Systems will be evaluated against the current and future operational requirements of the Department of Defense and homeland security. <br><br>Recommended RFI Response Format<br>All materials submitted in response to this RFI must be unclassified. Interested parties possessing the capacity to deliver products meeting the objectives outlined above are requested to provide a White Paper in electronic format describing the approach to produce, manage and meet the production/performance objectives established above and should address the following items:<br><br>1.

This non-competitive action is being issued by the Federal Correctional Complex, Butner, NC.

These services will be for the period of January 1, 2012 through January 31, 2012. The Government believes that Duke University Medical Center is the only hospital that will satisfy the agency requirement for inmates referred for inpatient and outpatient physician and facility care when care is not otherwise available from the contract provider. The NAICS code is 622110. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, as no solicitation document is available. However any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give a written or fax notification to the Contracting Officer within five (5) calendar days from the date of this published synopsis. Supporting is not a request for competitive quotes. This is sole source procurement under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition (FAR 6.302-1). The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Responses will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received FCC Butner will proceed with sole source negotiated with Duke University Health Systems, Duke University Medical Center.

<p>Due to unanticipated acquisition process delays, it has become necessary to modify existing contract SP3300-11-C-1012 to allow for uninterrupted industrial hygiene services through July 31 2012. Pursuant to the exception under FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), only Corky Hull Associates is capable of providing the services at this time; award to any other source will result in unacceptable delays and cause a disruption to San Joaquin activities. The modification to current contract SP3100-07-C-0019 will serve as a temporary solution to fulfill immediate mission requirements.</p>

<DESC>The Navy has reexamined the requirements contemplated under N00024-11-R-5304 and has determined the planned solicitation no longer reflects the present needs of the Navy.   Given this determination, it is appropriate and in the best interest of the Navy to not release a solicitation for this effort at this time.

The Navy is presently reviewing an alternate method to meeting this capability in the short term. 

Please note the cancellation of this effort does not affect the ongoing AMDR-S Technology Demonstration phase or future AMDR suite S-band requirements.

The Navy appreciates the submitted notifications of interest and looks forward to continued participation of Industry in future efforts to strengthen the capability of the United States Navy.

<DESC>The attached synopsis is for Mississippi River Channel Dredging with a Hydraulic Pipeline Dustpan Dredge and Attendant Plant. The work consists of furnishing, delivering, and operating one fully operated hydraulic pipeline dustpan dredge and attendant plant for the removal and satisfactory disposal of shoal material. The primary dredging region will be any point on the Mississippi River between Cairo, Illinois (Mile 953.8 AHP) and New Orleans, LA. (Mile 106 AHP). Dredging may be required at secondary locations between Cubit's Gap (Mile 4.0 AHP) and Southwest Bar Channel (Mile 22.0 BHP); and tributaries of the Mississippi River. Only one contract will be awarded from this solicitation. Award will be made on the basis of the offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 9, whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements, and is judged to represent the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price. The contract will consist of one year to construct or prepare a dredge, one base year, plus three option periods not to exceed 12 months for each period. Each option will be one year in length. Total length of contract including one year to prepare a dredge will not exceed five (5) years if base and all three options are exercised. If construction of prepared dredge is completed within one year, upon mutual agreement between the Contractor and the Government, notice to proceed with dredging assignments may be issued within the first 12 months of the contract. Any work performed during the initial 12 months will be paid for at the applicable contract prices of Base Year (12 Months) of Section 00010. The base and all options will be added together to form one total price. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the options. The value of the proposed work for the base and all options is Not-To-Exceed (NTE) $48,000,000.00. No payment will be made for the construction or modification of an existing hydraulic dredge.

<DESC>RECOVERY: THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This notice represents award of a modification to the existing contractor Noridian Administrative Services under the current contract number HHSM-500-2006-M0005Z in the amount of $8,000 authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS.
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology. Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals. <br /><br />The purpose of this modification is to fund the contractor to collect and subsequently enter necessary data into the HITECH FISS screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals by March 31, 2011. This data shall be obtained from the latest filed 12-month cost report. As later cost reports are accepted during the year, MACs shall update the data in FISS within 5 business days of acceptance of the cost report (for those hospitals that have not yet attested and received their initial payment). <br /><br />This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</p>

<DESC>The Tri-Service Automated Cost Engineering Systems (TRACES) Cost Book and Area Cost Factors databases. The TRACES Cost Book currently has approximately 69,000 task items and is updated every two years and the Area Cost Factors are updated every year. Area Cost Factors (both CONUS and OCONUS) are used by the Department of Defense for calculating the cost of general construction at a specific military installation as compared to a "National Average". The database will support several DOD automated information systems. These services will be acquired using North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541513 (Computer Facilities Management Services). The IDIQ contract will have a capacity not-to-exceed $5.6 Million over a one-year base and 3 one-year option periods. Since these services are commercial, the simplified acquisition procures of FAR 13.5 will be used for solicitation and award. The successful contractor shall provide a commercial off-the-shelf, readily available cost book in electronic format which is maintained and updated on a regular basis. The Cost Book must be an item that is readily available for purchase by the general public and includes material cost, labor items, equipment items, crew makeup and productivity. This item may be somewhat customized at the user's request. This level of customization for the customer is considered standard within the cost book industry. Additionally, the contractor will perform market research to provide additional cost information, such as material prices on government maintained tasks, as requested. In addition, this Cost Book Support contract includes provisions for updating the Area Cost Factors. A yearly survey is performed to update the database used by the Area Cost Factors software application. The following items may also be required by the contractor as a part of this acquisition: telephone hotline support, other economic surveys, electronic database distribution, technical documentation preparation, database management, other commercially available data such as, but not limited to, assembly and square foot cost data, life cycle cost data, etc.<br>

<p>OSI PI Annual Software Reliance Program Renewal</p>
<p>Proposal Disallowed Reason:</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, all interest and capability statements must be received by the Government no later than 12 Dec 2011, at 9:00 AM PDST to be considered.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy, Western Area Power Administration (WAPA), Sierra-Nevada Regional Office (SNR), intends to award a sole-source award for OSI PI Annual Software Reliance Program Renewal Services. Authority for other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The resulting procurement will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 12. This is a vendor specific requirement to provide support for the software support.</p>
<p>The resulting award will be fixed price. Only OSI has the unique, proprietary knowledge of the support needed by WAPA. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, all interest and capability statements must be received by the Government no later than 12 DEC 2011, at 9:00 AM PDST to be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 511210; Size Standard is $25.0M. Questions concerning this sole-source procurement may be directed to Jason Krupp at krupp@wapa.gov. No solicitation will be posted.</p>
<p>Sole Source Justification Information:</p>
<p>1. Identification of the Program Office. <br />The Western Area Power Administration (WAPA), Sierra Nevada Region (SNR), of the Department of Energy (DOE).</p>
<p>2. Description of supply or service required to meet the agency's needs.</p>
<p>OSI PI Enterprise Server and PI ICCP Interface (Software): This software is used by WAPA to record data for historical and reporting purposes. This software is WAPA's current standard in data storage and is used for both the operations side and the business side of house. The software is listed as a critical system for successfully running the WAPA sub-control area.</p>
<p>3. The rationale or circumstances for limiting competition.</p>
<p>Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The existence of limited rights in data, patent rights, copyrights, or secret processes; the control of basic raw material; or similar circumstances, make the supplies and services available from only one source.</p>
<p>OSI, the maker of the PI software, has the unique knowledge of the PI software to be able to support it to level of detail needed by WAPA. This is and will continue to be a mission critical application and the support for this software needs to accurate and unfailing in its job. There are currently no other vendors, that allow another company, other than OSI, to provide support for their software in a level that is needed by WAPA.</p>
