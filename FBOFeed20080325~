All documents and records (including photographs) generated during the performance of work under this contract shall be for the sole use and become the exclusive property of the U.S Government. Furthermore, no article, book, pamphlet, email, recording, broadcast, speech television appearance, film or photograph concerning any aspect of work performed under this contract shall be published or disseminated through any media without the prior written authorization of the Contracting Officer. These obligations do no cease upon the expiration or termination of this contract.  The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>In support of the Department of State the approval of Brand Name supplies that affects the enterprise and management compatibility are justified as follows: Agency: The requesting office is the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Information Resource Management (IRM) AntiVirus (AV) Program.  Symantec Endpoint Protections / Symantec AntiVirus Corporate Edition (SEP/SAVCE) provide desktop protection against malicious code in the form of viruses, Trojan Horses and Mass Mailers that arrive at Department of State systems in several ways. Including email, browsing the Internet, removable media and security flaws in the operating system to name a few.  Protection against these threats is a continuing concern for the Department of State.  The SEP/SAVCE product and its predecessors (NAV and NAVCE) have been in use at the Department of State for many years providing proven protection.  No other product on the market has this track record.	 Symantec Corporation works with the State Department on AntiVirus initiatives to protect Department of State desktop systems. The technical support staff at Symantec is familiar with the installed systems and the level of support and service we require. No other AntiVirus company has this level of experience with Department of State systems.	 Common Engine Technology - Because of the common engine technology all tiers, platforms and languages all use the same virus definitions. Other vendors have multiple downloads for different tiers, languages and platforms.  Common Agent Technology ý SEP introduces a single agent that functions for enhanced AntiVirus and Antispyware features that were in SAVCE as well as additional features that include a Firewall, Intrusion Prevention, Device Control, Application Control and Network Access Control (NAC). Submission of virus samples via HTTPS:  Other vendors require the use of email as the submission process. This is important because in the event that the Email system is shutdown for any reason we can still submit virus samples via HTTPS.  The latest version of SEP/SAVCE has a 50% reduction in the Client footprint and uses micro definitions that reduce the amount of network traffic in passing definitions.  SEP/SAVCE can be configured to either push or pull definitions, making updates at any level possible. SEP has the ability to update from a client established as a Group Update Provider (GUP). The GUP reduces the need for deployment of servers to support clients.  With SEP true central management is possible allowing configuration of all clients from a single management interface. The Virus Incident Response Team (VIRT) conducts continuing market reviews to ensure Department of State systems have current state of the art protection against malicious code. The VIRT keeps abreast of new products and changes in existing products. Providing the best protection available is a core part of the VIRT mission. To this end the VIRT staff reviews magazine articles, independent reviews and Internet resources related to AntiVirus products.<BR><BR>The AntiVirus program at the Department of State has enjoyed a great deal of success in preventing and eradicating viral attacks. This is in large part due to the AntiVirus products installed. The multi-vendor approach used by the Department has allowed Department of State systems to remain functional and online even when most other government agencies have been shutdown. SAVCE has played a key role is making this possible. Altering such a key component could put Department of State systems at risk.   No software is bug free and any new software introduced in to Department of State networks must be tested to ensure compatibility with existing systems.  Experience has shown that do to the nature of AntiVirus software this is especially true for these products.  In house programs have been developed on systems running SAVCE. Introducing a new AntiVirus solution would produce unpredictable results. Possibly causing loss of data and man-hours.  The VIRT developed installation guidelines and procedures for SAVCE unique to the Department of State. The VIRT and Enterprise Network Management (ENM) thoroughly tested SAVCE in a lab environment. Issues unique to the Department of State were addressed and resolved. The Department of State Configuration Control Board (CCB) reviewed these results, the product of many thousands of man-hours, and SAVCE was added to the Software Baseline. The forthcoming deployment of SEP meets critical security requirements for workstations to include a firewall and intrusion prevention technology. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorýs unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the most cost effective means to meet the production requirements. The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid. The 41 USC 253(c) (1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited as the statutory authority. All bids will be provided from GSA approved vendors.  It is anticipated the final award will be to the entity providing the best competitive price through the FedBid process.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) plans to make awards that represent the best value to the Government in accordance with the evaluation criteria. ONR is seeking participants for this program who are capable of investigating and applying advances in S&T by designing, developing, and demonstrating the concepts required to achieve the goals described in this announcement. Offerors have the opportunity to be creative in the selection of the technical and management processes, either commercial or DoD practices, that best suit their approach.

Awards are anticipated to be between $0.2M and $7M. The total estimated budget for this BAA program is seven (7) million dollars over five years.  The Navy reserves the right to select for funding all, some or none of the responses received.  Awards will take the form of contracts. ONR will not issue grants, cooperative agreements, or other transaction agreements under this BAA.

Under the Office of Naval Research (ONR) Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Program, ONR is investing in technologies that have the potential to improve the erosion resistance of the leading edge of main rotor blades of Naval/Marine Corps helicopters. It is the intent of this BAA to leverage these investments to investigate and demonstrate new technologies capable of improving erosion resistance and the resultant life of the rotor blades, thereby increasing on-wing time/reliability, reducing maintenance man-hours, fuel consumption, and improving power conversion efficiency of Navy and Marine Corps helicopters.  Proposals submitted in response to this BAA should include, but are not limited to, the analysis, development, risk reduction and demonstration of technologies capable of developing materials that: (1) increase the on-wing time of the rotor blades to 12,000 flight hours from the effects of sand and/or rain erosion, and are (2) conducive to cost-effective reparability of blades, and to a lesser extent, reduce corrosion, improve power generation conversion efficiency, and reduce fuel consumption, though the latter need not be a requirement.

<DESC>This project is an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Design/Build Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) at Andersen AFB, Guam and Hickam AFB, Hawaii.  The MACC is a contract for execution of a broad range of maintenance, repair and minor construction and may include design.     Contractors will be expected to accomplish a wide variety of individual construction tasks, including, but not limited to, design/build, renovation, additions/upgrades, along with specific work in Heating/Ventilation/Air Conditioning, electrical, mechanical and other major trades.  Description of the work will be identified in each individual task order.  

Individual task orders may be as low as $400,000, or may be well in excess of $5,000,000, however most task orders will fall in the range of $500,000 to $1,000,000.  The program value is Not-to-Exceed $160,000,000 over a five-year period.  Andersen AFB, GU will be allocated $100,000,000 over the life of the contract, while Hickam AFB, HI will be allocated $60,000,000.  Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month period and four 12-month option periods.   The government anticipates awarding between 8-12 contracts to service Hickam AFB, Hawaii and Andersen AFB, Guam, with 5-7 contracts allocated to Hickam AFB, HI and 3-5 contracts allocated to Andersen AFB, GU.  Qualified contractors who receive a contract in the Hickam MACC may also be considered for award in the Andersen MACC and vice versa.  Contractors will be required to designate their interest in projects located at only Hickam AFB or Andersen AFB, or both bases.  Declinations of interest in one of the other locations will not adversely affect your ability to participate in these acquisitions.  No preference will be given to Contractors who submit proposals for both bases.    

The government will evaluate offers and select the awardees utilizing the best value source selection procedures described in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR Part 15.3) and Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS 5315.3).  In using this best value approach, the government seeks to award to those offerors who give the Air Force the greatest confidence they will best meet our requirements affordably.  While the government source selection evaluation team and the source selection authority will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective.  This may result in an award being made to higher rated, higher priced offerors where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors in the RFP and the selection authority reasonably determines that the technical superiority, and/or overall business approach, and/or superior past performance, of higher priced offerors outweighs the cost difference. The RFP will identify separate seed projects for Andersen AFB, GU and Hickam AFB, HI.  Award of the seed projects will satisfy the guaranteed minimum for the first contract awarded.  All other successful awardees are guaranteed a minimum of $2,500.  The government will compete future individual requirements among the awardees.  This acquisition is being considered for 8(a) set-aside, tiered evaluation, unrestricted competition, or a combination of these.  

An actual solicitation is expected to be issued on or about 7 April 2008.  The closing date and time for submission of offers will be contained in the solicitation package.  The entire solicitation, including MACC General Provision and a seed project package, will be made available only on Electronic Posting System (EPS) single government point of entry (GPE) Web Site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov at that time.  Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation package and any other pertinent information and for downloading their own copy of the solicitation package.  Potential offerors MUST register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov in order to receive notification and/or changes to the solicitation.  All contractors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database or their proposal will not be considered. Contractors can obtain further information on the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at web site http://www.ccr.gov.       

This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or multiple contracts nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any bid/proposal preparation costs. 

A pre-bid/pre-proposal conference will be conducted at Hickam AFB, HI, on/around 15 April 2008, and at Andersen AFB, GU, on/around 17 April 2008, for the purpose of explaining the concepts involved with the project and answering questions regarding the project and solicitation.

This procurement is to extend Contract NAS5-03079 for a period of up to 6-months from April 28, 2008 through October 27, 2008 and increase the maximum ordering value in order to allow sufficient time to award the follow-on procurement.	This extension will allow for a continuation of current delivery orders issued, for modifications to existing delivery orders, and for new work until the Program Analysis and Control (PAAC III) competitive follow-on contract is awarded.

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for heated jet and heated helium experiments for simulation of launch abort system exhaust plumes with downstream surfaces (Phase 3) - with shock noise effects and heated helium plume tests.  NASA/ARC intends to purchase the items from Sustainable Technology, LLC of Tallahassee, FL 32309-3244 under the authority of FAR Part 13.106-1(b), for the acquisition of services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  The contractor's hot jet test facility is the only facilty that has the jet flow rate and heating capacity, spatial range, model positioning and data measurement system that are required to perform this work.  This task is a follow-on to two previous purchase orders issued by NASA Ames Research Center to Sustainable Technnology wherein the contractor has acquired an extensive base of flow measurements (velocity, temperature, noise field) for the specific jet conditions required for this study.  It is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. The objectives of this work include the following: 1.  Extend the findings from the Phase 1 and 2 heated jet experiments to include the effects of shock noise.  This will be accomplished by acquiring pressure fluctuation data for a simulated Crew Exploration Vehicle surface exposed to hot, warm and cold exhaust plumes at the spatial regions examined in the Phase 2 study. 2.  Acquire flow field and near-field acoustic data for a heated helium jet operating at conditions that simulate previously obtained heated jet conditions.  Flow field data will be obtained for specific heated plumes that were examined in Phase 2. 3.  Determine the proper acoustic scaling, if any, for using helium as a substitute for a high temperature supersonic jet. The contractor shall perform the following: 1.  Set up the model experiment in the contractor-provided hot jet aeroacoustic facility to measure unsteady surface pressures on Government-provided models equipped with Government-provided unsteady pressure transducers, to document shock-associated noise and the effects of helium gas on near-plume noise levels and spectra. 2.  Mount the model on the contractor's model positioning system and acquire data while operating the contractor's hot jet facility at a predetermined set of flow conditions and positioning the model at a predetermined set of positions and orientations. 3.  Provide measurements of data including unsteady surface pressure signals, thermal sensors, jet conditions of temperature and flow rate, near-field microphone levels and jet flow plume total pressure. 4.  The contractor shall provide all data in tabular/graphical format, including flow data from previous studies where applicable, to document flow conditions and characteristics. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. Pacific time on April 9, 2008.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for the Scaling Relationships Study for Large Propellant Tanks NASA intends to purchase this service from Dr. Franklin T. Dodge at the Southwest Research Institute of San Antonio, Texas. SOW for the Scaling Relationships Study for Large Propellant Tanks. Introduction- NASA is currently developing the propulsion system concepts for exploration missions including a near term human return to the lunar surface. The propulsion concept defined in the NASA Exploration System Architecture Study (ESAS) considered the use of cryogenic propellants ? liquid oxygen (LO2), liquid methane (LCH4) and/or liquid hydrogen (LH2) for the low gravity portion of the mission. These exploration propulsion system concepts included a large LO2/LH2 pump fed propulsion second stage capable of LEO orbit insertion of a lunar surface payload, of LEO loiter and of a LEO engine restart for the trans-lunar injection of a crewed capsule, service module and the lunar surface payload required for lunar exploration missions. The LH2 propellant storage tank of this large propulsion stage is cylindrical and has been estimated to be 10 m (~30 feet) in diameter, 10 meters (30 feet) long, and to have an approximate volume of 620 m3 (22,000 ft3). The LO2 propellant storage tank is ellipsoidal and has been estimated to be 8 m (~24 feet) in diameter, approximately 6 m (18 feet) long and to have an estimated volume of 190 m3 (6,700 ft3).This stage is comparable in size to the Saturn V S-II stage (~ 9 m in diameter); however, the S-II did not have an orbital engine restart requirement, i.e., was a single burn. The S-IVB stage was about 20 ft in diameter and the engine was re-started after a LEO coast period of up to 4.5 hours. Similarly, the 10 ft. diameter Centaur upper stages have restarted after orbital coast periods of up to 9 hours. Thus an earth departure stage will be the largest stage with an orbital engine restart requirement after extended coast periods in low earth orbit (LEO) of up to 14 days. Cryogenic fluid management subsystems will be required to control the propellant tank pressure and assure that the tank pressure and bulk fluid temperatures support the propulsion system engine start box after the pre-pressurization sequence in preparation for engine restart. The current method for tank pressure control during orbital coast periods is to position the tank fluid with a settling thrust provided by a separate ancillary propulsion system then venting the ullage. Tank venting and pressure control can be accomplished without propellant settling by using a thermodynamic vent system (TVS). De-stratification of the bulk fluid temperature can be accomplished with a mixer and the thermal energy removed through utilization of Joule-Thomson refrigeration techniques. Although a cryogenic TVS has not been demonstrated in low-gravity, extensive testing of TVS?s has been accomplished in normal gravity. All of the previous experimentation with fluid mixing and TVS pressure control systems has been with very small tanks using simulant fluids in drop tower tests or with tank volumes of less than 1000 cubic feet using liquid hydrogen (LH2) or liquid nitrogen (LN2) in a 1-g environment. Objective- The objective of this study is to  1.	Determine the risk to NASA with extrapolating results from prior ground tests of fluid mixer and TVS pressure control components to the proposed large propellant tanks of an earth departure stage. 2.	Provide NASA an understanding of the need of near full scale tests to verify the performance of the fluid mixers and TVS pressure control systems required for an earth departure stage of the size under consideration. Task Description- 1.)	Determine the thermodynamic transient response scaling relationships for both LH2 and LO2 for mixer size and power, and destratification time to eliminate fluid stratification in a LEO loiter. ?	Using the developed scaling relationships and existing, reported NASA and contractor 1-g LH2 and LO2 (LN2) stratification test data predict the mixer size and power, and destratification time for an earth departure stage to eliminate fluid stratification for a 50 % fill level in LEO loiter. ?	NASA ground test data are available for the following tank volumes: 18 m3 (639 ft3); MSFC ? MHTB and 5 m3 (175 ft3); GRC ? K-Site. 2.)	Determine the thermodynamic transient response scaling relationships for both LH2 and LO2 for sizing a TVS heat exchanger and its J-T valve, and for determining the fluid losses required to maintain the tank pressure within +/-  10 % of the propellant tank operating pressure (&lt; 138 kPa (20 psia)) for tank fill levels from 50 to 100% in LEO loiter ?	Using the developed scaling relationships and existing, reported NASA and contractor 1-g LH2 and LO2 (LN2) TVS test data predict the resultant size of the TVS heat exchanger and its J-T valve, and the fluid losses required to maintain an earth departure stage tank pressure within +/- 17 kPa (2.5 psi)  for a 50% tank fill level in LEO loiter ?	NASA ground test data are available for the following tank volumes: 18 m3 (639 ft3); MSFC ? MHTB, 5 m3 (175 ft3); GRC ? K-Site, and 2 m3 (71 ft3); MSFC ? STUSTD 3.) Establish a qualitative value of the confidence level to use the scaled one-g data, combined with available flight data and CFD modeling results, to predict an earth departure stage low-g behavior.  Study Assumptions- ? Tank geometry:  ?	LH2 is cylindrical with sq. root of 2 ellipsoidal domes; approximately 10 m diameter and 10 m long with an approximate volume of 620 m3. ?	LO2 is ellipsoidal; approximately 8 m diameter and 6 m long with an approximate volume of 190 m3. ? Tank heat leak ranges: ?	LH2 from 185 to 200 watts ?	LO2 from 110 to 130 watts 	? Nominal tank pressure during orbital coast is 138 kPa (20 psia) 	? Approximate tank conditions required to support engine restart: ?	LH2 -  138 kPa (20 psia) at 20 K (37 &#61616;R) ?	LO2 -  138 kPa (20 psia) at 91 K (164 &#61616;R) 	? Both axial jet and spray bar mixer systems are to be considered 	? Assume acceleration environment of 10-6 g?s due to aerodynamic drag during	  	LEO coast periods Deliverable- Final report of the three tasks described in the Task Description section above. Period of Performance- A draft version of the final report as denoted in the Deliverable section must be submitted for NASA GRC review three months after contract award. The final version of the report must be submitted one month after the completion of the NASA GRC review. The NASA GRC review will not exceed two weeks. The study key personnel shall participate via telecom during the NASA GRC review.  Presently a concept for an earth departure stage requires that it be the largest propulsion stage ever developed with an orbital engine restart requirement after extended coast periods in low earth orbit (LEO). This large size presents a challenge to the NASA Cryogenic Fluid Management (CFM) community to validate the tank pressure control systems using existing but substantially smaller scale ground test hardware and test facilities.  It is recommended that this study be performed by Dr. Franklin T. Dodge, a Senior Technical Advisor of the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI). SwRI is an independent, non-profit research institution located in San Antonio, Texas. Rational- Dr. Dodge is the most qualified individual to perform this study because he is recognized by his peers in academia, industry and NASA as both a national and international expert in the field of cryogenic fluid management for low gravity applications. He has spent over 43 years in this field, authored over 100 publications, has been the Principal Investigator for a successfully flown low gravity flight experiment, holds several patents in this field and has consulted as a Co-Investigator for over six flight experiments. He is an expert in the field of fluid thermodynamic behavior in low gravity, is knowledgeable in the use of thermodynamic vent systems to control propellant tank pressures in low gravity and has acted as a consultant on several proposed NASA cryogenic fluid flight experiments in the 1990?s. Although currently retired from SwRI, Dr. Dodge maintains an office at the SwRI San Antonio campus and has availability to all the SwRI resources. Recommendation- It is recommended that this study be performed by Dr. Franklin T. Dodge, a Senior Technical Advisor of the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI). SwRI is an independent, non-profit research institution located in San Antonio, Texas. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on or before 4/1/08 to: ( NASA Glenn Research Center, Attn: Dennis D.Pehotsky, 21000 Brookpark Rd., MS 500-319, Cleveland, OH 44135.)

The JSC Education Office has a single project manager for TFS activities.  EAP/EFP and other TFS activities offer NASA Education unique capabilities and opportunities to involve educators and students through astronaut training, spaceflight missions, on-orbit education activities, future flight platforms and space missions, and a variety of education flight projects.   All TFS activities are designed to support an integrated vision and objectives.  The vision for TFS is: Facilitate education opportunities that use the unique environment of spaceflight and other flight platforms.   TFS will focus its efforts to meet three objectives: 1.	Develop and provide NASA-unique experiences, opportunities, content, and resources to educators and students to increase K-12 student interest in STEM disciplines. 2.	Develop and facilitate a NEAT-like (Network of Educator Astronaut Teachers) group of highly motivated educators.  3.	Build internal and external partnerships with formal and informal education communities to create unique learning opportunities and professional development experiences. Institutions eligible to respond to this CAN are limited to higher education institutions, nonprofit organizations, or consortia of organizations and institutions serving higher education.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Office of Atmospheric Programs (OAP), Climate Change Division (CCD), Climate Economics Branch (CEB) intends to award a sole source fixed price contract under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, to Texas A&M University (TAMU) for continuing support a key economic modeling tool for analyzing projected U.S. forest and agricultural Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and carbon sequestration and the economic potential of GHG mitigation in these sectors. CCD uses this work to build effective domestic and international capacity to analyze and reduce GSG emissions and associated air pollution. A full Statement of Work is available on the EPA OAM website: http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/admin_placement/0811454/index.htm. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.  It has been determined that the staff at TAMU are uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's requirement, as they have initiated and led model development in this area for nearly two decades, which has resulted in the current Forestry and Agriculture Optimization Model + Greenhouse Gases (FASOM-GHG) model. The expertise of the TAMU staff in the economic modeling of agricultural and forestry is internationally recognized; and the FASOM-GHG model is considered unique and unsurpassed for modeling domestic land competition between agriculture and forestry -- a complex and essential factor for evaluating the land implications of policies.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a capability statement, which if received within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date of this announcement will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing and provide clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. A determination not to compete the proposed contract based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Sharron K. Doherty via the e-mail link below.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to issue a sole-source purchase order  to Warwick Technology Limited, in Warwick United Kingdom for $47,000.00.    The Contractor shall provide two (2) Dynamic Breathing Machine use for the development of test protocol for Respirator and surgical mask efficacy from cough aerosols.  A comparable need for non-conventional breathing waveform generation was identified in a previous project.  The Warwick dynamic breathing machine was identified at that time as the only commercially available device capable of meeting the requirement (high displacement and frequency).  Unlike conventional breathing machines, the Warwick breathing machines determine respiration waveform via digital programming (software).  As a result the waveform and its frequency can be changed instantaneously over the full range of the device without disassembly of the machine.  Waveforms can be reproduce accurately and repeatedly in the laboratory on the Warwick machine.  It also is capable of producing non-periodic and non-symmetrical waveforms as is required for simulating coughs. Warwick breathing machine meets all technical specifications.

<SUBJECT>B --  AIM: Assessing the Adaptation and Implementation of Mpowerment
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-HCVJB2X3-2008-51060
<RESPDATE>041508
<ARCHDATE>04302008

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE:  The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is contemplating the award of a contract on a Sole Source basis to the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), Center for AIDS Prevention Studies (CAPS), in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 and HHSAR 306.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.  The basis for this contemplation is that only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements.   

Currently, CDC funded under Program Announcement (PA) 06-618 twelve Community Based Organizations (CBOs) to implement and adapt the community level HIV prevention intervention, Mpowerment.  Applicants were informed that agencies chosen for funding would receive intervention materials, training, and ongoing technical assistance related to the project for which they were funded to target minority populations of YMSM.

The Mpowerment intervention was developed by CAPS to be delivered as a community-level intervention.  Thus, in this sole-source contract, a community-level intervention intended to prevent HIV transmission among YMSM in the target minority populations.  This will target effectively the programmatic objectives of PA06-618.  

The purpose of this contract is to procure the services and technical expertise from the only qualified contractor who will partner with CDC to review and summarize existing data, to provide training and technical assistance on Mpowerment to directly-funded CBOs who are awarded funds to implement this intervention through PA06-618.  

The Mpowerment intervention materials are proprietary data (Copyright(c)2002 Center for AIDS Prevention Studies).  These proprietary materials will be further refined and provided by UCSF CAPS to be used by CBOs funded to implement the Mpowerment intervention in minority populations of YMSM.  Therefore CDC believes that UCSF CAPS is the only resource that has this unique program.  The anticipated performance period is for 15 months.  It is believed that UCSF CAPS possesses the capability and is uniquely qualified to perform this requirement as stated above.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Interested parties who believe they possess the capabilities to satisfy this requirement should submit a capability statement demonstrating their abilities to meet this requirement.  All responses should be received by April 15, 2008, at 4 PM, Eastern Standard Time (EST).  All responses must be in writing and can be sent via email to bbv9@cdc.gov or fax to 404-639-8095.  No telephone calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Pathology plans to procure on a sole source basis; one fluorescent vertical microscope and accessories with Nikon Instruments Inc., 514 Progress Dr., Suite T, Linthicum, MD 21090. 

This acquisition will be processed using simplified acquisition procedures as authorized under FAR Part 13.106 (b)(1).  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.

Fluorescent microscope analysis provides sensitive measurements of protein expression at single cell level. Therefore highly controlled experiments are possible with the resolving power to develop biologically important drugs for lung cancer.  Fluorescent microscopy, is both quantitative and objective, thus reducing bias in experimental evaluation.  The availability of a modern vertical fluorescent microscope with hardware capable of  interfacing with new and sophisticated software will greatly expand the range of possible experiments and will facilitate and expedite by a large measure experiments that can now be conducted only with difficulty. 

The following salient characteristics apply:
- C-SRR Rectangular Rotatable Stage RH Fixed (Bb)
- Y-TT Trinocular Eyepiece Tube T 2
- C-LHGF I HG Lamp (Required for both versions)
- CC Slide Achro Condensor 2-100X
- C-HGF 1B HG Adaptor B (for i-series)
- DS-Qi1f1.4-Megapixel 2/3" CCD Cooled Monochrome Quantitative Camera Head
-DS-U2 Camera Control Unit via USB 2.0 With Elements "F" Capture Software. (Requires MQ52050 AC Adapter, MQF11000 Connecting Cable, Camera head, USB A/B Cable 97050)
- AC Adaptor DS-L2 & DS-U2
- USB 2.0 Cable A-B 15ft Required for DS-U2 Controller
- NIS-Elements: Basic Research: Acquisition and analysis Package, includes camera and Nikon motorized microscope drivers.

 
Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition:

1.	Statutory authority: Statute: 13.106-1(b)

(b) Soliciting from a single source.

(1)	For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).  

Benefit:  

The Lung Cancer Section in the MOB, CCR,  NCI is charged with developing of targeted therapeutics for lung cancer.  Lung Cancer contributes to deaths of an estimated 150,000 Americans each year.  Therefore, it is clearly of benefit to the Section, the NCI and the NIH, and hence to the government, to facilitate studies that will enable discovery of treatment and prevention of lung cancer. Fluorescent microscopy is the premier and best way to measure molecules at the level of single cells.  Such measurements of EGFR and apoptotic proteins obtained through the utilization of the instrument herein requested will provide information about the molecular processes regulating cancer growth that would be completely unobtainable otherwise.  Thus purchase and operation of this instrument therefore will advance the governmental mission of the Lung Cancer Section, MOB, CCR, NCI to promote the health and well-being of all Americans.


	Justification:

The Nikon Fluorescent microscope is the only instrument with the required and essential capabilities that is also easily upgradeable should the results of current experiments dictate that additional lasers are added to expand the spectral capabilities of the device.  In addition, it is interchangeable with existing the Nikon inverted microscope, thus certain parts and software will be use in common. 


This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 1:00 PM ET on April 8, 2008.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist at marinome@mail.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference NCI-80056-MM on all correspondence.

All documents and records (including photographs) generated during the performance of work under this contract shall be for the sole use and become the exclusive property of the U.S Government. Furthermore, no article, book, pamphlet, email, recording, broadcast, speech television appearance, film or photograph concerning any aspect of work performed under this contract shall be published or disseminated through any media without the prior written authorization of the Contracting Officer. These obligations do no cease upon the expiration or termination of this contract.  The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>As the Contracts Officer Representative (COR) for the Oracle/PeopleSoft software products used in the Department of Stateýs Integrated Logistics Management System (ILMS), I recommend the use of other than full and open competition for the purpose of purchasing software support for its continued maintenance.  The Department owns perpetual software licenses for the products -- however software support is a separate expense and represents an ongoing annual expenditure.  The action to be approved is the order for Peoplesoft software support obtained through the Federal Supply Schedule contract with the most qualified provider. PeopleSoft products are the basis for much of ILMS.  The PeopleSoft products currently used by ILMS include: PeopleSoft Inventory, PO, CRM Support server license, Object Studio,  Balanced Scorecard,  Enterprise Warehouse,  Supply Chain Management,  Activity Based Management,  GL, and AM modules A full description of the software support services required for this purchase can be found on the GSA Federal Supply Schedule for the selected provider. The authority for sole source orders under GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts is Section 201 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 501). Due to the proprietary nature of the PeopleSoft software, the required software support is available only from a firm that is certified to resell Peoplesoft software support.  This software support is crucial for continued utilization of the software in ILMS.<BR><BR>ILMS is the State Department's comprehensive supply chain management system.  ILMS has been developed over a five-year period at a cost of over $70,000,000.  ILMS is composed of an assortment of customized off-the-shelf software products as well as certain purpose-built software modules that have been linked and integrated with one another, and with the State Department's Financial Management System.  In the course of design and development of ILMS for the State Department, the systems integrator selected and incorporated into ILMS the products and support services provided by PeopleSoft USA, Inc.  ILMS will not function without these components. Although it would theoretically be possible to purchase and customize software that could replace the PeopleSoft software currently used by ILMS, integrate the new software with the rest of the ILMS software modules, and retrain the existing user base -- such an effort would be time consuming, prohibitively costly and would not shield the Department from an identical need for ongoing expenditures for maintenance and support.  Moreover, a decision not to proceed to procure support from would have a significant adverse impact, placing at risk the majority of the software that makes up ILMS. Upon review of possible sources, a vendor will be chosen for software support for Oracle/PeopleSoft legacy software products.   Since the services for the same software support were obtained last year, the universe of vendors has remained the same.   These support services are necessary to maintain the existing production version of ILMS.  The need to have PeopleSoft's technical support for the PeopleSoft software cannot be restated in a way that would permit the use of other commercial or non-developmental items. In the course of the development of ILMS, the Government made a serious effort to assure that Accenture, as the prime contractor, obtained as much competition as possible in subcontracting components of the task -- such as the software licenses and support contracts that it executed. To date, no sources have written to express an interest in this acquisition. When the Government assumes responsibility from a contractor for software licenses and support requirements that are integral to much larger IT systems, it is effectively precluded from competing the periodic renewal of such licenses and support agreements -- particularly if the systems involved have been customized and involve numerous proprietary components.  The best alternative available to the government is to negotiate and contract for long-term license and support agreements at the offset.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories is seeking U.S. commercial and U. S. research participants willing to participate in the formation of a new Meshing And Geometry Innovation Collaboration. This partnership will be executed as a series of Cooperative Research And Development Agreements (CRADA).

The technical goal of this consortium is to produce the next generation software tools to facilitate model generation (i.e. meshes) for computational analyses. The model generation technology includes means to create, import, defeature and cleanup geometric CAD models from a heterogeneous CAD environment expected to persist within the DOE and DoD. It also includes the meshing, or discretization of this geometry into acceptable elements for wildly varying analyses. Both surface (quads / tris / quad-dominant) and volume (hex, tet, hybrid, boundary layer, chimera, etc.) meshing algorithms are necessary. 

The pressing technical challenges for this effort include providing analysis-centric conceptual design geometry, providing leading edge meshing tools and significantly strengthening tools to edit, cleanup and defeature legacy geometry from varied sources. The tool set will be architected to provide streamlined end-user customization, strong modular componentization and ultimately interoperability within any custom work process.

Two government agencies are forming a partnership to initiate this collaboration, by pooling resources and consolidating management of this project. The CUBIT team, from Sandia National Laboratories, who has a strong existing product and a strong technical reputation in this area will partner with the newly forming geometry and meshing team for the CREATE program, from the DoD's High Performance Computing Modernization Office (HPCMO). This partnership will include a consortium open to any U.S. commercial participants and U.S. research institutes willing to meet the criteria outlined below.

1) Commercial Vendors. Any U. S. commercial vendor who has a significant technical product focused on meshing and/or geometry related to meshing is invited to participate. The vendor must be willing to provide their product(s) in an easily integrated form into the developed whole. This should include access to source as well as compiled libraries as appropriate. Their products must be substantive (represent at least a 30 person-year effort), and deemed technically significant by the government partners. The vendor must also be willing to allow government use (all U.S. federal government agencies and all U.S. federal government contractors in support of U.S. federal government contracts) of the integrated executable free of charge, except to cover existing software licensing costs (e.g. royalties for an existing 3rd party solid modeling engine). Such existing costs are expected to be very low. In return, the commercial vendor will be able to execute a non-exclusive commercialization agreement to market the non-protected consortium developed code to non-government users. Vendor supplied code will be designated "vendor-protected" preventing acquisition by other vendors or commercial integrators, unless such companies agree between themselves.

2) Commercial Integrators. Any U. S. commercial entity interested in direct integration of the produced code into their company products and processes is invited to participate. The commercial entity must be willing to invest, via the CRADA mechanism, at least $1M per year at Sandia to support the integrated development. In turn, they will be allowed to use the product internally free of charge, except to cover existing 3rd party licensing costs (e.g. royalties for a solid modeling package). Such costs are expected to be very low. As a paying CRADA member, they will leverage existing and future government code, and also be able to direct the use of their money toward specific capabilities needed. The commercial entity and Sandia may agree to designate specific portions thus developed to be CRADA-protected for the commercial entity's internal use as provided for by the CRADA mechanism. They will also be able to negotiate a non-exclusive commercialization agreement to market the non-protected consortium developed code to non-government users. 

3) University and Research Participants. Any U. S. university or U.S. research institution that has a significant technical product focused on meshing and/or geometry related to meshing is invited to participate. The university/institution must be willing to provide their product(s) in an easily integrated form into the developed whole. Their product(s) must be substantive and viewed as technically significant by the government partners. The university/institution must be willing to allow government use (all US federal government agencies and all US federal government contractors in support of US federal government contracts) of the integrated executable free of charge. Universities/institutions are encouraged to allow vendor and commercial integrators use of the technology, but not required. In return, they will be able to leverage the extensive existing and future developments of the consortium for use within their research organizations, and to further their research agendas. It is anticipated that participation may be encouraged by the various government funding agencies sponsoring research development.

As in the past, government developed technology will continue to be available for technology transfer via an appropriate licensing agreement. Such agreements will be handled by Sandia. However, CRADA protected and vendor supplied software would not be available through licenses with Sandia.

Sandia will use objective evaluation criteria to determine which potential partners provide the greatest likelihood of success.  Sandia anticipates having to establish one or more Agreements with potential partners which may include Commercial License Agreements, Cooperative Research And Development Agreements (CRADAs), or Work For Other (WFO) Agreements.  The use of a CRADA is preferable. In the case of CRADAs, where several potential partners are identified and selected, Sandia National Laboratories may require the selected partners to enter into a Mulitpartner CRADA with Sandia.  Selected partners should be prepared and able to accept standard CRADA Terms and Conditions "AS-IS".

To express your interest in this technology transfer opportunity, please respond by mail or fax to Steve Owen by April 8, 2008 at: Sandia National Laboratories, MS 0376, P.O. Box 5800, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87185-0376. Fax (505) 284-0140.  Please indicate the date and title of the FBO notice and describe the manner in which your company will enhance the likelihood of programmatic success.  This is not a federal government procurement and therefore there will be no debriefing regarding the results of Sandia?s selection process. 

Sandia is a multiprogram laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, a Lockheed Martin Company, for the United States Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.

Cascade Culvert Replacements Project Synopsis

The Cascade Culvert Replacements Project Solicitation package will be available for viewing and printing in approximately 15 days.  This project consists of culvert replacements on National Forest System Roads (NFSR) near Cascade, Idaho. There are 3 sites: East Fork Burntlog Creek, Lodgepole Creek, and Peanut Creek. Major items of work include: structure excavation and backfill; two culvert removals; clearing and grubbing; design, furnish and install two precast box culverts with footings and wingwalls; furnish and install a multi-plate arch with precast concrete footings; furnish and place surface course aggregate, riprap, streambed simulation rock; and seeding, fertilizing, and mulching.  PROJECT LOCATIONS:  The 3 project sites are located on the Cascade Ranger District, Boise National Forest, Valley County, Idaho.

<DESC>The result of this solicitation will be an end product contract. The scope of this contract is to provide Aerial Services in support of work for the 2008 High Lakes Stabilization Project.  The Contractor shall utilize commercial aircraft, as well as industry standard packaging, loading and unloading practices and techniques, to deliver (fly-in and fly-out) approximately 225,000 lbs of Government Furnished and/or Leased Property (i.e. earth moving equipment, fuel and miscellaneous project equipment and supplies).  Depending on load efficiencies the Government has estimated that delivery will require 32 fly-in trips and 29 fly-out trips.  Loads will weigh up to 8,000 lbs. Deliveries will be made from a Government designated non-wilderness staging area on a dam at Moon Lake, UT (elevation 8,000 to 9,000-ft) to Government designated landing areas (10,000 to 10,500 feet in elevation) at two mountain lakes in the Brown Duck Basin of the High Uintas Wilderness Area (HUWA).   
These lakes, Brown Duck Lake and Island Lake, range from approximately 5 to 5.5 air miles from the staging area.  During the estimated fly-in period (last two weeks of June) ambient air temperature at the staging area usually ranges between approximately 55 degrees and 85 degrees Fahrenheit during daylight hours.  The temperature at the landing areas are likely to be between 5-15 degrees Fahrenheit cooler than at the staging area.
It is anticipated that aerial services will be needed for 1-2 days for load delivery fly-in to landing areas and 1-2 days for load fly-out to the staging area.
Under this contract, fly-in deliveries shall be made by the Contractor within the specified timeframe (Base Bid) of June 16th to June 22nd, 2008, unless the Government has determined that on-site conditions are not viable for placement of Government Furnished and or Leased Property at the landing areas. If a non-viable determination is made the Government will choose whether or not to exercise Option 1 and deliveries will be made between June 23rd and June 30th, 2008.   
Load fly-out shall occur anytime after September 21st, 2008 but shall occur prior to the onset of winter weather that could preclude delivery services from the landing areas to the staging area.   
This Project will be uploaded into FedBizopps on approximately 3/26/2008. 
Proposals and pricing are due close of business 4/24/08

<DESC>LAIRCM NEXT GENERATION (NEXGEN) MISSILE WARNING SUBSYSTEM (MWS) PRODUCTTION PROGRAM UPDATE

The Government hereby issues an Amendment to the final Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Next Generation (NexGen) Missile Warning Subsystem (MWS) Production effort.  This Amendment is issued to clarify Section L & M requirements. 

The current RFP, in the area of Total Evaluate Cost/Price (TECP) had a discrepancy concerning O&S (now Spares & Repairs) with showing it as an other cost consideration and as proposed.  The Government intends to establish a Government Estimate of Spares & Repairs and it will be reflected in the TECP.  Also, it stated that the TECP would consist of all basic award and all options but it stated too that we would present the Depot Repair/Reprocurement data options as other cost considerations.  The Government intends for both of these options to be reflected in the TECP as well.  The Schedule Risk Assessment (SRA) has been moved in its entirety from the Proposal Risk area to the Systems Engineering/Program Management (SE/PM) sub-factor of Mission Capability.  Since the Integrated Master Schedule is a function of SE/PM, the assessment will be done within the SE/PM area.

The Government has highlighted areas to facilitate review; however, other minor clarifications exist throughout Sections L & M that are not highlighted.  The following areas have been amended:

1)	In accordance with Section L, paragraph 6.1.7, estimates of labor categories and hours for Studies and Analysis purposes have been provided in Section L, Attachment L-14.
2)	The RSP requirement kit quantities in Section L, paragraph 6.1.6, page 28 have been updated to reflect the correct amounts as displayed in Section L, Attachment L-11.
3)	The fiscal years displayed for T&M estimates for ICS, Section L, Attachment L-14, have been updated to reflect the correct fiscal years - FY08, 09, and 10.
4)	All references to Operation & Support (O&S) are changed to Spares and Repairs Support.
a.	Clarification to Section L, Paragraph 6.3.4.2; concerning O&S.
b.	Clarification to Section L, Attach L-12, O&S Spreadsheet
c.	Clarification to Section M, Section 6.0, with regards to the evaluation of the O&S data provided by the offeror(s) and Reprocurement Data/Depot Repair Options.
d.	A new Spares & Repairs spreadsheet replaces the O&S spreadsheet  
5)	Clarify Section M, Para 6.3 concerning Total Evaluated Cost/Price
6)	All Cost Realism references were removed from Section M.
7)	References to Schedule Risk Assessment have been clarified throughout Sections L & M.
8)	Model Contract
a.	Revised ASC/GRK-H004 clause and added ASC/GRK-H006 clause to address Reprocurement Data.
b.	Updated Descriptive Data on CLINS 0031 & 0032

Offeror(s) shall submit updated proposals on 27 Mar 07 (Tuesday) no later than 3:00PM (Eastern Daylight Savings Time).

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled DRAFT STAND ALONE MISSIONS OF OPPORTUNITY NOTICE ANNOUNCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITY which was posted on March 13, 2008.   REVISED DRAFT STAND ALONE MISSIONS OF OPPORTUNITY NOTICE ANNOUNCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITY This DRAFT Announcement of Opportunity has been revised to add a PEA that solicits Heliophysics U.S. Participating Investigators. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Stand Alone Missions of Opportunity Notice (SALMON), is intended to provide regular opportunities for science and technology investigations on space flight missions that advance the high priority science, technology, and exploration objectives of NASA?s four Mission Directorates. This five year Omnibus Announcement of Opportunity (AO) will incorporate regular Program Element Appendices (PEAs) for general Mission of Opportunity (MO) proposal opportunities as well as focused proposal opportunities for specific flight opportunities. This AO will include domestic and foreign-led mission opportunities. PEAs will solicit proposals addressing specific topics of interest from the four NASA Mission Directorates. Proposals will typically be solicited in one or more of five MO categories: Partner Missions of Opportunity, U.S. Participating Investigators, New Science Missions using Existing Spacecraft, Small Complete Missions, and Focused Opportunities. This approach will better enable NASA and the science and technology communities to maximize their participation in domestic and international space flight missions of opportunity.  NASA is releasing a DRAFT of the SALMON AO for community review and comment. The six PEAs included in this DRAFT solicit: Lunar and Planetary Science Partner Missions of Opportunity, Lunar and Planetary Science U.S. Participating Investigators, Small Complete Missions of Opportunity in Astrobiology and Fundamental Space Biology, Earth Science U.S. Participating Investigators, Astrophysics U.S. Participating Investigators, and Heliophysics U.S. Participating Investigators. Participation in this AO will be open to all categories of organizations (U.S. and non-U.S.), including educational institutions, industry, not-for-profit organizations, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), NASA Centers, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and other Government agencies.  NASA welcomes critical review and comment of this DRAFT, which will be available through April 4, 2008, at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/	 . Send comments to Dr. Carlos Liceaga, Science Mission Directorate, NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC 20546-0001. E-mail: Carlos.A.Liceaga@nasa.gov. Comments are preferred in writing and may be sent by E-mail; the character string "SALMON DRAFT AO" (without quotes) should be included in the subject line of all transmissions. The identity of those submitting comments will be held in confidence.  Answers to frequently asked questions about this DRAFT will be made available on the SALMON Acquisition Additional Information web page at http://salmon.larc.nasa.gov/index.html	  .

<DESC>CBD Notice posted on February 25, 2008 and amended on March 17, 2008 is hereby amended to change the Request for Qualifications (RFQ) issuance date from on or about March 25, 2008 to on or about March 31, 2008.  

The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for public architecture, engineering, and construction through a Design-Build / Bridging delivery method.      

GSA intends to award one (1) firm-fixed price Design-Build contract for all design and construction services necessary for Site Utility Upgrades ? 13.8kV Primary Electrical Distribution System located at the Nebraska Avenue Complex, 3801 Nebraska Avenue, NW,  Washington, DC, Procurement Request Number WPJ-08-0289.  The Site Utility Upgrades ? 13.8kV Primary Electrical Distribution System is a renovation of an electrical system on an occupied facility.   

Construction completion and final acceptance is expected to occur on or before December 29, 2010.  The anticipated cost for the project is between $20,000,000 and $30,000,000, and will consist of a renovation of an electrical system on an occupied facility.  

The proposed site covers approximately 25 acres, bounded by Nebraska Avenue, Massachusetts Avenue, Rock Creek, and private property.   The scope of the project is to provide a three feeder spot network electrical system including utility metering switchgear, underground distribution, underground vaults and connections to the existing buildings. Critical programmatic requirements include the need to keep the existing buildings in operation until the new system is complete.  

The design-build scope of work includes all engineering, civil, architectural /structural, design, construction, and other related services necessary to design and to construct the electrical distribution system.  Related services include, but are not limited to, geotechnical evaluation and monitoring, archaeological monitoring, permitting, testing and inspection during construction, commissioning and potential additional geotechnical analysis of the site.  Preliminary approvals have been secured from National Capital Planning Commission for the current design. Additional submissions will be required to secure final approvals.

This project requires the construction of a new primary electrical system including underground utility metering vault, duct banks, underground network transformer vaults, connection to existing electrical systems and removal of the existing electrical system, including salvage of designated equipment at the Nebraska Avenue Complex, together with associated mechanical, electrical and general construction work. Work includes selective demolition of existing electrical system and storm water system, and provision of underground electrical substation vaults, electrical distribution system, spot network substations, including transformers and switchgear, medium voltage metering switchgear and cabling, PEPCO connections, switchboards, connections to existing electrical system, temporary wiring, excavation and backfill and surface restoration and incidental related work. The Contractor shall provide the services of Registered Professional Engineers and Architects, experienced in the type of work contemplated, to provide design, calculations, field survey, drawings and specifications covering the work. Disciplines anticipated include electrical engineering, structural engineering, civil engineering, architecture, and horticulture.

The Contractor shall provide all the necessary labor, materials, supervision, management, quality control plan and testing to produce a finished and operational electrical system conforming to the contract documents.

The completed project will meet or exceed all Federal design and construction statutes, standards, and regulations, including but not limited to the energy goals stated in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards, and Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection measures.  

Interested Offerors must be a firm or joint venture with experience, individually or as a member of a team, which has successfully and satisfactorily completed projects of similar complexity, scope, and size; or, which has similar projects currently in construction.

The design of the engineering and architectural features of the project shall be accomplished or reviewed and approved by engineers and architects registered to practice in their particular field within the District of Columbia.  The architect-engineer portion of this design-build entity must be a firm or joint venture having an existing active office located within the Washington, DC metropolitan area.  This existing active office will have the responsibility for providing the architectural and engineering services.

Offerors, individually or as a team, must have the capacity to obtain performance and payment bonding for up to 100% of the firm-fixed-price Design-Build Contract.

While the contractor?s personnel will have to satisfy the requirements of Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12, the Government does not anticipate that any special security clearance (i.e., TOP SECRET) will be required to participate in this procurement.  

GSA intends to award a firm-fixed-price design-build contract pursuant to the procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 36.3 and Subpart 15.  The procurement will be completed in two phases: Phase 1 will be a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) and Phase 2 will be a Request for Proposals (RFP).  During Phase 1, Offerors will prepare and submit their qualifications as specified in the RFQ package which will be issued on or about March 17, 2008, on the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  

The evaluation factors for Phase 1 are as follows:  1) Past Performance, 2) Technical Approach, 3) Specialized Experience and Technical Competency, and 4) Capability to Perform.  Refer to the Request for Qualifications (RFQ) package for details on the Phase 1 evaluation criteria and information for submittals.  On or about early May 2008, the Government anticipates extending invitations to a maximum of five (5) of the most highly qualified offerors to submit Phase 2 proposals, which will be due on or about mid June 2008.  The short listed firms will be issued the Request for Proposal (RFP) package and may undergo a presentation and review process under separate evaluation factors.  Details on the evaluation factors and submittals will be outlined in the RFP.  The Government anticipates making an award in July 2008.  This solicitation is not set-aside for small businesses.  However, this procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program (F.A.R. 52-219-19).  Any qualified responsible firm, including small, veteran-owned small, service-disabled veteran-owned small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small businesses, is encouraged to participate as prime contractors, or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses, or as subcontractors.  

The General Services Administration (GSA) is committed to assuring that maximum practicable opportunity is provided to small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran owned small business concerns to participate in the performance of this contract consistent with its efficient performance.  

The General Services Administration (GSA) expects any subcontracting plan submitted pursuant to FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, to reflect this commitment.  Consequently, an Offeror, other than a small business concern, before being awarded a contract exceeding $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction), must demonstrate that its subcontracting plan represents a creative and innovative program for involving small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran owned small business concerns as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.  YOU ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO REGISTER TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION OF UPLOAD OF THE RFQ AT THIS SITE AND REGISTER ON THE INTERESTED VENDOR LIST (IVL).  In accordance with the requirements of the RFQ, Phase 1 proposals shall be submitted approximately April 25, 2008, by 1:00 PM, EST, to the following address: GSA, NCR, ROB, Bid Activity (WPP) - Room 1065, Seventh and D Streets, SW, Washington, DC 20407.

<CONTACT>Frederick Washington, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-875-4985, Fax 703-875-4985, Email washingtonfj@state.gov
<DESC>Nature and Volume of the Proposed Work

To perform the 2009 U.S. Department of State (Department) financial statements audit OIG needs the services of a certified public accounting firm that has professionally qualified personnel with experience in CFO audits and is able to dedicate full time, federally-experienced professional staff members from early July 2009 to early December 2009.  The Department?s assets total about $45 Billion and its annual budget exceeds $30 Billion. 

The contractor shall:

?	Determine and report on whether the financial statements and related notes present fairly, in all material respects, the assets, liabilities, and net position; net costs, changes in net position, and  budgetary resources, in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  
?	Perform appropriate procedures consistent with AICPA Auditing Standard AU Section 558, "Required Supplementary Information," on all Required Supplementary Information included in the Department?s FY 2009 consolidated financial statements.  
?	Determine whether risk-assumed information (including projections of pensions) is presented fairly in all material respects, in accordance with the requirements of the Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS) No. 5, and any subsequent revisions.  If a specialist is used for this work, the auditor shall comply with guidance in AU Section 336, ?Using the Work of a Specialist.? 
?	Assess whether the other accompanying information, or its manner of presentation, is materially consistent with the information in the Annual Statements.
?	Evaluate and report on internal control and the internal control environment related to the FY 2009 consolidated financial statements for the Department.  This should include, but not be limited to, obtaining an understanding of the components of internal control, assessing the level of control risk relevant to the assertions embodied in the classes of transactions, account balances, and disclosures components of the financial statements, and performing tests of the Department?s internal controls.  
o	Review information system general and application controls in the Department?s applications that are significant to the financial statements to the extent necessary to (1) conclude whether general controls are properly designed and operating effectively, (2) consider application controls as part of the internal control assessment in the financial statement audit, and (3) support the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) assessment. 
?	Obtain an understanding of the process by which the agency identifies and evaluates weaknesses required to be reported under the Federal Managers? Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) and related agency implementing procedures.  Compare material weaknesses disclosed during the audit with those material weaknesses reported in the agency's FMFIA report that relate to the financial statements.  If material weaknesses were disclosed during the audit that were not reported in the Department?s FMFIA report, auditor will determine whether the failure to detect and report material weaknesses constitutes a significant deficiency or material weakness in the entity?s internal control.  In order to address this objective, auditor should obtain information on the Department?s efforts to implement OMB Circular A-123, Appendix A.
?	Perform tests of compliance with laws and regulations that could have a direct and material effect on the Department?s FY 2009 financial statements, including FFMIA.
?	For allocation transfers, coordinate early with ?child? agencies to ensure that adequate audit coverage will be provided.  
?	Determine whether the special-purpose financial statements and accompanying notes present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, net costs and changes in net position, in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the presentation requirements set forth in the Treasury Financial Manual (TFM), Chapter 4700.
?	Obtain an understanding of internal control over the financial reporting process for the special-purpose financial statements and perform tests of those controls.  
?	Perform tests of compliance with TFM Chapter 4700.  
?	Assess the reasonableness of FY 2009 retirement, health, and life insurance withholdings/contributions, and employee headcount information provided to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), as required by OMB Bulletin 07-04.  Comply with any additional guidance issued by either OPM or OMB during FY 2009.

The contractor must demonstrate that it has successfully performed agency-wide financial statement audits of large highly complex and decentralized agencies, and issued unqualified auditors? opinions on time and in full compliance with all federal government and professional standards.  It must have had these audits assessed by the Government Accountability Office to give assurance that they complied with the GAO/PCIE FAM on these audits.

Also, the contractor must demonstrate (1) its qualifications to assess the effectiveness of the Department?s information systems control environment; (2) that its IT specialists have a thorough working knowledge of FISCAM; (3) experience auditing a government agency with multiple financial management systems; (4) past experience in successfully transitioning to be the new auditor of a large complex agency; (5) experience in auditing pension funds and working with actuaries; (6) experience auditing agencies with a significant amount of grant activity; and (7) experience auditing working capital funds.
All personnel assigned to the audit must have Secret security clearances.  





Location of Work

Metropolitan Washington, D.C. Area and other domestic and foreign locations including developing states.  The Department has embassies, consulates, and other posts in over 260 locations, and processes financial data in Washington, D.C., Charleston, S.C., and Bangkok, Thailand.

<DESC>Interpretation and translation support to the Global Threat Reduction (GTR) project, as well as other projects supporting contract work in Russia, the United States, and possible in other nations, dealing with nuclear and radiological threat reduction issues. Interpretation will primarily be consecutive interpretation of mid-to-high-level meetings, negotiations and foreign visits associated with the securing, dismantlement and disposition of industrial radioactive sources and radioisotope thermoelectric generators. Translation of contract documents exchanged daily and interpretation will primarily be English-to-Russian and Russian-to-English; however, similar support may also be required for other languages.  

Interpreting will be at sites in Russia, the United States, or other nations, as well as during weekly conference calls between the U.S. Project Team and Russian Teams.  Foreign travel, occasionally to spartan locations, will be a requirement.  Adherence to the specifications of Department of Energy (DOE) Order 551.1 B Official Foreign Travel is required, and participation in pre-travel briefings and post-travel debriefings is required, if requested.  All foreign nationals providing support will be subject to assignment under the provisions of DOE Order 142.3 Unclassified Foreign Visits and Assignments, and will thereby be required to provide additional information related to their passports and visas.  On-site interpretation support will typically require two interpreters, and in Russia, one interpreter must be included on the currently-approved Russian Federation 185 Access List.

Please submit a capabilities statement for this requirement and include a list of interpreters currently on the approved Russian Federation 185 Access List.

<SUBJECT>A--INSTRUMENTS FOR LADEE LUNAR MISSION
<SOLNBR>NNH08ZDA006L
<RESPDATE>041808
<ARCHDATE>03252009
<CONTACT>Dr. Sarah  Noble, Scientist, Phone 202-358-3725, Fax 202-358-3097, Email sarah.noble-1@nasa.gov
<DESC>The Government is seeking information regarding existing instruments (such as flight spares and engineering models) that could be quickly flight qualified, accommodated, and flown on the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE), scheduled for a 2010-2011 launch. The Government is also interested in potential ?build to print? possibilities from existing flight instruments, in the event that there are no flight spares available. In particular, the Government is seeking capable neutral mass spectrometers and sensitive dust detectors for this opportunity. However other available lightweight instrument types that could provide alternative data sets to address the composition and structure of the tenuous lunar atmosphere, or the presence and distribution of dust above the lunar surface, will also be considered.  In accordance with FAR 15.201 (e), the information requested is for planning purposes only and is not intended to bind the Government. This information will be used to inform NASA?s program planning, including consideration of whether and how to solicit instruments for the LADEE mission. Background LADEE is a strategic mission that will address science goals 8a and 8b from the 2007 National Research Council Study ?The Scientific Context for Exploration of the Moon? to the extent that is possible within the limitations imposed by mass, cost, and duration of the proposed mission.   The objectives of the LADEE mission are:  1. Determine the global density, composition, and time variability of the fragile lunar atmosphere before it is perturbed by further human activity; 2. Determine if the Apollo astronaut sightings of diffuse emission at 10s of km above the surface were Na glow or dust and; 3. Document the dust impactor environment (size-frequency) to help guide design engineering for the outpost and also future robotic missions. NASA expects to place this orbiter into a low orbit (tentatively about 50 km) for at least four months (one month of check-out, and three months of data collection).  The mission will be small; it is expected that the total available mass for all two or even three payload instruments will be approximately 20 kg. The available payload power is approximately 60W, but can peak to 100W depending on spacecraft orientation and thermal constraints.  The payload data rate is approximately 10Kbps with our baseline S-band communications system. Detailed trade studies of orbital elements versus payload mass and mission length are underway now. The orbiter payload is expected to include two instruments: a dust detector and a neutral mass spectrometer.  However, there may be sufficient mass to include an additional atmospheric instrument. The mass devoted to science payload (instruments) is strictly limited, and will not be allowed to grow.  The tight schedule (in order to reach launch in 2010-2011) and limited budget precludes extensive instrument development for this mission. Description of Anticipated Requirement  The Government is initiating several new lunar missions based on the President?s Fiscal Year 2009 budget request including both orbiters and landers. These missions are lunar science missions within the overall envelope of the U.S. Space Exploration Policy. This Request for Information is directed to the first of these, a small lunar orbiter, LADEE, that will address elements of the 2007 National Research Council (NRC) Report, ?Scientific Context for the Exploration of the Moon,? hereafter SCEM, in particular, the lunar environment (see objectives 8a and 8b in SCEM). A small spacecraft is now under development at NASA?s Ames Research Center under the direction of Dr. Butler Hine, project manager. Early estimates suggest that the spacecraft can accommodate approximately 20 kg of science instrumentation, although the precise mass of payload will depend on the launch mass available to the mission (LADEE is planned to be launched as a secondary payload with NASA?s GRAIL mission) as well as on the precise lunar orbit chosen for the mission. The current spacecraft schedule requires that the science instruments be delivered to Goddard Space Flight Center for accommodation on the spacecraft by April 2010.   The total budget for the LADEE mission through phase E is $80M. Schedule and budget constraints require that NASA mission planners focus on mature instruments including flight spares from other missions, engineering models for instruments from existing flight instruments that can easily be flight qualified, or at worst ?build to print? instruments. If it is determined to be advantageous to the Government, the Government could initiate acquisition of instruments as early as 2008. The NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) has issued this request for information (RFI) to survey the community for existing flight or near flight instruments that can potentially provide data sets relevant to the science objectives of the LADEE mission. The initial focus is on sensitive neutral mass spectrometers and on dust detectors, but other kinds of instruments are of interest if a case can be made that these instruments would also substantially address one or more of the goals of the LADEE mission and can be accommodated on the mission. The Government will also accept information on flight instruments that are ?build to print.? That is, instruments already flying on other missions, or that have recently flown in space, and that can be built from the flight article prints without substantive change. It is not NASA?s intent to publicly disclose proprietary information obtained during this RFI. To the full extent that it is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations, information identified by a respondent as ?Proprietary or Confidential? will be kept confidential. It is emphasized that this RFI is for planning and information purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Instructions for Response: The response to this RFI will be in the form of a PDF document that is uploaded through NASA's NSPIRES system. The response should not exceed four pages in length. NASA is soliciting information that might be used by NASA to facilitate planning for new uses of existing spacecraft.  Material in a RFI response is confidential, nonbinding on the respondent, and will be used by NASA for information and planning purposes only. This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. No proposals will be awarded funding as a result of this RFI. The complete RFI including background, requested information, and instructions for responding may be found at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/	  (select "Solicitations" then "Open  Solicitations" then "Request for Information (NNH08ZDA006L): Instruments for LADEE Lunar Mission"). Responses to this RFI must be submitted no later than April 18, 2008. Contact Point Questions concerning this Request for Information should be addressed to Dr. Sarah Noble, Planetary Science Division, Science Mission Directorate, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, DC 20546; Telephone: (202) 358-3725; E-mail: sarah.noble-1@nasa.gov.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, Warren Grant Magnuson Center (Clinical Center), Pharmacy Department has a requirement for a Biomedical IT and Administrative Support.  This Contract calls for contractor support relating to certain activities in the DCRI Scientific Computing Section (SCS).  A major theme relating to all of these activities is ?a multidisciplinary research team approach to biomedical data mining.? The concept ?biomedical data mining? as used here is intended to convey the idea of utilizing captured biomedical scientific and administrative data to discover new knowledge, to confirm or refute tentative hypotheses, and/or to suggest new hypotheses worthy of exploring.  This is in contrast (but complementary to) the more traditional hypothesis driven paradigm typically the hallmark of biomedical research. ?Multidisciplinary research team,? a concept inspired by the NIH Roadmap, suggests a team approach to data mining. Such teams may be comprised of biomedical research scientists, computer scientists, electrical engineers, statisticians, mathematicians, administrators, technical writers, intellectual property experts, etc.  In short, whatever skills needed to achieve rapid, high-quality results from data mining efforts would be assembled to work closely together under this multidisciplinary team model. The SCS directs and coordinates the NIH Biomedical Computing Interest Group (BCIG) which is one of the largest and most active of the 100+ special interest groups at the NIH.   The SCS also runs an active student program in which graduate and undergraduates students in computer science, engineering and the biomedical sciences work part time to advance the goals of the SCS.
This requirement is set-aside for small business concerns under the applicable NAICS code, 541512.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.     It is anticipated that the solicitation will be released fifteen (15) days after this synopsis publication.  No phone calls please.

<DESC>Software Assurance Metrics and Tool Evaluation (SAMTE)

This is a Source Sought notice to assist NIST in completing market research for a procurement that is planned for Spring FY2008.  No Solicitation is currently available, and no unsolicited proposals will be entertained as a result of this Sources Sought Notice.
The specific purpose of this sources sought announcement is to identify sources that are capable of providing the services identified below.     

NIST will have a requirement for SAMTE and will be acquiring precise definitions of the top 100 security flaws in source code which makes up computer software.  The definitions must be:
  (a) unambiguous, to preclude arguments about what would prevent a flaw or how to find it;
  (b) understandable to humans, so experts can validate them; and,
  (c) formal enough for automatic processing, to be input to automatically generate flawed test programs.

Currently there is a list of some 550 flaws with rough descriptions of each flaw common weakness enumeration (CWE).  Those descriptions are incomplete, ambiguous, and written in informal English, for the most part.  However the list is publicly available, actively being improved and has broad community support, thus the list is a good starting point.

Each definition must follow the Software Assurance Ecosystem, Mans06 (see Item 1 below).  In particular, they must use the ISO/IEC 19502 Meta Object Facility and the JSR0040 Java Metadata Interface.  They must follow the OMG Knowledge Discovery Meta-model standard ?Architecture-driven Modernization,? ADMSpec06 (see Item 2 below), specifically, the ISO/IEC 19503 XML Metadata Interchange (XMI), and must use CWE Micro Rules.

Each definition consists of two parts.  Part one is a "contractual formalization", that is, written in a specific stylized English with a prescribed vocabulary (as in a contract).  Part two is a "technical formalization", written in a constraint language, CWE Micro Rules, expressing the same meaning as the contractual formalization.

	Item 1.  (Mans06) Nikolai Mansourov, Djenana Campara, Norman Rajala, and Sumeet Malhotra, "High Fidelity Static Analysis for Secure Enterprise Software Requires Platform Knowledge", in Proc. Static Analysis Summit, Elizabeth Fong, ed., Gaithersburg, Maryland, NIST Special Publication 500-262, July 2006, pp 55-61.  Available at http://samate.nist.gov/docs/NIST_Special_Publication_500-262.pdf

HOW TO RESPOND TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE: 
If your company has recent experiences with projects that are similar in scope to what may be required the upcoming procurement for SAMTE, then please provide the following information (2 pages or less, total): 
1.  Description of each related project completed by your company as a prime Contractor or as a significant subcontractor within the past three (3) years, including as much of the following information as possible: 
(a) a brief description of the technical requirements of that project; 
(b) the specific information on your company?s previous experience in writing mathematical precise descriptions related to Information Technology software; and,
(c)  the name, address, point of contact and phone number of customer organization for which the work was done.
2. indication of whether your company currently has an active registration in the Central Contractor Registration at www.ccr.gov.

Interested sources that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this project should submit an electronic copy of their capability statement, addressing the criteria identified above.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  Written capability statement shall clearly and unambiguously demonstrate ability to perform work of the nature identified in this notice.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is an announcement seeking market information to identify potential sources capable of providing the services as described herein.  This is a sources sought announcement and not a Request for Proposals (RFP).     It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.

The applicable NAICS code is 541620 and the Size Standard is $6.5 million average annual receipt for the preceding three fiscal years.

We are currently conducting market research to determine whether a viable commercial industrial base exists which is qualified, experienced, and interested in performing the tasks described in the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS).     

Work currently performed by third party contractors, site remediation for example, are not and will not be included in this effort.     Due to the future potential for organizational conflicts of interest, it is expected that the successful offeror from any subsequent competition will be ineligible to compete for these third party contractor workloads.     Additional information concerning third party contractor workloads will be furnished at a later date to firms responding to this announcement.         

Companies who are qualified and/or experienced in all of the tasks described in the attached PWS are invited to submit up to 10 single-spaced pages briefly describing experience and qualifications that support your company?s capability in meeting these requirements.  Failure to provide documentation may result in the government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities.  If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting).  Company brochures are acceptable as long as they are sufficiently detailed and the total submission does not exceed 10 pages.  Any interested firm should submit an original and one copy of their capability statement that demonstrates the firm's ability to perform the key requirements described herein.     

PART I.  BUSINESS INFORMATION
Responses must include the following business information for your company and for any teaming partners: (1) Name and Address of the Organization, (2) State type of Business based on NAICS code 541620 (i.e. small business, disadvantaged, 8(a) Certified, HUBZone Certified, etc), (3) Point of contact with name, title, phone, fax, email, and web page URL, (4) CAGE/DUNS number, (5) Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Yes/No, and (6) a statement as to whether your company is domestically or foreign owned (if foreign, please indicate the country of ownership).     

PART II.  CAPABILITY SURVEY QUESTIONS

GENERAL CAPABILITY QUESTIONS
1.	Define your company's capability in meeting the requirements, as defined in the PWS, and the nature of the services you provide.  Include a description of your staff composition and management structure.  For any teaming arrangements, also provide teaming partner?s capability in meeting the requirements and nature of services provided, along with staff composition and management structure.

2.	Describe your company's past experience on previous projects similar in complexity to this requirement.  Include contract numbers, a brief description of the work performed, period of performance, agency/organization supported, and individual point of contact (Contracting Officer or Program Manager).  For any teaming arrangements, describe teaming partner?s past experience on previous projects similar in complexity to this requirement.  


COMMERCIALITY QUESTIONS:
1.	Are there any commercial business practices unique to your industry?  If so, please describe.

2.	If you offer this service to both the U.S. Government and commercial sources, is the same workforce used for both the U.S. Government and general public?  Is our requirement offered to both under similar terms and conditions?  Briefly describe any differences.

Any costs incurred as a result of responding to this announcement shall be borne by the respondent and cannot be charged to the Government for reimbursement.     This Sources Sought Notice incorporates by reference FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997).

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought<BR>---------------<BR>A.	 General Information<BR><BR>The Pacific Region-TRBO Region 12, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 18 Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps medical treatment fac ilities in Hawaii, Guam, Japan, Okinawa, and Korea announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Non Adherent Dressings. <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of car e across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program <BR><BR>The ma jor facilities in the region include Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, 121st Combat Support Hospital Seoul, 374th Medical Group, Yokota AB, and 18th Medical Group Kadena AB.<BR ><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agr eement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ i s a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods. Anticipated selection date is February 2009. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinic al/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will be come more important.  The selection will be determined utili zing Best value/trade-off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, select ion would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability. <BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Susan Hwang, TRBO Team Leader<BR>(808) 433-3686, susan.hwang@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>Cheryl Janus, TRBO Clinical Analyst<BR>(808) 433-7985, cheryl.ja nus@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required<BR><BR>The Pacific Region is seeking product line items, in the category of Non Adherent Dressings, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines listed in the technical criteria. Within this  region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $22,942. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. The top high volume usage lines for this project are listed in the Technical/Company Criteria below. <BR><BR>At the request of the Pacific Region Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by t he vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to susan.hwang@ amedd.army.mil AND cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil. Submissions must be received by 4:00 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the specified closing date/time of this solicitation. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating. All e-mail communications between vendors and the region will be digitally signed.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements of electronic r esponses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm wit h the Regional POC that their initial submission, quotes, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequa te time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  <BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board inclu des clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Pacific Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative. <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions. Vend or quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Ven dor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the Vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region). Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct dis cussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If industry participation is unsatisfactory, the TPRB will decide whether to proceed with or delay the project.<BR><BR>Phase I: Technical/Company Evaluation Process<BR><BR>Interested  vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate to the above POC by the required response date. Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each v endor. Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below. Vendors that do not meet the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. All technical/company criteria ar e weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate i n the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate: (1) the business concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manuf acturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumable; (2) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, a pplicable to such product or services; (3) the vendor has or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items with Cardinal Health, the Prime Ven dor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a di scount from DAPA will be disqualified); and, (6) the vendors information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify th e vendor from further consideration.<BR><BR>The following Technical/Company Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>1.	Vendor must manufacture and/or distribute a complete product line of Non Adherent Dressings. A comple te line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per or der. At a minimum, the following items are required: Dressing absorbent/non-stick gauze sterile 3 inch by 4 inch. Dressing absorbent/non-stick gauze sterile 2 inch by 3 inch. Emollient dressing petrolatum 3 inch by 18 inch. Emollient dressing petrolatum 3 inch by 36 inch. Emollient dressing with 3% bismuth tribromophenate in 1 inch by 8 inch. Emollient dressing with 3% bismuth tribromophenate 5 inch by 9 inch. Dressing non-adherent oil emulsion 3 inch by 16 inch.<BR>2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Non Adherent Dressings product line. Provided the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal. (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified).<BR>3.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the regional prime vendor Cardinal Health for distribution in this Region and provide certification of this with the initial submittal. (Note that vendors whose products are no t available through the regional PV will be disqualified).<BR><BR>4.	Vendors must provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement  to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price. Therefore, FSS prices do not represent a discount of DAPA. (Note that vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified).<BR>5.	Vendor must provide customer service (telephonic and e-mail)  for regional facilities. Identify company resources and capabilities for such support with the initial submittal.<BR><BR>Phase II: Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process<BR><BR>The multi-disciplinary TPRB clinical team will request samples (no charge) fr om the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities. The sample set will include 10 each dressing absorbent/non-stick gauze sterile 3 inch by 4 inch. Dressing absorbent/non-stick gauze sterile 2 inch by 3 inch. Emollient dressing petrolatum 3 inch by 18 inch. Emollient dressing petrolatum 3 inch by 36 inch. Emollient dressing with 3% bismuth tribromophenate in 1 inch by 8 inch. Emollient dressing with 3% bismuth tribromophenate 5 inch by 9 inch. Dressing non-adherent oil e mulsion 3 inch by 16 inch.Vendors are required to ship their no cost samples directly to the designated MTFs and will be allowed 21 calendar days   from the date of notification to complete the delivery. Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB,  4:00 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the 21st calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.<BR><BR>Specific MTFs will evaluate the clini cal/performance criteria using a Likert type scale, with a one to five rating. One (1) = Strongly Disagree, Two (2) = Disagree, Three (3) = Neutral, Four (4) = Agree, and Five (5) = Strongly Agree. All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. <B R><BR>To determine acceptability, the TPRB clinical team, comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines, will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below. The TPRB clinical team intends that clinical evaluations be conducted  in a clinical (patient) setting; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct evaluation in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both.<BR><BR> The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>1.	Product packaging can be easily opened to maintain sterility (without touching the product, the product is easily dropped on sterile  field, seams peel open evenly, packaging does not shred, fray or tear unevenly on either side of package) (to prevent contamination)<BR>2.	Product does not adhere to skin (product can easily be removed despite the duration of application, does not stick t o wound) (to protect the patient, safety)<BR>3.	Product does not tear or fall apart when removed from skin (product does not shred, fray or tear upon removal) (to protect the patient, safety)<BR>4.	Product is absorbent (texture and weave of product absorbs  and retains blood, serous fluid without dripping or leaking). (to protect the patient, safety)<BR>5.	Product is non abrasive when placed against skin (product does not chafe or cause any type of irritation to the skin redness, bumps). (to protect the pati ent, safety)<BR>6.	Product does not lint (no material flakes, falls or drops from product when product is opened or placed on the wound) (to protect the patient, safety)<BR>7.	Product remains in place as applied by clinician (product does not move or slide  off the wound area, product does not crinkle, wrinkle or stick to the clinicians gloves) (to protect the patient, safety).<BR><BR><BR>Phase III: Pricing Analysis Process<BR><BR>After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendo rs in the clinical evaluation group will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirements. Vendors will be provided seven (7) calendar days to s ubmit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email. Price quotes must be received by 4:00 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the 7th calendar day. Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA pric es will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/participation. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s) without discussion as noted above. However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussion  and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. <BR>As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two (2) year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). The following elements will be considered in the pri cing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines, (3) Potential Cost Avoidance (this is included as a reporting metric) and (4) Consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor. SKU review will assess the number of line items a vendor is able to supply to the MTFs versus the number of currently used line items.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS.<BR><BR>The Joint Personnel Recovery Agency (JPRA), United States Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM), calls on industry to provide concepts for inexpensive capabilities to locate an d/or track US military personnel that become isolated, missing, detained, or captured anywhere in the world.  Advanced survival radios issued to aircrew and other specialized occupations are effective, but their expense and complexity preclude distribution  to all personnel at risk of becoming isolated from friendly control.  JPRA is particularly interested in industry concepts that trade features/complexity in exchange for very low cost.<BR><BR>Ideally, a system to locate and/or track personnel would have a ll of the necessary characteristics to provide globally effective, near-real time awareness of an isolated persons location and status.  However, given the many technical and operational challenges associated with that ideal, it is understood that certain  concepts may provide only a partial capability and would likely need to be combined with other capabilities for a total solution.  For example, a concept may provide promising capabilities but only within a limited geographical area and under certain spec ified conditions.  Submission of either ideal or partial capability concepts is desired.<BR><BR>Depending on the nature of the concept being proposed, some of the desired characteristics described below may not apply.  <BR><BR>Desired characteristics:<BR>< BR>- Very good accuracy for location information  <BR>- Provides for frequent location updates<BR>- Enables location/tracking of personnel anywhere in the world at any time<BR>- Identity / Authentication<BR>- If an individual must carry a device, ideally i t would be:<BR>  -- Small<BR>  -- Inexpensive (Less Than $500 ea)<BR>  -- Capable of duplex signaling (i.e. an isolated person would get a confirmation a distress signal was received on the other end).  <BR>  -- Provide for discreet transmissions that are not likely to be readily detected or exploitable by unintended recipients<BR>  -- Able to provide useful location/tracking information for a day or more after it is activated<BR>  -- Allows use of commercially available batteries that are replaceable by th e user<BR>  -- Minimal training requirements<BR><BR>If a concepts effectiveness depends upon the existence of other infrastructure (sensors, airborne or space systems, networks, etc.), it should describe those dependencies with as much specificity as poss ible.<BR><BR>Please include the companys willingness to demonstrate products / concepts.  JPRA will not pay for or provide reimbursement for any costs incurred in the preparation or delivery of the requested INFORMATION.  Industry firms capable of providi ng the required systems are invited to submit a response to this notice.  Firms should include literature, brochures, price lists, estimated production capacity, and capabilities summaries directly addressing their ability to meet the aforementioned needs.   At a minimum, the capabilities summary should include the following: system description, performance parameters (e.g., weight, power, size, etc) and external dependencies.<BR><BR>Interested firms are requested to respond NLT 20 April 2008.<BR><BR>SEND RE SPONSES TO: Joint Personnel Recovery Agency (JPRA/J9, Bldg 334); ATTN Captain Thomas Martin; 10244 Burbeck Road; Fort Belvoir, VA 22060.<BR><BR>Points of Contact<BR>THOMAS P.

Derek Hewgill continues to conduct and operate the FACS Core Facility, and maintain quality
control on flow cytometers which are used for multi-parameter analytic and preparative studies
of the binding fluorescent ligands to suspensions of single cells, nuclei or chromosomes as well
as analysis of cells transfected with constructs expressing fluorescently tagged proteins. The
Flow cytometers are complex, highly sophisticated instruments, which simultaneously measure
cell size and fluorescence at different wavelengths in individual cells. Specifically, the task to be
performed by Mr. Hewgill is to continue to provide services on BD Biosciences flow cytometry
systems including CellQuest software and with the knowledge of cell sorting, specifically with
FACS MO-Flo. Utilization and oversight of this equipment are crucial for the performance of

populations including those with HIV/AIDS, oral squamous cell carcinoma, lymphomas and
infectious diseases will be monitored for diagnostic and prognostic purposes to guide their
treatment. Mr. Hewgill is expected to stain transfect, analyze and sort rare lymphocyte
subpopulations at the single cell level and in bulk for molecular and functional analysis to be
performed. He will utilize the most current technology available, and keep careful records of all
experiments that are performed. The instrumentation consisted of a three (3) laser, 12 parameter
Cytomation MoFlo highspeed sorters, a FACScalibur with four (4) colors options, two( 2) laser

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Synopsis: Request for Proposals Solicitation 8008-23 seeks flight services consisting of two small helicopters (that meet or exceed the minimum requirements listed below) which are fully Contractor operated and maintained, in support of the Bureau of Land Management, Socorro Field Office, New Mexico fire management programs.  The helicopters will be used for two 12 days use periods (may not be at the same time) based 30 nm SE of Datil, NM supporting prescribed fire operations, but may assist suppression, recon, or other Government missions during the use period.  The helicopters will be used some time between May 1, 2008 and June 30, 2008 with 72 hour or greater notice.  Successful Contractors must have a current Aircraft Rental Agreement with the Department of the Interior or be able to meet the terms and conditions of the agreement which will be incorporated into the conformed contract. The Contractor shall have at least a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certificate issued under 14 CFR Part 135 and be carded (or capable of being) for Plastic Sphere Dispensing (PSD), aerial ignition operations, interagency fire, and external loads. The anticipated issue date of the solicitation is March 25, 2008 closing April 2, 2008 at 2pm MDT. It is a requirement that the successful awardee be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). The solicitation will also be available at www.amd.nbc.gov.  The solicitation is under NAICS 481211 (size standard <1500 employees) for non-scheduled charter air transportation and is set aside for small business concerns.   Contact Matt DeLong at 208-433-5029 with questions. Additional Description and Pricing Pages: 1.	  Objective:   To obtain fully contractor operated and maintained small helicopter services in support of the New Mexico BLM. The BLM Socorro Field office has a requirement for two small helicopters to help conduct a prescribed burn.  The prescribed fire will be conducted sometime between May 1st, 2008 and June 30th, 2008.  Two helicopters will be needed for approximately 12 consecutive days during that period but may not be used at the same time.  Due to the uncertainties inherent in prescribed fire operations, the exclusive use period may need to be extended for one or both helicopters for additional time.  Extensions shall be executed upon the mutual agreement of both parties on a day to day basis.  Exact start and stop dates of the exclusive use periods may not be determined until 72 hours prior to commencement of work. The helicopters will be based at a remote helibase which will be located approximately 30 nautical miles southeast of Datil, New Mexico.  The nearest airport with jet fuel is Truth or Consequences, NM at a distance of approximately 35 nautical miles SE of the helibase.  One fuel servicing vehicle and driver will be required on site for each helicopter unless both line items are awarded to the same Contractor in which case only one vehicle and driver may be required.  Due to the remote location and the lack of lodging, crew members will need to live under field conditions in a fire camp situation as well providing their own food. The primary use of the helicopters will be aerial ignition using plastic sphere dispensing (PSD), with PSD equipment furnished by the government.  Secondary uses may include recon/observation, fire suppression, and transport of personnel and equipment throughout the region supporting other projects and fires.  In the event that the prescribed fire operations do not go on as planned, the flight time guarantee may be expended by supporting project and fire operations throughout the region. 2. Terms and Conditions a.	Aircraft Rental Agreement The resulting contract will be awarded by the issuance of a new contract incorporating the operator's Aircraft Rental Agreement.  Terms and conditions for that agreement including all commercial item clauses and provisions, as well as Supplements 1 and 2 shall apply unless otherwise specified herein.  Operators that do not currently have an Aircraft Rental Agreement must be capable of meeting the requirements of this agreement.  The agreement can be found at http://amd.nbc.gov/west/fcc/ara-toc-w.htm.  Information concerning the agreement can be obtained from Aviation Management at 208-334-9310. b.	Exclusive Use Period The exclusive use period shall start on the effective date established by a Notice to Proceed issued by the CO or authorized Government representative at least three days in advance of the start date.  As much prior notice as possible will be given when available. c.	Mutual Extension of Exclusive Use Period Upon mutual agreement by the parties, the CO will modify the contract to extend the exclusive use period on a day-to-day basis, either prior to the established starting date or subsequent to the ending date. The contract terms, conditions, specifications and prices shall apply to such extension. d.	Daily Availability During the exclusive use period and any extension, the Contractor shall be in compliance with all contract requirements and available and capable of providing service up to 14 hours each day, as scheduled by the Government.  Personnel shall be available a minimum of nine hours each day, or as scheduled by the Government.  Pre- and post-flight activities shall be accomplished within the 14- hour duty day.  Routine maintenance shall be performed before or after the scheduled 14-hour period, or as permitted elsewhere in the contract. e.	Unavailability and Damages The contractor will be unavailable when not in compliance with all contract requirements or are not capable of providing service as scheduled by the government.   Unavailability will continue until the contractor has notified the COR that they are available.   During periods of unavailability, the Government may obtain replacement services elsewhere and charge the Contractor for any resulting excess costs.  The Contractor may be liable for any additional actual damages to the Government resulting from such failure to perform.  f.   Extended Standby Extended standby is intended to provide the Contractor compensation for employee time when ordered services are provided in excess of the first 9 hours of service.  Ordered standby shall not exceed individual crewmembers' daily duty limitations.  Extended standby is not intended to compensate the Contractor on a one-to-one basis for all hours necessary to service and maintain the aircraft.   The Government will measure extended standby in full hours and will round up to the next whole hour, not to exceed each crewmember's duty limitations specified in Section B of the ARA.  Payment for extended standby will be made at the prices set forth in Section 4 below, and as measured above.  If unavailability occurs, extended standby will be measured and paid only for full hours of service provided. g.  Clauses incorporated by reference (thru Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-24) 52.245-1  Government Property Clauses can be found at http://acquisition.gov/far/index.html h.  Guarantee The total hourly guarantee specified in Section 4 will be reduced by 3 flight hours for each day, or portion thereof, that service is listed as unavailable.

STATEMENT OF WORK

History of Biology and the NSF Circa 1975 to 2004

1. BACKGROUND

The National Science Foundation is among the leading scientific organizations in the post-World War II United States, and the history of the NSF and the histories of specific science and engineering disciplines in this country are intertwined.  In 2000, The Johns Hopkins University Press published Toby A. Appel?s Shaping Biology: The National Science Foundation and American Biological Research, 1945-1975.  The NSF is seeking a successor volume.

2. SCOPE 

The contractor shall provide non-personal services for the preparation of a scholarly monograph on the History of Biology and the NSF 1975 to 2004. The monograph must be completed in manuscript form, accepted by the NSF Historian and the Assistant Director for Biology (AD/BIO), and ready for negotiation with a publisher within 36 months after date of award.  

The monograph shall provide an accurate, complete, interpretive, and readable history, which shall be accessible to non-specialist readers. It should communicate the contributions of the NSF to American and world science, illuminate the process by which those contributions came to be, and provide a contextual account of past policy successes and failures. 

The final version of the manuscript must be publishable. This means that the quality shall be good enough to pass a rigorous historical and technical peer review process.

The contractor shall carry out the work under the direction of the NSF Historian who is responsible for the overall history of the agency.  

3. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF SUBJECT MATTER

This project is an intellectual and institutional history, documenting and evaluating the impact of NSF funding on the development of the biological sciences since 1975. The time period for the study is from the end point of Toby A. Appel?s Shaping Biology: The National Science Foundation and American Biological Research, 1945-1975, to February 2004.

The study should focus on at least three major issues:

(1) In 1975, the Division of Biological and Medical Sciences was disbanded, and a new Directorate of Biological, Behavioral, and Social Sciences was established. The claim made by the NSF administration was that bringing together these diverse fields under one umbrella would lead to the interaction, branching, and convergence of disciplines to produce new, hybrid disciplines. Did this actually occur? What was the impact on biology of the later removal of the social and behavioral sciences from the directorate?
(2) In the 1975 reorganization, biomedical research was removed from the NSF. How did this action impact the support of biological research at the NSF and the growth of General Medical Sciences at the National Institutes of Health?
(3) How did the NSF respond to, assist and promote the changing nature of biology during these years? When the NSF chose to intervene in the field, how successful was it?

In analyzing these issues, as well as other issues the contractor deems important for gaining an understanding of the history of biology and the NSF, the contractor should consider the larger contexts of biological research being supported and conducted under auspices other than the NSF, federal support for science more generally, and the administrative history of the NSF.

4. PROCEDURES FOR HISTORICAL RESEARCH

The contractor shall be familiar with the general history of science and use this background knowledge to construct and present an innovative, intellectually challenging argument that is accessible to scholars, policymakers, and the general public.

The contractor shall perform primary archival research, read appropriate published reports, and interview key participants. The contractor shall be responsible for identifying appropriate illustrations and photographs for this book and obtaining permission. Illustrations and photographs shall be used only as appropriate to explain issues raised in the written work.

Primary documentation for this study is located at the NSF in Arlington, Virginia, National Archives II in College Park, Maryland, and the Washington National Records Center in Suitland, Maryland. Other documentation may exist in the papers of former NSF staff members and NSF grant recipients.

NSF will make available to the contractor for use in the project all agency records relevant to the work.

 HSAR 3052.209?70  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES (JUN 2006).
 
    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)? 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held? 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.     The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.       OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.           Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman:  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.           In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.   If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.   Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.     The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.     To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).   Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-APO-1), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters

<DESC>Description
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12 and 13, as supplemental with additional information included in this notice.
 
This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Quotations are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation Number SB134108RQ0121 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541712 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This requirement is restricted and only small businesses contractors may submit a quote. 

The following is the Statement of Work:

Background

The Scanning Electron Microscopy with Polarization Analysis (SEMPA) facility at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland requires new sample preparation procedures that will enable imaging magnetic nanostructures found in difficult-to-clean, but technologically important materials.  Some examples of these materials are magnetic oxides, multiferroics, metallic films that are only a few atomic layers thick, and multilayers composed of ultrathin films. These new materials are used in recent technological advances that enable manipulating magnetism and spin in nanoscale devices. As part of our ongoing Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) nanomagnetics program, we have an immediate need to be able to use SEMPA to image magnetic nanostructures in samples composed of these novel materials in order to support advances in the spintronics and magneto-electronics industries.  Our SEMPA measurements require samples with atomically clean surfaces, which we currently obtain by sputtering with several-hundred-volt argon ions.  Ion sputtering, however, can cause significant damage to this latest generation of nanos-tructured magnetic materials and thus cannot be used.  We therefore require development of new sample cleaning techniques that do not damage the delicate materials we intend to use.  Furthermore, these techniques must be able to be implemented in a custom cleaning chamber constructed as an extension of the existing SEMPA instrument.  Design and construction of this chamber requires full knowledge and understanding of the principles, operation, and environmental requirements of the NIST SEMPA technique.
