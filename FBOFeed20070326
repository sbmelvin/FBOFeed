<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Portland, Oregon, has a requirement to complete construction of infiltration gallery #3, which was partially constructed in 2004.  Since this time frame, all necessary permitting and water rights have been established. At the time of initial construction, funding was not available to complete the collection lines which feed the gallery sump. The water right and the pump are designed to produce 4500 gpm or 10 cfs of quality groundwater for fish rearing at the facility; however the collection lines need to be completed in order to attain such flows. Scope of work includes but may not be limited excavating three trenches at the level of each of three collection lines (approximately 14 feet below the well casement top cap), extending approximately 100 feet in length on the center collection line, and 50 feet each on the lateral collection lines in a specified straight line (a total of 200 feet of new line). Trenches must be lined with drain rock to minimize intrusion of sand and silt. Connect new perforated pipe (12"diameter encased in filter sock) to the existing lines and install the new sections of collection line. Install a vertical inspection pipe (4" PVC) with a cap at the end of each collection line. Cover the collection line with filter cloth and drain rock and then backfill the area to its original contour with the surrounding grounds. Note: Divers may be required to connect pipe sections under water.  Project magnitude is between $25,000 and $100,000.  This will be"best value" procurement with award based on past performance with similar requirements and price. Past performance is significantly more important than price.  Solicitation number: 101817Q256 may be viewed thru a link to the National Business Center Interior Electronic Acquisition System-Electronic Commerce at "http://www.fedbizopps.gov" or "http://www.nbc.gov".  The solicitation response date will be approximately 21 days from posting date. No further notice will be posted on Fedbizopps.  For assistance in downloading information from the National Business Center contact the helpdesk at (703) 390-6633.   Interested contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and complete Online Representations and Certifications (ORCA) at "http://www.bpn.gov".  Work to be completed at Winthrop National Fish Hatchery, 453A Twin Lakes Rd., Winthrop, Washington 98862.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR 342) is soliciting pre-proposals and proposals in the following topic area within the Naval Warrior Applications program.  This program includes basic research and applied research components.

Undersea Medicine.  The field of Undersea Medicine covers a broad area of research topics in need of multidisciplinary approaches to understanding basic mechanisms and developing solutions.  Investigators in such research disciplines as molecular biology, immunology, biochemistry, physiology, stress physiology, environmental physiology, neuroscience, psychology, computational fluid dynamics, and others are invited and encouraged to bring their expertise to bear on the issues outlined below.  The goal of this effort is to encourage new thinking that will lead to the elucidation of the physiological and biochemical (molecular) mechanisms underlying the effects of stressors experienced by Navy and Marine Corps divers and Navy submarine personnel. Research proposals in the following areas are requested:

1) studies of the pathophysiology of decompression sickness (DCS) and arterial gas embolism (AGE), with an emphasis on characterizing a) cellular (gene activation) and molecular (enzymes, receptors or signaling systems) interactions with nitrogen gas emboli, b) how these interactions influence DCS/AGE risk (including molecular and cellular pathology), c) methods to improve prediction and diagnosis of DCS/AGE using non-invasive imaging techniques and/or by use of specific cellular and molecular processes, d) improved therapeutic (non-recompressive) interventions to mitigate DCS and AGE, e) novel methods to remove excess gases from tissues and f) greater understanding of how exposure to thermal stress can influence DCS risk, f) mathematical modeling of fluid dynamics that may influence DCS incidence;

2) studies to elucidate the cellular (gene activation) and molecular (enzymes, receptors or signaling systems) pathology of hyperbaric oxygen toxicity (HBO) to include:  a) determination of those specific perturbations of metabolic processes by hyperbaric oxygen that are demonstrably and causally related to HBO (using the tools of metabolomics, proteomics, and genomics, and leading to a functional understanding of these responses at the molecular and cellular level), b) molecular and cellular details of the pathology associated with HBO, c) studies to develop prophylactic therapeutics for HBO toxicity (e.g., central nervous system, pulmonary, and ocular pathology) and d) methods to detect in real time the development of oxidative injury in situ;

3) studies to elucidate the acute effects of heat and cold stress on performance as well as the physiologic adaptive mechanisms to heat and cold stress, including the mechanisms of these responses at the cellular (gene activation) and molecular (enzymes, receptors and signaling systems) level;

4) studies on the effects of high and low frequency sound on human divers at the organism, organ, cellular, and molecular levels;
            
5) studies on the identification and mitigation of operational stressors, including an understanding of these stressors at the molecular, cellular and pharmacologic level, experienced by submariners, including technologies to improve operator performance in submarines in the littoral battle space and to improve the survival of submariners during submarine rescue operations;

6) studies on the management of trauma in the undersea environment;

7) studies in the area of diving medicine such as fitness to dive, longitudinal medical effects, barotraumas and immersion stress;

8) studies of high pressure nervous syndrome (HPNS) at the organism, organ, cellular and molecular level.

In order to foster the development of young investigators in the field, up to two of the awards under this program may be Postdoctoral Awards (see  paragraph 7 -  Instrument Type(s) for details).  Pre-proposals and Proposals submitted designated as “Postdoctoral” will be evaluated (using the same criteria as Primary Awards) as a separate category.  Available funds not applied to Postdoctoral Awards will be applied to Primary Awards. 

It is not the intent of this solicitation to establish new facilities; investigators should be able to demonstrate that they have the required research capability and access to the necessary facilities.  Pre-proposals and proposals whose main objectives are to conduct analyses, literature reviews, or program evaluations are not encouraged.

<DESC>This is a presolicitaion notice for Department of Treasury, OCC, Group Life Insurance.  The OCC is seeking an experienced and qualified Contractor to underwrite and administer its group term life insurance program for its active and retired employees and their eligible dependents.  OCC employees have the choice of electing coverage under the federal government through their life insurance program known as the Federal Government Life Insurance (FEGLI) program and/or through OCC’s own program known as OCC Group Life Insurance (OCC Group Life).  Employees can also elect to waive coverage under both life insurance programs.
OCC Group Life currently consists of basic life insurance coverage and three types of optional life insurance coverage options.  Refer to Exhibit 3 for a detailed description of the OCC Group Life Insurance Program.  The OCC and employees share in the cost of the premiums for basic life insurance, however, employees are responsible for the entire cost of any optional coverage that is elected.  The employee-share of insurance premiums is deducted from their biweekly pay on an after-tax basis.  OCC Group life does not include a disability waiver extension. 

All pre-existing conditions and illnesses are to be covered for currently enrolled employees and retirees, where applicable. Enrolled participants shall be immediately eligible for the plan upon its effective date.   

A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS WILL BE POSTED ON/BEFORE APRIL 1, 2007.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center San Diego (SSC-SD) intends to procure on a full and open competition basis research and development services to design and prototype Small Antenna Systems (SAS) units for use with GPS receivers. Due to space constraints, current rotary-wing military platforms utilize GPS antenna systems with no inherent jamming resistance. The program objective is to increase the GPS jamming immunity available to these platforms by developing one or more anti-jam antenna system solutions to accommodate the differing installation requirements of the various end- users. The SAS must be backward-compatible with the existing user equipment for the intended platform(s). SSC-SD anticipates issuing multiple completion type contracts in support of this effort. The expected funding is several million dollars for a multi-year program that is intended to develop production representative units. A survey of the industry response to an SAS RFI in Aug 2006 suggests that the most favorable end-to-end solutions may not reside with a single vendor. Therefore, company teaming is encouraged to exploit the promising antenna or signal processing technologies of separate firms in common system-level solutions. Access to portions of the solicitation resulting from this announcement shall require a facility clearance of secret.  Interested parties lacking a secret facility clearance will not have access to all specifications under this project. Therefore, SSC-SD requests that potential offerors submit the following information to the SSC-SD contracts negotiator: Company Name; Address of business unit proposed; company cage code.  This information will be used to verify that interested parties are permitted access to all specifications prior to solicitation issuance.  The Contracting Officer has determined the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) number for this procurement to be 541710.  An Industry Day is scheduled for 08-09 May 2007. The Industry Day agenda and visit request information are posted on the SPAWAR E- Commerce Central (E-CC)website https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil/. Permission to attend Industry Day is contingent upon prior government approval and notification thereof to potential attendees. Companies planning to attend Industry Day are requested to do the following: â–ª No later than 2 weeks after the date of this announcement, provide response affirming Industry Day attendance to Ms. Oralee Martin, SSC-SD contracts negotiator, e-mail address: oralee.martin@navy.mil ; phone: 619-553-5347. â–ª No later than 2 weeks after the date of this announcement, provide notification to Ms. Martin, SSC-SD of your firm's intent to conduct a presentation of your firm's products and capabilities to other industry participants on 08 May 2007 per the schedule described in the Industry Day agenda . The presentation is to be at a level appropriate for public release. Participation is on a voluntary basis and will have no bearing on a future contract award. â–ª No later than 2 weeks after the date of this announcement, provide notification to Ms. Martin, SSC-SD of your firms intent to participate in a one-on- one discussion session with the government on 09 May 2007 per the schedule described in the Industry Day agenda. Attendees are encouraged to submit written questions in advance to Ms. Martin, SSC-SD to facilitate efficient use of the allotted discussion time. â–ª No later than 3 weeks after the date of this announcement, provide visit request/visit details per the instructions posted on the E-CC website (limit of three attendees per company).

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Information (OSRTI), has a requirement for a service contract to present training courses under its Environmental Response Training Program.  The EPA will provide training facilities located in Edison, NJ, Erlanger, KY and Las Vegas, NV.  Some courses may take place in these locations and some courses will take place at other locations throughout the country.  The space for any given course may be provided by the government, or the contractor may be required to obtain space.  The contractor will not be required to operate the facilities in Edison, NJ, Erlanger, KY, or Las Vegas, NV, but may be asked to maintain a presence of one or more employees in one or more of these locations. The contractor will be responsible for managing and directing the ERTP program, presenting existing courses, developing and presenting new courses and providing professional instructors and auxiliary staff needed to operate the program.  The training program includes training topics involving health and safety, and technical operations related to hazard sampling, detection, identification, evaluation, control, and decontamination.  The contractor will also be required to support EPA?s increasing responsibility related to domestic preparedness which involves the development and delivery of training courses related to the response to a deliberate release of toxic materials. The government anticipates awarding two cost plus fixed-fee level of effort (LOE) contracts for this requirement from one solicitation.  One will be a small business set-aside and will have a two (2) year base period and three (3), one (1) year award terms for a maximum potential period of performance of five (5) years.  The second procurement will be subject to full and open competition and will have a three (3) year base period and two (2), two (2) year award terms for a maximum potential period of performance of seven (7) years.  The government anticipates including quantity options in both procurements, which if exercised, would increase the base LOE within any given contract year.   The government anticipates that the small business contractors will be responsible for conducting the health and safety courses which include the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 40 hour and 8 hour Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response Standard (HAZWOPER) courses as currently delivered by the EPA.  The EPA course descriptions can be accessed at www.ertpvu.org, course name Hazardous Materials Incident Response to Operations.  The remaining courses will be conducted under the full and open contract.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 541620. The RFP, amendments, and all other information related to these requirements will be posted on FedBizOpps and the EPA's Office of Acquisition Management website, at the following URL: http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/index.htm#solam.  It is anticipated that the RFP will be posted in June 2007. All information related to these procurements will be available at the link indicated above through the date of contract award.  The estimated award date is on or about January 31, 2008.  Award will be made on a best value basis with technical being of greater importance than cost/price.

<CONTACT>Anthony Wimbush, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-418-0932, Fax 202-418-0237, Email awimbush@fcc.gov
<DESC>This synopsis is a Thousands-Blocks Pooling Administration requirement. This synopsis is prepared in accordance with FAR Subparts 5.2 and 6.3. The synopsis serves to give notice of the Government’s intent to negotiate and issue a sole source bridge contract in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302-1 entitled “Only One Responsible Source and No Other supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements. This bridge contract is necessary to provide a continuation of critical services until the ongoing recompetition of the pooling administration services requirement is completed. Pooling administration services are critical to preventing the exhaustion of numbering resources in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) and must therefore be provided without interruption. Interruption of pooling administration services would result in a more rapid depletion of numbering resources nationwide and a return to the near-crisis state of the NANP that existed prior to implementation of pooling administration. The requirement obligates the contractor to serve as an independent designated entity responsible for administering Thousands-Block number pools by assigning, managing, forecasting, reporting and processing data that will allow service providers in rate areas designated for Thousands-Block number pooling to receive telephone numbers in blocks of 1,000. Thousands-Block number pooling is a resource optimization strategy which enables carriers to receive telephone numbers in blocks of 1,000, rather than 10,000, thereby promoting a more efficient and effective use of numbering resources. The Government intends to award a sole source bridge contract to NeuStar, Inc., the incumbent contractor. NeuStar, Inc. has been providing the critical, highly specialized services described above to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) since 2001. The existing contract is scheduled to expire on April 14, 2007. The transition period from the incumbent to a new service provider is anticipated to last several months. Due to the considerable transition period anticipated, the FCC has determined that only on contractor – NeuStar, Inc. – is capable of meeting the critical need for uninterrupted continuation of the pooling administration services for an interim period until completion of the ongoing recompetition. Accordingly, award to any other source other than NeuStar, Inc. would result in an unacceptable interruption in fulfilling FCC mission requirements and could severely jeopardize the success of continuing to generate and implement the program as required by statute. While it may be technically possible for other companies to provide the required services after a considerable transition period, the FCC believes that no contractor other than NeuStar, Inc. is capable of providing interim services beginning April 15, 2007 until the ongoing recompetition is completed. Pooling Administration must continue to be provided without interruption. Services are to cover a three-month period of performance with options for two, one-month periods of performance. Award is anticipated prior to April 11, 2006. Interested vendors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by addressing how it would be able to perform the interim services from April 15, 2007 until the ongoing recompetition is completed.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all capability statements received within 15 calendar days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the FCC. A determination by the FCC not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the FCC. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A presolicitation announcement of the recompetition requirement was publicized on May 8, 2006. Interested vendors must contact Tony Wimbush, Contract Specialist, FCC/Contracts & Purchasing Center, @ 202-418-0932 or via email @ anthony.wimbush @fcc.gov.

This is a Pre-Solicitation Synopsis; not a request for competitive proposals.  The purpose of this program is to expand the photovoltaic solar cell ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) encapsulant manufacturing industry to include the processing and production of EVA encapsulant materials to be used in the development and manufacture of photovoltaic solar cells.  The Title III Program Office, Air Force Research Laboratory, Manufacturing Technology Division (AFRL/MLM) intends to award an Assistance Instrument or a contract, as appropriate, on the basis of less than full and open competition for this requirement to Specialized Technology Resources, Inc., 10 Water Street, Enfield, CT 06082.  Under the authority of Title III of the Defense Production Act (DPA) (50 U.S.C. App. Section 2061 et seq.), the Title III Program Office is contemplating this procurement for photovoltaic EVA encapsulant manufacturing to scale up capacity for critical defense applications and technologies.  The period of performance for the procurement is anticipated to be 18 months.  A description of the task is as follows: 1) procurement and installation of a new thin film EVA encapsulant production machine to support capacity expansion, 2) deliver a detailed strategic business plan that formally assesses and verifies the military and commercial demand for photovoltaic EVA encapsulant manufacturing, and 3) expand domestic capabilities for photovoltaic EVA encapsulant materials coupled with production.  The ability of the offeror to accomplish the goals of the program will be assessed based upon the offeror’s demonstrated leadership in the industry and the offeror’s production capacity capability to produce up to 400 megawatts (MW) annually.  The offeror shall have the ability to provide all key aspects of the photovoltaic EVA encapsulant manufacturing to include process flow (blending, extrusion, thickness control, web slitting, roll winding).  In addition, the offeror shall demonstrate an ability and willingness to meet the challenges of successfully developing production for evolving DoD requirements.  These challenges include (a) identification, analysis and evaluation of the enabling technologies and (b) reduction of cycle-time and costs for photovoltaic EVA encapsulant production.  Additional phases to establish, maintain, or expand a photovoltaic EVA encapsulant manufacturing capability may be awarded, and will be based on defense requirements, anticipated demand, and availability of funding.  The government intends to issue an award for these requirements on a Sole Source basis per FAR 6.302-1(a)(1), Only One Responsible Source or DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations 37.400(b), based upon their domestic R&D activity and on their experience as a merchant industrial supplier providing leading edge technology, as well as an assessment of the program risk to the Government.  Offerors who are capable of providing the services stated above shall fully identify their interest and submit, in writing, information documenting their qualifications and capabilities to meet the requirements stated above within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  This documentation shall specify the offerors area of expertise and experience.  It shall include a demonstrated capability to manufacture photovoltaic solar cell EVA encapsulant material.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Technology Transfer (OTT) is soliciting contractual support to provide patent-related services including patent searches, patent prosecution, infringement and interference services and licensing consultation.  Pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act (FTTA), the NIH has a significant program in patenting and licensing inventions with commercial potential.  The OTT currently handles patent prosecution for the NIH and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  From time to time, it will also administer technologies for other Federal agencies.  It is expected that OTT will seek to file 200-300 patent applications each year.  Our active patent prosecution docket is in excess of 1,300 cases.  As would be expected in the world?s largest biomedical research institution, the inventions claimed in our patent portfolio fall generally into the following research categories:  biological response modifiers, cancer, HIV/AIDS, infectious disease, general medicine, bioinstrumentation, software, and research tools.  However, there are three categories of technology for which patent prosecution services will be required- biology, chemistry, and mechanical/electrical/software.  In addition, ancillary patent prosecution related services, related to Contested Proceedings and Licensing Consultation may encompass any of the research categories.
The period of performance of this contract shall be for one year (12 months), with options renewable for nine (9) additional 12 month periods. This is a competitive procurement using full and open competition. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 541110 with a size standard of $6.5 million. The Government anticipates a multiple award, IDIQ type contract. Solicitation 263-2006-P(GM)-0247 will be made available on the Federal Business Opportunities website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

<DESC>General Services Administration (GSA) Lease No. LCO13671 provides 33,405 rentable square feet of contiguous office and five (5) reserved parking spaces for Government vehicles.  GSA is interested in considering alternative space if relocation is economically advantageous to the Government.  The agency will require an additional 4,000 rentable square feet for a total of approximately 37,405 rentable square feet.  In making such a determination, GSA will consider cost factors including, but not limited to, the total cost of the physical move (including telecommunications and computer cabling costs); tenant improvement costs (whether included in the rent or compensated separately from the rent); and anticipated rent for the space.  Of particular importance is space configuration to support a sophisticated IT infrastructure.  Proximity to employee services, such as moderately priced restaurants, banks, public transportation, and a fitness center, as well as hotel accommodations for visitors is also necessary.  Other factors impacting the Government?s rights under a prospective lease, such as the length of any firm term that may be required at an alternative location, length of time necessary to deliver occupancy-ready space, and the right to terminate any space vacated during the term, will also bear.

Space must be located in Lakewood, Colorado and within these boundaries:  North-Highway 285; South-West Mansfield Avenue, East-S. Pierce St.; and West-Wadsworth Blvd.  Space must meet the Federal Government's standards for fire safety, be capable of being fully accessible to the physically challenged, and be located outside a 100-year floodplain.  Space must be ready for occupancy on July 1, 2007 or sooner.  A lease term of 10 years with a firm term of 5 years is sought.  

Brokers or agents may represent the prospective landlord, but any properties or proposals submitted by brokers/agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized to represent the building?s ownership.  If you desire to submit a location for inspection, please forward information by 5:00 PM EDT, April 2, 2007.  Expressions of interest should include building name and address, location of space in the building, rentable square feet offered and rentable rate per square foot (specifying services and utilities included), ANSI/BOMA defined usable square feet, percentage of common area factor used to determine the rentable square feet, one-eighth inch scale drawing of space offered, and contact information for owner or authorized agent.

<DESC>The Major Programs Team in the Support Equipment and Vehicles Contracting Office (GBKBB) within the 642d Combat Sustainment Group (CBSG) is responsible for procuring Computerized Radiography (CR) digital imaging systems for Nondestructive Inspections (NDI) in military aircraft maintenance environments. The imaging systems will detect abnormalities, stress areas, and other such physical findings in a variety of metallic and non-metallic aircraft products.

The Radiography Digital system, uses photostimulable phosphor imaging plates as the collection media for radiographic data. The system operates in the same fashion as x-ray films used for the purpose of NDI evaluation, except that the phosphors are capable of being erased and re-used. An automated programmable method of extracting the data and subsequently erasing the phosphors and a method for displaying and storing the images shall be provided by the contractor.

The solicitation will contain a line item for a first production unit and associated testing. As the system is commercial and of the type commonly found in metallurgy laboratories and precision machining facilities in the private as well as public sector, the testing will be minimal and will serve to confirm that the system adheres to the requirements of the Purchase Description. 

Request for Proposal Components:  It is expected that a Performance-Price Tradeoff (PPT) will be utilized to evaluate potential offerors.  The RFP will provide full instructions and evaluation criteria.  The resultant contract is expected to be a 3-year, requirements type contract, with one basic year and 2 Option Years.  The basic year will include Pre-Production Units (one Type I and one Type II) and associated Data line items.

<DESC>This acquisition is for a firm fixed-price contract consisting of a base period for one unit. The base period will be approximately six months in length. The requirement is to repair and refurbish one empennage platform (hereinafter referred to as the tail stand) designed to service the tail components of C-5A aircraft.  The tail stand shall be brought to fully functional condition as per original design specifications.  The tail stand is a 70-ton (approximate), 70-foot tall, self-propelled lattice structure comprised of square tubing weldments.  The main structural members are four leg columns joined by bolting to structural fixed deck supports.  The structure is arranged to envelop the tail of the aircraft and provide six work levels, all connected by stairs and serviced by a 1000-pound capacity elevator.  The sixth work level provides access to the horizontal stabilizer.  Each work level consists of a fixed deck that houses a set of sliding deck panels that are manually pulled out to close the gap between the edge of the fixed deck and the vertical stabilizer.  The stand is also equipped with a 1000-pound capacity jib crane, a 1000-pound capacity traveling hoist on an I-beam, and four stabilizing jacks. The tail stand is supported by four two-wheel axles: two fixed axles are powered by a hydrostatic drive, and two steered axles are un-powered.  A 107 HP, 2800-RPM gasoline engine provides the power to drive and steer the stand at 2 mph in still air and at a slower speed against 40 mph wind. The nominal working pressure of the hydraulic system is 2000 psi.  When in position around the tail, the elevator, jib crane, and the hoist are powered through an electric cable from the hangar power source.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research and Naval Sea Systems Command are issuing a Request for Information (RFI) and scheduling an Industry Workshop to fulfill the requirements set forth below.  The Chief of Naval Operations has directed the Naval Sea Systems Command to evaluate the Navy need for emerging Integrated Power System technologies and to guide the development and transition of technology to the fleet.  The Navy has developed and is in the process of deploying first generation Integrated Power Systems (IPS) on numerous ships classes.  Systems include full electric propulsion, such as DDG 1000 and T-AKE, partial electric propulsion, such as LHD-8, and mechanical propulsion ships with innovative electric mission systems such as CVN 78 and SSN 23.  The Navy is in the process of issuing contracts to four shipbuilders who will work interactively to evaluate the Navy’s open system architecture for the Next Generation Integrated Power System (NGIPS) and provide recommendations to maximize opportunities for common component development.  The shipbuilders will use the findings of the NGIPS Navy Working Groups and work under the Alternate Nuclear Power System (ANPS) to build upon the Navy’s architecture.   The contractor(s) will recommend changes to the Navy’s NGIPS technical architecture consisting of a functional description of a platform-independent system of power and propulsion modules suitable for application to the following Navy ship types, a surface combatant, a submarine, an expeditionary warfare ship, an aircraft carrier, and a littoral combat ship. Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command (COMNAVSEA), has chartered a Next Generation IPS (NGIPS) Flag Level Steering Board to provide guidance and oversight for NGIPS to support transformational warfighting through improved Integrated Power System technology while ensuring system commonality and the enabling of electric weapons and sensors.  This Flag board has directed that industry “buy-in” should be obtained for next generation IPS technical architectures and technology options.  The purpose of the Peer Review Team Workshop described below is to obtain industry and equipment supplier input to development of options for the Next Generation Integrated Power Systems technical architecture development.  The Office of Naval Research is gathering and evaluating information regarding current technologies and equipment, and research and development efforts underway having shipboard propulsion and power implications. Key areas of interest are energy conversion, electric propulsion, power conversion, power generation, power distribution and energy storage. This announcement requests concepts and data for systems and equipment that can populate Integrated Power and Weapon Systems alternative architectures.    This undertaking is expected to serve as part of the foundation for developing a roadmap for U.S. Navy propulsion power and energy science and technology and research and development. 
  
We request industry leaders and innovators across the spectrum to provide survey information for systems/equipment you are operating, manufacturing, or developing which could benefit the NGIPS ship technical architecture development as described.  Responses to this request for information should be submitted by March 30 using the form linked separately on this site. 
    
In addition to this request for a response for technical information, a Peer Review Team Workshop will be held on April 5-6, 2007, to allow all interested contractors, HM&E and combat system integrators and university representatives to respond to Navy-led briefings and discussions  and provide input to these NGIPS technical architecture studies in breakout sessions.  Many briefings to be presented at this event will be considered to fall under export control and  Distribution Statement "D" (Critical Technology) restrictions. Therefore only Department of Defense (DoD) and DoD contractor personnel who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents are authorized to attend.  The Navy’s desire is to obtain input from system integration firms and organizations possessing advanced component technology.  Any other U.S. requests shall be referred to the point of contact below.   Additional workshop information is provided below.  
  
This NGIPS Peer Review Team Workshop is scheduled for 5 and 6 April 2006 and will commence at 1200 hrs on April 5 and end at 1400 hrs on April 6.  This schedule is intended to follow the Sea-Air-Space Exposition 2007, which ends on April 5.

Also, in Section 2, Scope of Services reads: "CPAP/BIPAP Patients with No backup Rate will be visited 30 days after initial set up, 90 days later for compliance verification and then twice a year thereafter (with no more than 180 days from one evaluation to the next)."   Are these figures correct, since the schedule of visits exceeds the 1,200 total patients?  No.  Total oxygen patient visits increased to 1,600 as corrected in the scope of work, paragraph 2, page 19.  The Schedule of Supplies/Services, pages 6 through 18 corrected.

"The cost of backup systems, backup oxygen and backup equipment shall be borne by the contractor.  If H Tanks are used for backup, the contractor shall furnish an H Tank stand for each H Tank at no cost to the government."  Does the contractor will provide free backup on any VAMC oxygen concentrator property without receiving any reimbursement for it?  Yes. If so, if the contractor provides their own oxygen concentrator, can we charge VAMC for the backup provided to VAMC's patients? Yes. Does VAMC have a definition of Emergency Service? Can you provide us with a more specific definition? Emergency Services must be provided on continuous power failure, equipment malfunction and during natural disasters (hurricanes, floods, etc.).  Only refills will be paid.   Page 20, Sec 10 (c), Infection Control. Can VAMC provide us with a statistical report of the Home Oxygen Service patients, compromised with infectious diseases and if possible its classification? None.

Also, maintenance on equipment shall be done by a manufacturer's checklist.  Can VAMC provide us with the amount of concentrators servicing the 350 oxygen patients, brand and model?  Answer provided above.  In case contractor provides VAMC its own concentrators, we observe there is no provision for submitting rental prices in the II SCHEDULE OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES (BLOCK 20) spreadsheet.

Page 24, item 29(i). "The VA will provide the Contractor with two (2) owned computers ." Do the computers have an equipment tracking software? This requirement is deleted from the solicitation.  Page 28, item 50.1, "Disposable supplies." Can subsequent supplies be delivered by mail? Yes, but only if it's a replacement.

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the supplies and services described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above within 14 calendar days from the date of this synopsis.  The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, has a requirement for annual hardware and software maintenance and support on two (2) Leica Geosystems DSW700 and one (1) DSW600 digital scanning workstations.  This equipment must be maintained in full operating condition by certified Leica trained technicians in order to insure proper maintenance, and replacement parts and software updates must be compatible with existing Leica equipment.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 5.302-1, the Government considers the specified supplies and services as a sole source procurement from Leica Geosystems Geospatial Imaging LLC, 5051 Peach Tree Corner Circle, Norcross, Georgia, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required supplies and services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein.

<RESPDATE>041007
<ARCHDATE>04102007
<CONTACT>John E. Lynch john.e.lynch2@usmc.mil
<DESC>Naics Code: 335999 The government is seeking sources for procurement and delivery of bullet traps to capture projectiles from small arms, pistols up to .45 Cal and rifles up to 7.62mm, using standard service ammunition.  They are not intended for use with machine guns.  Two different types of bullet traps are required.  One type involves two permanent granulated rubber bullet traps to be installed on existing ranges.  The other type is a portable trap to be used in various shooting houses and SACON grenade houses.  The portable traps are to be delivered to various locations around the Marine Corps and used to mitigate the damage caused by repeated shooting on targets in a single location.   MCB Camp Butler requires two permanently installed bullet traps.  The first is to be installed on an existing rifle range to provide a granulated rubber impact medium for battle site zero (BZO) firing.  This course of fire is done with service rifles up to 7.62mm in which all firing is done from the prone position at short ranges.  The bullet trap would extend from ground level to a height of no more than four (4) vertical feet and extend approximately 200 feet to accommodate 25 shooters.  The bullet trap would be installed between the existing 200 and 300 yard lines on the Camp Hansen rifle range, oriented parallel to the firing lines.  All supporting structures must be hidden to prevent ricochets.  Measures would be necessary to prevent the impact media from migrating downward and must have a permeable cover to prevent the media from being blown away during Okinawa’s frequent typhoons, tropical storms and high winds.  Provisions for periodic filtering the expended bullets !  from the impact media would also be necessary. The second permanently installed bullet trap would be installed on an existing flat bay, walk-down pistol range located at Range 16 at Camp Hansen.  This range is currently using an earthen impact area and temporary targets that are installed as needed and then removed.  This bullet trap would be approximately 150 feet wide and extend from ground level to a vertical height of 12 feet.   Weapons used on this range include all small arms up to .45 caliber pistol, 7.62 mm rifle and 12 gauge shotgun, all at ranges of 50 meters and less.  All supporting structures must be hidden to prevent ricochets.  Measures would be necessary to prevent the impact media from migrating downward and must have a permeable cover to prevent the media from being blown away during Okinawa’s frequent typhoons, tropical storms and high winds.  Provisions for periodic filtering the expended bullets from the impact media would also be necessary. The portable bullet traps must be capable of holding standard military “E” silhouettes which are 20” x 40”, and capturing projectiles from small arms weapons up to 7.62mm excluding machine guns.  They must be constructed to prevent ricochets to the greatest degree possible.  They must be mounted on wheels that allow for movement over bare earth, clay, gravel, wood or concrete.  They must be free-standing, moveable by no more than two people and require no special equipment for movement.  The portable bullet traps may be constructed of more than one piece to allow movement in pieces if weight precludes single piece construction.  They must be made of Brinell AR500 steel and covered with a material that allows the bullet to pass through and be captured after impacting the steel.  Support structures must be constructed so that they do not allow splash or ricochet fragments back on the shooter.  The portable bullet trap must be adjustable for heights of the target center 24 inch!  es above the ground to 60 inches above the ground.  Height adjustments must be simple, using ratchets and gears thus requiring no special tools.  The base of the portable bullet trap must permit the targets to be placed no farther than 18 inches from the wall.   At total of eighty (80) portable bullet traps will be procured and delivered FOB to the following locations and in the numbers shown:  MCB Quantico, twelve (12); MCB Hawaii, ten (10); MCB Butler, ten (10); MCB Pendleton, twenty-four (24) and MCB Lejeune, twenty-four (24). The anticipated delivery date will be 90 days after contract award.  This is not a request for quotations or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  It should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the US Government to issue a solicitation.  Any information provided to the Government in response to this announcement will become USMC property and will not be returned.  All proprietary or classified information will be treated appropriately.  Written response is requested within 15 days after publication of this notice. No phone calls will be accepted.

<CONTACT>John E. Lynch john.e.lynch2@usmc.mil
<DESC>NAICS Code: 335999: The government is seeking sources for purchasing and installing live fire shoot houses for the conduct of urban training; two at MCB Camp Pendleton CA and one at MCB Hawaii Kaneohe Bay HI.   The shoot houses must provide complex, realistic yet safe training facility for the conduct of live fire shooting using small arms with occasional smoke and concussion grenades.  They must provide for 360 degree bullet containment using AR500 hardness steel of at least 3/8 inch thickness.  Joints must be completed without creating ricochet hazards.  The surfaces must be covered with a material to capture all splash created by impact of bullets on steel.   They must be two story structures with at least two stairways to the upper level.  Stairs must be constructed of material durable enough to support the weight of five fully loaded Marines simultaneously.  The bottom floor must contain at least five individual rooms and a complex hallway.  It must contain small spaces to simulate closets and bathrooms.  The upper level must have at least three rooms and a hallway.  Room sizes may vary but not be smaller than 8 feet x 10 feet except for the closets.  Exterior doors must be br!  eachable and have frames that are stable enough to withstand multiple manual, explosive and mechanical breaches.  Windows are not desired.  Enclosed spaces must have ventilation equipment to evacuate toxic gases and smoke.  Floors must be of a material that is non-combustible for use with smoke grenades and be solid enough to permit movement of portable bullet traps on wheels.  The layout for the three shoot houses need not be identical but may be adapted to the specific site that will be used.  The site for this temporary training facility will have a level ground condition, and the supplier will be required to provide a packed earth/dross pad where the training structure is to be erected.  This structure must meet the current guidelines for existing earthquake specs.  All buildings are to be considered non-inhabitable and temporary.  The anticipated delivery date will be 90 days after contract award.  This is not a request for quotations or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  It should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the US Government to issue a solicitation.  Any information provided to the Government in response to this announcement will become USMC property and will not be returned.

<CONTACT>John E. Lynch john.e.lynch2@usmc.mil
<DESC>NAICS Code: 335999: The government is seeking sources for an urban breach facility for the School of Infantry at Camp Pendleton CA.  The School of Infantry provides training for entry level Marines in addition to hosting several advanced infantry courses to include the Squad Leaders’ Course and Sergeants Course.  All of these training curricula include teaching the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) for breaching doors and windows in an urban setting.  Currently, these TTPs are taught using locally fabricated doors and windows that require purchase of materials on the open market at considerable expense.  Because of this expense, the TTPs are taught using the demonstration method vice giving the Marines actual, hands-on experience.  This contract would purchase door and window frames that can support multiple repetitions of breaches at much reduced recurring cost, allow for significantly more breaches per class and significantly improve the training provided to better prepare our Marines!   for urban combat.  This contract would require the vendor to deliver a variety of products to use as training aids for the various breaching techniques on different types of doors.  Both metal and wood doors would be required for training.  The breaching techniques include ram breaching, pry breaching, and explosives breaching and each have peculiar requirements for repetitive training.  The doors are to be supported by portable steel leg stands that have a reusable door jamb for mounting doors and locksets.  They use low cost pins and dowels to replicate the locksets that provide for multiple breaches before requiring the actual door to be replaced.  Windows have similar portable leg stands that are breached by using mechanical means.  The window simulators make use of a frame that can be mounted on the side of a building or onto a portable stand.  The window trainer must secure the window glass so that after breaking the glass, the shards must still be swept completely for a clean entry.  Al!  l doors must be reinforced and rigged with low cost, replaceable components at the key locations for repetitive use without replacing the actual door. The following list of training aids would be included in the contract: Breaching door leg stands (15) Explosive breaching doors (5) Ram breaching doors (5) Pry breaching doors (5) Breaching window kits (5) Wood frame, metal frame, reinforced and explosive pins (500) Wood fillers for pry doors (125) The anticipated delivery date will be 30 days after contract award.  This is not a request for quotations or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  It should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the US Government to issue a solicitation.  Any information provided to the Government in response to this announcement will become USMC property and will not be returned.  All proprietary or classified information will be treated appropriately.  Written response is requested within 15 days after publication of this notice. No phone calls will be accepted.

To ensure the continued use and protection of the Rancho Santa Margarita Ranch House Complex and the Las Flores Adobe Ranch House, Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton (MCB-CP) is seeking a qualified partner(s) to assist in the development of economically viable uses of the property by generating income from grants, fees, donations, or other sources of income; and in the management, operation, conservation, preservation, and rehabilitation of the properties in accordance with Secretary of the Interior Standards for Historic Properties. It is intended that under a partnering agreement, the above services will become financially self-sustaining within the next 10 years as MCB-CP reduces its financial responsibilities and the management and operating partner(s) increase their own contributions. Regulatory oversight responsibilities under the National Historic Preservation Act and the Archaeological Resource Protection Act will remain with the Marine Corps. Negotiation of the required implementing agreement documents with the California State Historic Preservation Officer will be the responsibility of the Marine Corps.

Description: The NSN for the MJU-51A/B Decoy is 1370-01-468-6077.  The MJU-51A/B infrared countermeasure decoy is an aluminum cartridge case purged with nitrogen and containing a payload of stacked special material elements that react with air.  Each aluminum cartridge case contains a sealed receptacle cup with an O-ring for an impulse cartridge, a plastic/nylon piston, crimped and then sealed, with a metal end plate.  When the impulse cartridge is initiated by the firing pulse, the impulse cartridge receptacle cup frangible membrane ruptures.  Pressure inside the canister increases pushing on the piston and breaking the end cap seal deploying the special material payload in the air stream.  The special material payload reacts with the air generating infrared energy to decoy surface to air and air to air missiles.

<DESC>This announcement is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future.  No solicitation is available at this time.  The purpose of this synopsis is to identify small business organizations with requisite qualifications to provide the services stated herein. Based on capability statements received in response to this Sources Sought Announcement this acquisition may be solicited as a 100% small business set-aside.  All small business organizations (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, and SDVOSB) are encouraged to respond to this notice.  This requirement is assigned a code of 541710 in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), and the small business size standard for such requirements is 500 employees. 


The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)/NIH, seeks capability statements from interested and qualified potential sources to provide repository services for the National Children's Study. The support services being sought are related to the establishment and operation of a large repository to receive, store, process, and ship biological and environmental samples that will be collected throughout the study (as described below). It is anticipated that the repository will periodically distribute samples to laboratories at the direction of the Government. NICHD is seeking information on the capabilities and limitations of organizations interested in providing the services described below.

BACKGROUND 

The Children’s Health Act of 2000 authorized the NICHD and a consortium of other Federal Agencies to “…plan, develop, and implement a prospective cohort study, from birth to adulthood, to ...incorporate behavioral, emotional, educational, and contextual consequences to enable a complete assessment of the physical, chemical, biological, and psychosocial environmental influences of children's well-being.” That study is now known as the National Children's Study (NCS). Investigators in the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), including the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as well as at other Federal agencies, have begun to plan and implement this large study. The NCS will study the complex relationship between health and the environment for approximately 100,000 U.S. children and their families throughout the United States. Enrollment of subjects throughout the U.S. will begin before birth (and possibly before conception) and follow-up will continue at least until each child is 21 years of age. 

Study planners have identified the following child health areas as priorities for the NCS: pregnancy outcomes, neurodevelopment and behavior, injury, asthma, obesity, and physical development. As a result of the many study hypotheses being considered for the NCS, as well as the anticipation that other hypotheses will emerge during the course of the Study and afterward, millions of diverse biological specimens and environmental samples will be collected over the life of the project. Biological samples may include, but are not limited to, blood, urine, hair, nails, saliva, buccal cells, breast milk, placentas, umbilical cord, vaginal swabs, cord blood, and meconium. Environmental samples may include, but are not limited to, air sampling filters, water, bulk household dust (vacuum and floor wipes), mattress dust, floor mats, soil, and food.  Additionally, prepared ampulated environmental samples, such as digestates or extracts, and residual environmental samples may be required to be stored. 

Plans for a repository for the Study are evolving. Concepts being considered include shipping all samples directly from field sampling technicians to a central receiving repository where they will be processed, aliquotted and stored.  Periodically, at the direction of the government, the repository will send aliquots to the primary analytic and clinical laboratories. Alternatively, some samples may be shipped first to the primary analytic and clinical laboratories for analysis with remaining material sent to the main repository. The ability to store a fraction of the biological and of the environmental samples at a separate geographic location is required to mitigate the risk of sample loss in a disaster.

Given the long-term nature of the study, it will be important to assess the long-term integrity and analyte stability of the various samples. The repository will contribute to the development of standard operating procedures (SOPs) to conduct these assessments and will store, process, and ship specimens as necessary to support these efforts.	 

A support services contract is anticipated to be used for the National Children’s Study Sample Repository.  The repository shall be located in facilities owned or operated by the contractor with specific space allocated for purpose of this contract. The successful offeror shall possess the following qualifications and meet the following requirements at the time of proposal submission.

<SUBJECT>70 -- License Transfer Fee:  FAS OCIO Libra Upgrade
<DESC>This serves as a ?Notice of Intent? to award a sole source task order for license transfer fees for software related to a Clearpath mainframe system upgrade, pursuant to FAR 6.302-1.    The General Services Administration Federal Supply Service (FAS) Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) has a requirement for upgrades to their Unisys Clearpath mainframe systems.  The Unisys ClearPath hardware platform is proprietary to and only available through Unisys Corporation.  The current generation ClearPath model, the Libra 185 is nearing the end of its practical life. In FY2008, the license term for which the ClearPath software was acquired will expire, and mainframe activity will cease. For a short period of time, GSA would be able to extend the life of this model, by renewing the licensing for those software components which remained supported on the platform. Eventually, however, all software would become unsupported. The hardware itself would also become unsupported, and spare parts to replace worn or damaged components would become difficult to obtain and expensive. Patches for security, contingency (such as ?Daylight Savings Time? changes), and bug fixes would become more difficult to obtain, and might require custom contracting to acquire.
It is essential that all hardware and software which supports the FAS applications be certified to support ClearPath systems and that they be installed in a manner which supports the ClearPath.  The substantial improvement of continuity of operations of this critical computing environment is closely aligned with the identified goal of FAS to provide system uptime in excess of 99 percent.  The purchase of the upgrades will allow FAS to meet these uptime goals in the face of disaster of the primary ClearPath system in Eagan MN, by activating a synchronized replicate in Salt Lake City UT.  The procurement includes $28,956.00 in Open Market Software, including license transfer fees for:  Asgard Open A ($9,545.00); Decision Support USRA Suite ($8,523), Locum Safe & Secure ($13,225); Turing Coms Monitoring Facility ($1,814).  The total open market license transfer fees for all packages is $44,063.  There would be no savings realized by purchasing each item separately, as the cost of new purchases (rather than a transfer fee) would be significantly higher.  Conversion of the existing applications to a different operating environment would cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling the requirements and mission of FAS OCIO.  In addition, this is a turn-key requirement.  This Sole Source Justification is being posted in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  All interested parties should request additional information, communicate concerns, or direct any questions concerning this acquisition to Holly Carr 202-329-7250, email:  holly.carr@gsa.gov.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals, nor a solicitation for offers.  It does not guarantee obligation or award.

<SUBJECT>A -- Wireless Network after Next (WNaN) Adaptive Network Development (WAND) API Technical Interchange Meeting (TIM)
<DESC>Wireless Network after Next (WNaN) Adaptive Network Development (WAND) API Technical Interchange Meeting (TIM)

DARPA will host a Network API Technical Interchange Meeting (TIM) in support of the Wireless Network after Next (WNaN) Adaptive Network Development (WAND) effort on 10 April 2007 at Marriott Crystal Gateway, 1700 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202; beginning at 8 a.m. and lasting until 5:00 p.m.  The main focus of the TIM will be presentation / review of the WANN wireless node Network Application Program Interfaces (APIs).  The Government is providing this opportunity for potential WAND bidders to get insight into the WANN performers’ approaches to the Network APIs to support development of WAND proposals that are maximally applicable to all WANN node suppliers.  During the morning session each WANN developer will present details of their Network API designs.  The formal TIM presentations will end at noon.  In the afternoon session there will be optional 20-minute time slots during which organizations that intend to be a prime bidder in response to the WAND BAA can meet “one-on-one” with the WANN teams to have more in-depth discussions on the APIs.  Primes can bring a maximum of 15 people to the “one-on-one” sessions and are encouraged to include their potential / planned subcontractors in their “one-on-one” meetings.  The goal of the WAND effort is to design and develop the network technologies necessary to establish ultra-large (tens of thousands of nodes), highly-scalable, highly-adaptive ad-hoc networks that provide robust networking across densely-connected deployments of inexpensive wireless nodes.  The premise of the WNaN vision is that WAND-enabled networks will adapt to changing conditions and mission requirements by adjusting the topology of the network and the operational mode of the wireless nodes, to create and maintain a rich, multiply-connected network fabric.  This rich interconnection fabric will provide superior battlefield communications at lower system cost and enhance survivability by ensuring information, applications, and services are readily available within the tactical environment.  Previous practice has been to build high cost and hence sparsely deployed nodes, and to organize the network around these nodes. This program aims to shift the approach used to design military wireless networks from design for radio range to design for node density.  WNaN has two complementary components: (1) Low-cost, multi-channel, spectrum-agile, MIMO-capable wireless nodes built with inexpensive RF circuit technology (WANN focus), and (2) Network with densely deployed low-cost wireless nodes and adaptive network layers that mitigates the shortcomings of the nodes by leveraging the rich interconnection topologies (WAND focus).  When integrated together and deployed, these two components create a distributed, intelligent network entity that is more than the sum of its parts.  The result will be a novel mobile wireless communication system that is both inexpensive and high-performance.  The WAND effort will include 3 sequential phases.  DARPA is soliciting proposals for all three phases of the WAND effort with BAA 07-07 – WNaN Adaptive Network Development (WAND).  A BAA 07-07 Proposers’ Day was held on 27 February 2007.   The overall program concept and specific objectives were presented at the Proposers’ Day meeting.  The BAA 07-07 Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) and the briefings and attendance list from the Proposers’ Day are available at: http://www.darpa.mil/sto/solicitations/WAND/index.html.  The meeting will be unclassified. TIM Registration Instructions: Participants are requested to register NLT 4 April 2007 at http://safe.sysplan.com/TIMN-API.

<SUBJECT>--Request For Information: Innovation Investment Process: Pharmacy Fraud, Waste & Abuse Initiative
<DESC>Intent: This Request For Information (RFI) is to understand industry leading practices around detection, recovery and prevention of pharmacy fraud, waste, and abuse.  In addition, it seeks to assess industry capability to develop and implement fraud, waste, and ab use programs for the Military Health Systems (MHS) pharmacy program.  All potential vendors must have expertise in pharmacy auditing and be able to deploy of a full set of proven tools to identify and recover savings. Expected outcomes of a pharmacy fraud, waste and abuse program for the Military Health System should include the ability to: "	Analyze pharmacy claims data to identify errors, fraud, and/or abuse in mail and retail channels "	Generate reports that assist MHS Pharmacy Leadership in monitoring and oversight efforts "	Enlist support of beneficiaries to identify potential fraud, waste or abuse situations "	Utilize statistical methods to select targeted pharmacies, providers, and claims for desk audits  "	Perform random and targeted field audits to assess compliance with MHS processes and procedures and to identify control weaknesses and opportunities for improvement  "	Conduct a detailed improper payments review to identify and collect overpayments "	Demonstrate a strong return on investment Background:   The Military Health System mission is to enhance the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Nations security by providing health support for the full range of military operations and sustaining the health of all those entrusted to its care.  One of the compo nents of the Military Health System is the operation of a health care plan for military personnel and their dependants  TRICARE.  The TRICARE program is managed by TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) under the authority of the Office of the Assistant Secret ary of Defense for Health Affairs (OSD/HA).  The DoD administers an integrated TRICARE Pharmacy Benefits Program which offers pharmacy services to eligible beneficiaries through direct care pharmacies located at Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs), the TRICARE Mail Order Pharmacy (TMOP) contract, or  the TRICARE Retail Pharmacy (TRRx) contract. The TRRx contract allows eligible beneficiaries to obtain pharmacy services through either TRICARE retail network pharmacies or otherwise authorized retail non-network pharmacies. TMA contracts with several large corporations to provide claims processing, customer service and other administrative functions to the TRICARE program.  More specific to pharmacy, one contractor serves as the national TRICARE Pharmacy Benefit Manager  Exp ress Scripts, Inc. (ESI).  ESI provides the TMOP (including specialty pharmacy) services, provides a TRICARE retail pharmacy network, and performs as a fiscal intermediary on behalf of DoD to pay for all authorized pharmaceuticals and supplies for eligible  beneficiaries.  In Fiscal Year 2006, TRICAREs retail pharmacy network filled 58.8 million prescriptions and TMOP filled 7.8 million prescriptions.

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional cost that otherwise would not occur.

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  ?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships.

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Humanitarian Assistance Advisor/Military (HAA/Military) position was established to more effectively coordinate the activities of the Operations Liaison Unit (OLU) of the Operations Division (OPS) of USAID's Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA).  These activities include military liaison and coordination, Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) deployment, Response Management Team (RMT) participation and Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, or Explosive (CBRNE) disaster planning under Presidential Decision Directive 39/62.  The HAA/Military will be located within the OPS's OLU and functions as the Division's principal point of contact with the Department of Defense (DoD).

INTRODUCTION

OFDA is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, DARTs, and Washington-based RMTs, to ensure OFDA's capacity to execute and coordinate USG humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies.  OPS performs these functions through three teams, namely, Operations Support Team, Overseas Administration Team and Field Support Team.

The Operations Support Team provides technical guidance and expertise in Disaster Logistics, Search and Rescue, Operations Center Management, Military Liaison, Consequence Management, overseas support to OFDA offices and personnel and other sectors necessary to ensure OFDA's capacity to execute and coordinate U.S. Government humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies.  OLU is part of this team and manages OPS liaison with the U.S. Military.  

OBJECTIVE

The Humanitarian Assistance Advisor/Military will provide the critical liaison function between USAID and the DoD military establishment in order to represent the humanitarian sector perspective and expertise in situations where coordination between the parties is required.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

- Assist OFDA management in defining a strategy for military coordination which will include guidelines for determining OFDA participation in DoD operations when specific requests are made and where OFDA should request activities and participation;
- Determine whether OFDA participation in DoD humanitarian activities is necessary and useful;
- Provide OFDA briefings and training to uniformed military officers at various DoD educational institutions (War Colleges, National Defense University, Navy Postgraduate School, etc.);
- Coordinate with DoD and the Department of State's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs to provide OFDA staff with briefings on military procedures, assets, roles, capabilities, culture, chain-of-command and humanitarian-related activities and circulate status reports which summarize DoD activities in which OFDA personnel are involved;
- Deploy with DoD forces in humanitarian emergencies;
- Provide reports, debriefs and evaluations to the OLU Team Leader and other appropriate OFDA staff of all planning, exercises and deployments;
- Assist in the identification of OFDA's DRM Division deployment needs in designated "at risk" countries where DARTs may deploy; work with other teams within OFDA to determine appropriate DART needs as a basis for contingency planning for personnel and resources;
- Deploy to the field as a DART member, as necessary;
- Assist the OLU in providing classified USG information support to OFDA as requested and to selected DARTs and RMTs on an as-needed basis;

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ)] for the following: NASA/GRC has a requirement for a number of small lithium-ion battery packs configured to power a portable life support system (PLSS) simulator in a demonstration scheduled for the fall of 2007.  The objective of this effort is to demonstrate improved battery performance using an experimental electrolyte, which has been developed by NASA for next-generation lithium-ion batteries.	NASA shall provide a sufficient quantity of the experimental electrolyte for substitution in the demonstration cells/batteries.  A small number of control cells, with the vendors “standard” electrolyte, will also be required for laboratory test comparisons.  A vendor having experience with Li-ion battery manufacturing methods is required to assemble the demonstration batteries. The PLSS will be operated in sessions at the NASA D-RATS field trials at Meteor Crater, Arizona in September 2007.  In previous trials, a commercial lithium-ion camera battery (IDX Endura E-50S) has been used to power this device.	A person in the field wears the D-RATS PLSS during this demonstration.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for NASA Glenn Research Center that is charged with developing the Thrust Vector Control (TVC) system for the Upper-Stage of the new ARES I launch vehicle.  As part of this program we will be building a hydraulics breadboard system to evaluate the TVC hydraulic system components.  A motor driven hydraulic pump is one of the TVC hydraulic system components that will be under evaluation during this breadboard testing. The overall goal of the breadboard testing is to evaluate the functionality of each hydraulic system component (both steady state and dynamic), determine if each hydraulic component is adequately sized, and to see how all the hydraulic components operate when integrated into a complete TVC system. GRC will also use TVC hydraulic breadboard testing to help characterize the motor/pump performance under varying operating conditions. GRC may also test out different types of motor/pumps including AC Induction, BLDC and BDC motor/pumps in order to help determine the most appropriate motor type for our application. The circulation motor/pump has two primary functions in the TVC hydraulic system.  1.	The primary function of the circulation motor/pump in the flight design will be to thermally condition the hydraulic fluid after cryogenics have been loaded on the vehicle (vehicle will be on the pad during this operation). Due to close proximity of various hydraulic system components to the cryogenic tanks, it is anticipated that the hydraulic oil will require some level of thermal conditioning (heating) prior to launch. This may require the motor/pump to operate in a cyclic on-off type of operational mode.  2.	In addition to the thermal conditioning function, the circulation motor/pump will also be used to hold the J2-X engine in the “null” position during the boost ascent portion (~ 135 seconds) of the vehicle flight profile. This will require the circulation motor/pump to provide a small steady amount of system leakage flow continuously at rated system pressure during this mode of operation. Motor/Pump requirements for TVC breadboard Test The general requirements applicable to the entire motor/pump assembly will be listed first followed by requirements that are specific to either the pump or the motor. General Motor/Pump Assembly Requirements: 1.	Motor/Pump Hardware Condition: Motor/pump assembly can either be a new motor/pump assembly or a re-furbished motor/pump assembly. 2.	Fluid Medium: The motor/pump shall be designed to operate with hydraulic fluid conforming to MIL-PRF-83282. If motor/pump is not designed for this fluid type then contractor shall note non-conformance. In addition, contractor shall inform NASA of the additional cost/schedule required for modifying motor/pump design to be compatible with MIL-PRF-83282 which will be subject to NASA concurrence/approval. 3.	Design:  Motor/pump shall be a fully integrated design (motor/pump is one complete package and requires no additional integration of the motor & pump by NASA GRC). 4.	Cooling Requirement: Motor/pump may be either liquid cooled (using system hydraulic working fluid) or air cooled. The method of motor/pump cooling shall be integrated into the overall motor/pump assembly. a.	If air cooled, motor/pump shall be capable of meeting or exceeding the performance requirements outlined in this document while operating in an air temperature range of 60 F to 80 F. b.	If liquid cooled, motor/pump shall be capable of meeting or exceeding the performance requirements outlined in this document while operating with hydraulic fluid that has a temperature range of -40 F to +250 F (system maximum temperature). In addition, the circulation motor/pump shall be capable of meeting or exceeding the performance requirements outlined in this document while operating with a maximum pump hydraulic fluid inlet temperature of 225 F. c.	NASA GRC would also like to have vendor give input on the type of cooling that will likely be required for eventual motor/pump flight design. NASA GRC can send vendor estimated duty cycle of motor/pump as well as other pertinent information environmental type of information if required. 5.	Interface Requirements: Contractor shall provide NASA with motor/pump interface requirements for hydraulics, electrical and for mounting of motor/pump. All interface information shall be sent to NASA GRC for concurrence/approval. a.	Electrical Connections: Industry standard electrical connections such as MIL-C-5015, MIL-DTL-38999 or equivalent are preferred. All electrical connection information shall be sent to NASA GRC for concurrence/approval. b.	Fluid Connections: SAE straight threads per MS33649 or equivalent are preferred. All fluid connection information shall be sent to NASA GRC for concurrence/approval c.	Mounting: Mounting provisions shall be supplied for motor/pump. If isolation mounts are recommended for operation then vendor shall either (1) supply vibration isolation mounts with motor/pump assembly or (2) provide required information to NASA GRC so that NASA GRC can procure vibration isolation mounts 6.	Fluid Temperature: The motor/pump shall be designed to operate within a hydraulic fluid temperature range of -40 F to +250 F in the hydraulic system. a.	The circulation motor/pump shall be capable of meeting or exceeding the performance requirements outlined in this document while operating with a maximum pump hydraulic fluid inlet temperature of 225 F. 7.	Duty Cycle/Modes of Operation: As mentioned in the synopsis, it is anticipated that the motor/pump will be required to operate in two different modes: (1) cyclic on/off mode to thermally condition the hydraulic fluid while the launch vehicle is on the pad and (2) continuous mode to hold the J-2X engine in “null” position during boost ascent (~ 135 seconds). Therefore, the BB motor/pump shall be capable of being cycled on/off. The number of times that the BB motor/pump will need to be cycled on/off is TBD.  The estimated minimum/maximum duration/duty cycle that the BB motor/pump will need to operate in this cyclic mode is as follows: a.	Minimum duration of cyclic mode of operation: ~ 2.5 hours @ 50 % duty cycle b.	Maximum duration of cyclic mode of operation: TBD 8.	Life: Contractor shall provide pertinent life information for motor/pump to NASA for review/approval. NASA GRC can supply preliminary motor/pump duty cycle information to vendor if required. a.

2. STATEMENT OF WORK

Oversee the development and implementation of a comprehensive fixed-wing flight standardization program for the Office of Aviation.  

Provide academic and flight instruction to personnel assigned to perform fixed-wing pilot duties at Patrick AFB, Florida or overseas locations.  Training includes the full range of theory, formal classroom instruction, and actual flight practice.  Apply the “Fundamentals of Instruction” as listed in the FAA Flight Instructor’s Handbook, during flight training.  Demonstrate the standard method of accomplishing flight tasks in accordance with the appropriate fixed-wing Aircrew Training Manual.     

Provide instruction to and or evaluate DoS Flight Instructors/Standardization Instructor Pilots, Contractor Standardization Instructor Pilots, and Host Nation Standardization Instructor Pilots in the DoS INL Office of Aviation Flight Standardization Program.  Training includes instruction in DoS flight operating rules, use of the Guide to Aviation Training and Standardization, and use of the Aircrew Training Manual and standardization program management.

Review and recommend establishment of formal courses of instruction, training aids, training programs, training standards, training directives and related material to support the Fixed-Wing Standardization Program.  Through the contractor fixed-wing standardization instructor pilot, establish training programs to ensure maximum utilization of training facilities, adherence to training standards, and avoid duplication of training efforts.             

Collect, review, and disseminate data on fixed-wing tactics, techniques, and employment in support of the counter-narcotics mission of the Office of Aviation.  Maintain constant liaison with U.S. Department of Defense, Department of State, Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS), other U.S. Government agencies, and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to keep abreast of current policies, procedures, and rules that pertain to the Office of Aviation fixed-wing standardization program.

Perform contract oversight of contractor fixed-wing flight training and standardization.  Ensure that contractor pilots, flight instructors, and standardization instructor pilots conform to the standards of the Office of Aviation Fixed-Wing Standardization Program.  Prepare periodic contractor performance reports for the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR).  

Perform flight duties as single or multi-engine land airplane Pilot-in-Command, Flight Instructor, Instrument Evaluator/Examiner, and Standardization Instructor Pilot.  Flight duties include day, night unaided, and Night Vision Goggles (NVG) in both visual meteorological conditions (VMC) and instrument meteorological conditions (IMC).  Actual tasks may include agricultural, aerial applicator type flying (below 50 feet), contour flying (50 to 100 feet above ground level {AGL}), low-level flying (between 100 and 500 feet above ground level {AGL}), and emergency procedures training tasks.     

3.  COMPLEXITY

The Contractor employee performs fixed-wing flight standardization oversight of U.S. Government, contractor and host nation airplane pilots operating in domestic and overseas locations, as well as at multiple forward operating locations.   

The Contractor employee develops multi-national/multi-cultural fixed wing pilot training programs, plans, policies, and procedures for the Office of Aviation, coordinates recommendations from standardization committees, consults with the Director of Operations regarding ongoing projects, provides guidance to contractor, host nation and DoS instructor pilots and standardization instructor pilots, and oversees implementation of the program.          

The Contractor employee performs continuous analysis of ongoing programs to determine the requirement for new procedures/policies that will improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and safety of aviation operations in support of the counter-narcotics mission.

4.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS

In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).
 
ATTACHMENT 2

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-12
HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

FAR Clause 52.204-9	Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

As prescribed in 4.1301, insert the following clause: 
Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Nov. 2006) 
(a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, as amended, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, as amended.
(b) The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. 
(End of clause)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) (September 2006)

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems.  USAID will begin issuing HSPS-12 "smart card" IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach.  Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new "smart card" IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems.  USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007.  (Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to October 27, 2007.  In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.)

Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC* or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo.  One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.)  USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer.  Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAID's information systems.  All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing.  The contractor or his/her Facility Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.

The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPS-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures.  This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/W and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office.

In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and the later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the most recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer.

The contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems.
