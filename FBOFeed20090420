<p>Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101 (10 AUG 2005) the following applies:</p>
<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMBC A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, email: Michael.jackson@scott.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.</p>
<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), Lower Colorado Region has a requirement for bright yellow, plastic toy novelty hats/helmets to be furnished for Hoover Dam.  They should be Adult-sized plastic, sturdy hats that resemble construction hard hats but do not provide safety protection.  They will contain2 stickers or imprints.  One sticker/imprint (to be placed on the front of the hat) will be Reclamation's seal (approximately 2  x 1").  The other sticker/imprint (to be placed on the back of the hat) will include the words "Hoover Dam" in black Arial font (approximately 2 ").  The sticker/imprints will be required to be placed on the novelty hats before the items are delivered.  All imprinting for logos may be required to follow the Reclamation Seal, Logotype, and Tagline Guidelines.  If required, specific information will be identified in the solicitation.  The offeror will be required to furnish a sample hat with its proposal.  The novelty hats will be shipped to Hoover Dam warehouse.  The Hoover Dam warehouse is located approximately 7 miles northwest of Boulder City, Nevada and 32 miles southeast of Las Vegas, Clark County, Nevada.  
The Hoover Dam Bypass Bridge project is expected to be completed in 2010.  It is anticipated that the bridge will divert all through traffic on U.S. Highway 93 across the Colorado River approximately  mile downstream of Hoover Dam.  The bridge project may impact the existing visitation patterns during and after construction.  Reclamation is conducting a study to design alternative tourism, security, parking, and traffic management options as a result of the bypass bridge.  The final design and plan is unknown at this time.  The number of novelty hats required by Hoover Dam is contingent upon the number of tour tickets sold.  The historical pattern of visitation at Hoover Dam could be impacted by the diversion of traffic.  
The Government anticipates awarding an Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity type contract for a five year period.  Fixed-price delivery orders will be issued as required.  The maximum quantity to be ordered under each delivery order will not be more than 35,000 and it is estimated that no more than 115,000 hats will be ordered per year.
This acquisition, when announced, will be conducted under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 453220, Gift, Novelty, and Souvenir Stores.  The small business size standard for NAICS code 453220 is $7.0 million.  This solicitation is set aside for small business concerns.    
The solicitation, in the form of a Request for Proposal, will be issued on or about May 20, 2009, with offers due fifteen (15) days after issuance.  All dates in this announcement are estimates and are subject to change.  The actual dates will be included in the solicitation.  No documents will be available until the solicitation is issued.

<DESC>U.S. Customs and Border Protection intends to issue a sole source purchase order award to Protection One for the installation and upgrade of the current security system.  The reason for the sole source award is because the Air and Marine Operations Center needs to have a reliable security system in place for the security at this location.  We require a vendor in the local geographical area, no more than 30 miles from the AMOC facility.  For this procurement there will need to be a service agreement which will outline and detail the response for repairing and servicing the system.  

Protection Ones expertise has been demonstrated in their assistance to the AMOC facility during periods when the current operating system crashed.  They have demonstrated their capability to respond on short notice to phone calls, request for product information, promptness in scheduled appointments, and knowledge in surveillance systems and are a nationally recognized brand.  Their Riverside, California branch office already has contracts and service on the March Air Reserve Base.  They are uniquely situated and qualified to satisfy the requirements on this contract.

<DESC>The USDA Forest Service, National Forests in Florida intends to award a sole source contract for short term, temporary management support services on an as-needed basis on the Osceola National Forest, Baker and Columbia Counties, FL.  Proposed contractor is Thomas Spencer, Lake City, FL.  This announcement is for information purposes only.  The needed services consist of providing inspection and oversite for ongoing timber projects, oversee progress of ongoing service projects in Stewardship Contracting, assisting in timber sale contracts, and related forestry support projects.  The required services are needed immediately due to recent retirement of employee with responsibility and oversight of the timber sale and silviculture programs on the Forest.  The proposed contractor is a retired Forest Service employee and has current expert knowledge and specialized skills to perform the required services, and is thoroughly familiar with Forest Service regulations, policies, procedures, facilities, systems, programs, and critical points of contact to maintain continuity of needed services.  Services are required on an as-needed basis for approximately 6-12 months until position is filled on a permanent basis.  The time and effort necessary to advertise and award a contract and train another individual to perform the needed services would be seriously detrimental on the ongoing mission of the Forest.  Amount of award is less than $25,000.

The workshop will enable participantsto be more aware of and skillful at managing discrepancies related to race, power,privilege, diversity, and inclusion as they carry out their functional supervisory andleadership duties across the Center.  It will also increase their capacity to recognizeand discuss dynamics of race, power, privilege, diversity, and inclusion within theirfunctional organizations and thus create opportunities for improving understanding,problem solving, decision-making, and teamwork.S.L. Robbins & Associates has successfully developed and previously delivered a Race,Power, and Privilege workshop module for other Goddard organizations.  The workshopsdesign and facilitation effectively enabled participants, regardless of race, to examineand discuss the systemic nature of racial privilege and its impact on themselves and atGoddard.  Several Goddard organizations, members of the Centers Management Council andindividuals attended the previous S.L. Robbins and Associates workshop.

S.L. Robbins & Associates has extensive, unique experience in working with theorganizational cultures at the GSFC.  They have proven skills and expertise in creatingthe necessary transformative experience in this culture for bringing the issue of racismfrom a cognitive, conceptual and analytical level to an effective, operational andsolution-oriented level.

Robbins & Associates is uniquely qualified to conduct atraining workshop similar to the one found to be so effective in the Goddard culturepreviously and to apply it to the specific needs of OHCM, EEO and the Special Assistantfor Diversity .  For this workshop to enable OHCM to remain a leading voice in theCenters conversations about race, power, privilege, diversity and inclusion and tofulfill its obligations to the Centers diversity strategy, S.L. Robbins is the onlyresponsible source.No other potential source that possesses the experience, skills, and knowledge necessaryto successfully meet the Office of Human Capital Management (OHCM) requirements for thisworkshop are known to exist.

<DESC>This procurement is an Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) opportunity at the Naval Submarine Base New London (NSBNL), Groton, Connecticut.  The proposed site is comprised of paved and unimproved area totaling approximately 4.3 acres.  The site available for lease is located at the southeast ("SE") corner of NSBNL at the intersection of Crystal Lake Road and Route 12.  NSBNL is on the east bank of the Thames River, partially located in both, the Town of Groton, Connecticut and the Town of Ledyard, Connecticut, approximately 55 miles from Providence, RI, 50 miles from New Haven, CT, and 55 miles from Hartford, CT.  The EUL site is located within the fence line of NSBNL, which is a closed base, not open to the general public.  Ingress and egress to the site could potentially be obtained from public roads Route 12 or Crystal Lake Road by repositioning the existing security fence.
Procurement Process:
The Navy is seeking a lessee to establish, operate and maintain a retail/recreational development that will enhance the quality of life for Navy personnel and the surrounding community and serve as the primary economic driver of the site in exchange for in-kind-consideration not less than the fair market value of the leasehold interest in the real property.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p>This is a combined Sources Sought Synopsis and Request for Information (RFI). THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. All responsible businesses, including small businesses, are encouraged to respond to this RFI. This synopsis is for planning purposes only and constitutes neither a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.
<p>The Air Armament Center, 689th Armament Systems Squadron, Eglin AFB, Florida, in coordination with Naval Air Systems Command PMA-205, is conducting market research to determine potential sources for a follow-on contract to the P5 Combat Training System/Tactical Combat Training System (P5 CTS/TCTS) acquisition. P5 CTS/TCTS provides realistic Air Combat Training to the warfighter and employs instrumentation on high activity participant aircraft and ground subsystem components. The system contains an air-to-air data link for sharing participant GPS based time-space-position information, and is capable of both rangeless and ground-based live monitor operations. This Sources Sought and Request for Information encompasses the continued production of the baseline P5 CTS/TCTS, modification of P5 CTS/TCTS, to include the integration of an advanced data link into the baseline, and sustainment of the total system.</p>
<p>The continued production of the current baseline P5 CTS/TCTS may be required beyond the current contract authority of June 2010. The government has no RDT&amp;E funds to develop a new baseline solution, nor does the government own unlimited data rights to the existing system. The government may also require modifications to the baseline P5 CTS/TCTS for reliability improvements.</p>
<p>The most significant projected modification, called P5 Advanced Data Link (P5 ADL), will require the integration of a Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) encryption radio and an advanced networking waveform. The JTRS radio planned for this upgrade is the Small Form Fit-K (SFF-K) variant. This radio and the Range Instrumentation Waveform (RIW) are currently in development through two separate government contracts, and will be produced as an integrated data link called the Advanced Data Link (ADL). Interested parties will be expected to establish the necessary contractual relationship with the radio and waveform contractors to ensure the total system, with the integrated ADL, will meet performance requirements. Availability of the ADL is not expected prior to April 2011; however, Initial Operational Capability (IOC) of the upgraded system by FY13 is critical to meeting the user's requirement. The government will provide the Weapon Simulations Interface Upgrade (WSIU) software for integration. Interested parties will be expected to assume the role of a lead system integrator and accept performance responsibility of the modified system. This effort also requires a seamless integration into the existing AF/Navy P5 CTS/TCTS infrastructure without loss of current capability and compatibility with legacy systems, and must interface with existing proprietary display systems which are fundamental to the mission.</p>
<p>For the above efforts, interested parties would be required to establish subcontracts, nondisclosure arrangements, and interfaces with other contractors and government agencies to: (1) perform tasks necessary to ensure the design of the P5 CTS/TCTS, its interfaces, and subcomponent integration meet the system performance requirements in accordance with the specifications; (2) enable free exchange of information, both proprietary and nonproprietary; and (3) resolve problems to prevent schedule delays.</p>
<p>The 689 ARSS is interested in meeting the following requirements for continued production of the baseline system, modification (to include P5 ADL upgrade), and sustainment of the total system for an estimated duration of ten years:</p>
<p>1) Continue to produce P5 CTS/TCTS beyond FY10 and retrofit or produce the ADL-modified system totaling approximately 2000 participant subsystems (PS; airborne, internal, rack-mounted, etc.) and approximately 300 ground subsystems (GS) and associated Remote Range Units (RRU), based on service life cost benefit analysis results. <br />2) Integrate the ADL into the currently fielded P5 CTS/TCTS baseline through the modification of the airborne and ground subsystems, as well as associated support equipment<br />3) Meet Initial Operational Capability in FY13<br />4) Integrate Weapon Simulations Interface Upgrade (government furnished software)<br />5) Implement Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS)<br />6) Satisfy existing P5 CTS/TCTS requirements <br />7) Conduct test and evaluation, to include a System Integration Lab capability<br />8) Provide performance based field and depot level support<br />9) Develop potential incremental upgrades to include internal and rack-mounted configurations, bulk-net waveform, Navy battle group integration, and/or Live, Virtual, Constructive training capabilities<br />10) Address the potential for unlimited data rights<br />11) Provide system warranty</p>
<p>Information available for potential government solicitation includes:</p>
<p>1) Waveform documentation<br />2) Radio documentation<br />3) Some non-proprietary P5 CTS/TCTS documentation and drawings, such as, P5 CTS/TCTS performance specification, tech orders, etc.<br />4) P5 CTS/TCTS executable code<br />5) Joint Display System (JDS) user information</p>
<p>Required proprietary information includes:</p>
<p>1) Individual Combat Aircrew Display System (ICADS)</p>
<p>Specifically, this announcement requests Statements of Capabilities outlining specific relevant experience and/or approach, as appropriate, in satisfying the above requirements, to include:</p>
<p>1) Demonstrated production of airborne subsystems (i.e. pods), integrated with ground subsystems and infrastructure<br />2) Capacity to produce 360 PS and associated GS, RRU, etc., within twelve months after receipt of order, for either baseline or modified systems<br />3) Identification of ADL integration risk areas in relation to technical readiness and maturity<br />4) Experience/Knowledge in:<br />a. Air Combat Training Systems and AF/Navy training ranges<br />b. MILS <br />c. Data link encryption<br />d. Real Time Operating Systems with Separation Kernel<br />e. Certification of Information Assurance products/systems<br />f. Cross Domain Solutions, to include Radiant Mercury, Trusted Guard, etc.<br />g.

<DESC>A. General Information:

In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), this request is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, a Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in the announcement. This is a Sources Sought regarding potential sources. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires Professional Services to provide consultation, advisory and project management services to Foodborne Pathogen Surveillance for Fresh Produce.
 

The intent of this SOURCES SOUGHT announcement is to conduct market research to identify sources to support informed decisions to procure for the required services, i.e., a total small business set-aside action  (e.g., SBA Certified 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran Owned, HUBZone, Small Disadvantaged, Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned,), GSA task order, etc. Our intention is to specifically identify small businesses. This notice is a Request for Information (SOURCES SOUGHT) for all interested qualified small businesses that meet the requirements for this effort.
The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541380 with a small business size standard of $12 million. This is not an invitation for bid, request for quote or other solicitation. 

B. Statement of Work Base Contract:

The contractor shall:

Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, furnish the necessary personnel, services, and otherwise do all things necessary for, or incident to, the performance of the work. 

The contractor shall provide staff (contract staff) to be trained and capable of performing the tasks as described in this contract providing quality of work.  

Ensuring the American public that their food supply is safe to the consumer is a paramount mission of the US Food and Drug Administration. The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, in conjunction with ORA, has the responsibility to provide the technology and methods for the analysis of foods. The emphasis of this contract is to focus on obtaining data that will reflect a broader scope of the frequency and levels of bacteriological human pathogens that have historically been associated with fresh produce commodities and a variety of ready-to-eat (RTE) foods.  Since the United States government has been advocating that the American public consume more fresh produce so Americans can lead longer and healthier lives, it is incumbent on all the players in this field, from the grower, processor, transporter, and grocer to the government agencies that provide an oversight on food production, to ensure that foods are safe to consume. This should apply to produce commodities grown and processed domestically and to imported foods as well, since the United States imports much of its food supply. All commodities that enter this country should also be devoid of any biological or chemical agent that can be deleterious to health.  Since the late 1990s, there have been an average of 16 foodborne outbreaks annually attributed to fresh produce. In many cases, the source of the outbreak is unknown; however, some, such as the recent Salmonella outbreak associated with jalapeno peppers, made national and international news. Although the Food and Drug Administration in 1998 (final guidance in 2007) issued its Guide to Minimize Microbial Food Safety Hazards for Fresh Fruits and Vegetables (Good Agricultural Practices and Good Manufacturing Practices), the Agency has had to respond to several major produce-related outbreaks over the past few years.  The potential risks, from either zoonotic or human sources, to contamination with either a viral, protozoan or bacterial human pathogen can be traced to specific commodities, locations (domestic and imports), water sources and perhaps equipment used in processing and collection. For instance, examples of contaminated commodities include leafy greens (EHEC, Salmonella), tomatoes (Salmonella), green onions (HAV, Shigella), cantaloupe (Salmonella), parsley, cilantro, culantro (Salmonella, Shigella). 

In order to better understand how pervasive microbial pathogens are in fresh produce commodities the objective of this contract is to analyze selected foods for the presence of Salmonella, Shigella, and Escherichia coli O157:H7.  As for RTE foods, our focus will be on Listeria monocytogenes. Our plans include the generation of a database for these select produce as to the frequency of isolation/detection of the aforementioned pathogens in each commodity as it relates to its geographical location and growing season. 

The impact of such data collection could have an affect on any Produce Safety Regulatory Options Developed by FDA with the following parameters: Consistent across the U.S., based on sound science, overarching (most commonly consumed fresh produce), accommodate specifics (commodity, region, operations, practices, size of establishment), and allow the U.S. to meet its obligations under WTO SPS.

All data collected as part of this contract will be evaluated for potential posting at www.FoodRisk.org is an online information resource providing data, tools, and resources for risk analysis professionals.  The site is hosted by the Joint Institute for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (JIFSAN) which is a partnership between FDA and the University of Maryland.  FoodRisk.org has agreed to host the formatted data and make it available through the website.  Having the data of this study from surveying environmental and food samples in regard to the presence of Listeria monocytogenes  in RTEs, purchased from supermarkets data accessible through JIFSAN will help FDA and others refine existing food safety risk assessment models, build improved models, and develop appropriate consumer education and outreach campaigns.  FDA supports the need to reformat the data and make it widely available through the internet.



B1. General

The contractor shall work closely with CFSAN throughout this requirement.

All services shall be provided in a timely manner to help ensure that CFSAN can fulfill its regulatory responsibilities and protect the American public from intentional or accidental contamination of the food supply with microbial pathogens. 

B2. Specifics

The various types of task could include, but not limited to, the following:

	1. Collect minimally processed (e.g. bagged) and raw produce commodities, as specified by CFSAN, from local supermarkets. These produce commodities should be collected from the months of July-September, 2009.

2. Analyze these agricultural foods for the presence of Salmonella, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Shigella using methods described by CFSAN.

      3. Any bacterial pathogens isolated, and not limited to those mentioned above or below, from any produce or other food commodity identified, analyzed shall be promptly and properly sent to CFSAN.

	4. Collect and analyze tomatoes gathered from roadside stands from states specified by CFSAN.  Analytical methods to detect and isolate Salmonella and Escherichia coli O157:H7 will be described by CFSAN.

	5. Any study within this contract will include the date of collection, date of analysis, microbiological methods used for analysis, and the results provided as discussed in section F-1.  All collection and analyses should be conducted in such a manner that the samples are to be considered as a blind study.

	6. The contractor should have the capability of designing a study to collect, analyze and report data from analysis of samples for Listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat meats, purchased from supermarkets. In addition, the contractor must be capable of proposing and executing a study to process environmental samples/swabs from the same supermarkets that the former food samples were collected. All food and environmental samples should be collected and analyzed as if a blind study. This will include: 

a) The ability to design nationally representative sampling protocols.
b) The capability to collect both food and environmental samples (e.g. swaps from walls, drains, slicing equipment).
c) The capability to analyze samples using both presence/absence and enumeration methods.


C. Project Background:

In performing the work as described in Section C-1, Scope of Work, the Contractor shall consider the following:

In part, CFSAN maintains an active research program for the purpose of developing and applying technologies to detect, to identify and evaluate microbial hazards that may contaminate products either naturally or intentionally. 

This contract is intended to provide CFSAN with a broad overview of the presence, frequency and levels of microbial pathogens in foods with emphasis on produce commodities. Outbreaks due to the contamination of produce have received a heightened interest from the American public. This contract should provide significant data on the prevalence of selected bacterial pathogens in a wide variety of produce commodities and a broad view of the presence of Salmonella in tomatoes.  The overarching objectives of this contract are to provide significant baseline data of potential microbiological hazards associated with the consumption of raw and minimally processed produce and to identify other microbial-related environmental and food-related risks.

<DESC>PURPOSE:

This is a sources sought notice to support NISTs market research efforts to identify qualified potential sources for an acquisition that NIST intends to solicit in Spring 2009 and award in Summer 2009.  This is not a solicitation, and proposals are not being requested at this time.  


BACKGROUND:

Under Title XIII, Section 1305 of the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007, the U. S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has primary responsibility to coordinate development of a framework that includes protocols and model standards for information management to achieve interoperability of smart grid devices and systems  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) will provide additional funding through the Department of Energy to implement Section 1305 of EISA.  NIST intends to use a portion of those ARRA funds to accelerate the development of the Smart Grid interoperability framework and model standards.  This forthcoming acquisition represents a portion of that effort.

So that NIST can ensure an appropriate acquisition strategy is employed for the forthcoming Smart Grid interoperability framework and standards acquisition, NIST seeks to identify sources that have current capability and experience to perform contract work for NIST in the following areas:
 
1.  Participation in Smart Grid standards-related activities;

2.  Facilitation of panels/workgroups that consist of representatives from relevant stakeholders;

3.  Revising and implementing standards roadmaps; and
 
4.  Developing and implementing testing and certification plans.

<SUBJECT>19--REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)/MARKET SURVEY Design and Construction Best Practices, Analysis and Recommendations for future submarine launched, diver lockout long duration combat submersibles.
<SOLNBR>N0002409N6213
<RESPDATE>022009

<DESC>This is not a solicitation, this is a request for information. This RFI is being conducted to determine if there is industry interest to produce combat submersible vehicles as described should the Government decide to procure such vehicles.  The decision to procure said vehicles has not yet been made, but this RFI would help inform programmatic questions inherent in that decision.  This RFI is for fact finding only and does not constitute a commitment or obligation by the Government to issue an RFP, contract or order.  The Government will not pay for any effort expended or any material provided in response to this announcement, nor would the Government return any data provided.
A future combat submersible should provide theater Special Operation Forces (SOF) commanders the operational capability to conduct insertion and extraction of SOF personnel and/or payloads into and from denied areas from strategic distances.  These submersibles would mate to a host submarine using the same interface as that of ASDS-1.  The submersibles should be able to conduct clandestine surveillance during extended loiter times at close-in distances.  A modular capability and capacity to hold varying payload would enhance its utility for a broad range of missions including intelligence collection, surveillance, and reconnaissance in support of SOF objectives.  An Initial Operating Capability (IOC) of FY 2016 is desired for the first of three potential submersible units.
BACKGROUND: The Advanced Seal Delivery System (ASDS), a first generation submarine launched, diver lockout, long duration combat submersible for SOF, was developed and completed final acceptance by the Government in CY 2003.  However, in CY 2006, the Department of Defense (DoD) cancelled the ASDS program due to operational reliability and cost issues.  A comprehensive and combined Government and Industry series of Critical System Reviews was undertaken, leading to development of design changes to improve reliability.  The fabrication, installation, and testing of these modifications are in progress.  In CY 2008, a DoD directed analysis of alternate material solutions to the ASDS program was conducted and concluded that a dry submersible launched from a host support submarine was the preferred alternative to fulfill the required mission.  Should the Navy go forward with a program, it would require an expeditious and low technological risk approach to filling this mission need! .  It is anticipated that if the Government decides to enter into a procurement that up to 3 systems may be initially procured.
APPROACH:  In order to minimize technical risk and expeditiously deliver the capability to the fleet in a cost effective manner, the designer would be expected to leverage appropriate portions of the ASDS-1 design in developing the detailed design.  The effort should take into account ASDS-1 lessons learned including operational history, investigations and results of the Critical Systems Reviews, and other available information on the ASDS program specifically to include Government Furnished Information.  One criterion for risk evaluation of potential designs would be the designer's approach to re-use of successful design elements and details from ASDS-1 as well as recommendation of appropriate and necessary changes to achieve specified reliability requirements including material availability, mean time between failure and mean time to repair.  The design is also expected to accommodate appropriate changes to facilitate cost-effective manufacture at the construction facility!  and would be expected to include changes for producibility (including potential weight reduction) and changes to account for obsolescence and/or diminished manufacturing sources.  It would be the responsibility of the designer to propose the balance of reuse and new development in the vehicle.  However, new design elements must be shown to have high technical readiness levels and minimum risk in integration with the remaining vehicle systems.  A total design effort of less than 2 years would be anticipated.
The Government expects the design drawings necessary to build the combat submersible vehicle can be completed in approximately 9 months and that a full Critical Design Review would be conducted by the Government prior to authorizing commencement of first unit construction.
The Government expects that the following potential items would be GFE:a)	Propulsorb)	Forward Looking Sonarc)	Hatches (unless bidder's proposal shows that CFE would be more economical)d)	External communications equipment and cryptographic equipment (excluding antenna system)
The Government is evaluating the following acquisition strategy, timeline, and schedule:
A full and open competition would result in award of a fixed priced multi-phased Preliminary Design-Detailed Design-Build Contract to multiple offerors.  These contracts would establish a firm fixed price preliminary design period followed by options to conduct detailed design and further individual options for the purchase of long lead time material and then actual construction for each vehicle.  Contract award would be based on consideration of the proposal for the entire design-build effort, not only the preliminary design period.  Contracts would be awarded to capable and experienced designers and builders whose proposals offer best value and demonstrates low risk solutions that can comply with the required technical requirements.  The design and construction specification would work to minimize program risk by encouraging reuse of reliable portions of the ASDS design including previous improvements and by making other appropriate reliability upgrades, producibility, aco! ustic, diminished manufacturing supply and obsolescence modifications.  The offerors would propose the balance between reuse of ASDS design including its current improvements and new design.  Exceptions to proposed new design elements are no changes will be allowed from the ASDS-1 Host Interface and the proposed hull design must not warrant the conduct of a new hull confirmation model or strain-gaging of the lead hull.  Additionally, the following GFE items would have essentially the same interface and performance capabilities as those currently installed in ASDS-1: SOF Communications Gear, the propulsor, and Forward Look Sonar.  The vehicle hatches shall be consistent with the 25 and 30 inch hatches used in ASDS-1 although updated design versions such as the Virginia Class bridge access trunk hatch may be proposed and the source is negotiable.   Following review of the preliminary design information, it is intended to award options to only one of the initial contractors th! at produced preliminary designs.  The detailed design, long lead time material and construction options on the contract would be established as fixed price options with incentives possible for cost and or schedule as appropriate to the individual option.
In the first contract year, award of multi-phased contracts would begin with a 3-Month preliminary design effort followed by approximately 2 months of evaluation at a not to exceed price.  The output of the preliminary design phase would also include preliminary design approaches to the contractor's perceived highest risk areas.  At the conclusion of the preliminary design phase, offerors would provide a Best and Final Offer (BAFO) including performance, technical features, cost, and schedule compared to the original bid and negotiated values and conditions.  Increased costs would not be accepted and a down-selection to a single designer and builder would be made based on the BAFO using the same source selection criteria used to award the contract but would also include analysis of products delivered as part of the preliminary design phase.  The option for the design effort starting in the second contract year would then be exercised using the BAFO pricing and the detailed d! esign effort would commence.  The contract priced options would also be adjusted based on the BAFO.  The option for the purchase of Long Lead Time Material (LLTM) in the third contract year may be exercised upon Government approval of the design drawings and details.  The fixed priced option for construction of System #1 may be exercised in the fourth contract year.  Similarly the fixed priced options for LLTM and Construction for System #2 may be exercised approximately one year later.  System delivery would be required NLT 36 months after contract.  Options might also exist for a third system.
A performance based specification for designing and building the system is being prepared to require adherence to appropriate specified design and construction standards where applicable, established quality control program, submission of design drawings and design data for government submission as well as the conduct of factory floor, and at sea testing culminating in a combined acceptance trials.  The specification for designing and building is under development and if the Government decides to enter into a procurement, it is expected to be released for review and comment as part of a draft RFP that may be issued as early as CY 2009.
GENERAL REQUIREMENTS: These unclassified system key performance parameter areas are applicable: A) Combat Range, B) Endurance, C) Passengers, D) Lock-In/Out Operations, E) Cruise Speed, F) Vehicle Signature, G) Interoperability/Net Ready Capability, H) Operational/Material Availability, I) Force Protection, and J) Survivability.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought notice only. The purpose of this notice is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classification (service disabled veteran owned small business, veteran owned small business, hub zone, 8(a), small disadvantage business, woman-owned, small business, or large business) relative to NACIS 325413 (size standard of 500 Employees). Responses to this notice will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions and are not considered adequate responses to a potential future solicitation announcement.The Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System is seeking sources that can provide an In-vitro Diagnostic System that utilizes current DNA testing technology to detect nucleic acid targets by hybridization.  The systems will provide testing for: 1) Factor V Leiden mutation and Factor II mutation - These mutations are both associated with increased tendency to form blood clots.2) Coumadin/Warfarin Metabolism - There are genetic variations that cause people to metabolize warfarin differently.

The Joint Communication Support Element (JCSE) requires upgrade to the existing Intrusion Detection System manufactured by Advantor. Advantor will change the SFX system to an SFXi upgraded system. The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to ADVANTOR SYSTEMS CORPORATION, 12612 CHALLENGER PKWY STE 300, ORLANDO, FL 32826-2700 under GSA contract: GS-07F-8785D.

<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT: The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within&nbsp;three days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<p>DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY): In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(A), this enhancement is considered a follow on contract for the continued development of a major system. Use of any vendor other than Advantor would require duplication of the ASN system, which would result in substantial duplication of cost that could not be recovered through competitive bidding. Therefore, expansion/upgrade of this system should be awarded on a sole-source basis, since Advantor has proprietary rights pertaining to the equipment and software used in the existing system.</p>

<DESC>SOLICITATION #: RFP-CMS-2009-0010

DATE: APRIL 20, 2009

SYNOPSIS:

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services intends to negotiate a sole source contract for the Physician Quality Reporting Initiative in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will satisfy agency requirements. The contract will be awarded to the Iowa Foundation for Medical Care as a follow-on effort lasting thirty months. The estimated value of this effort is $48,000,000. 

For the last ten years, IFMC has performed a variety of ADP tasks on behalf of the Medicare Program. At this time they are maintaining the Standard Data Processing Systems and Q-Net Websites. The majority of the applications developed by IFMC for the SDPS involve improving the quality of care for the Medicare beneficiaries.  They have a unique understanding of the requirements could also meet the urgent legislative deadlines imposed under three separate public laws.

On December 20, 2006, President Bush signed the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (TRCHA) Division B, Title 1, Section 101, Physician Payment and Quality Improvement which authorizes a financial incentive for eligible professionals to participate in a voluntary quality reporting program. A sole source contract was awarded to IFMC under urgent and compelling circumstances due to the compressed timeline for the system to be developed and operational for the scheduled reporting period.  

On December 29, 2007, the President signed Public Law 110-173, the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 (MMSEA), which authorized the continuation of the Physician Quality Reporting Initiative for 2008. 

On July 16, 2008, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act (MIPPA) was signed into effect authorizing provisions relating to the physician services be revised to adjust the formula for payment. It extended the Physician Quality Reporting Systems and provided for incentive payment for reporting measures for group practices on a statistical sample basis. It also required posting on the CMS website the names of successful PQRI reports and established a physician feedback program whereby claims and other data are used for confidential reports to physicians measuring resources utilized in furnishing care. It also included requirements for the GAO to study and report on the program, required the Secretary to report on a physician value-based purchasing transition plan for payment under the Medicare program for covered professional services, and removed all money from the Physician Assistance and Quality Initiative (PAQ) fund.

Section 132 of MIPPA provides incentive payments for 2009 through 2013 to successful electronic prescribers. Payment reductions will apply for  unsuccessful electronic prescribers. It also defined successful electronic prescribers based on reporting of PQRI electronic prescribing measures or through use of Part D data. The legislation also provided for a significant hardship exemption from the payment reductions for physicians on a case-by-case basis.

Any delays in the continued operations and development could compromise the integrity of the payment system in determining accurate payments. This may discourage providers from participating in the PQRI program and prevent CMS from receiving information critical to the quality of care being received by the Medicare beneficiaries and has the potential to create a substantial cost impact to the elderly due to lack of providers willing to accept the Medicare assignment or treat Medicare patients in general. 

This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. All interested sources must respond in writing with clear and convincing evidence to support their ability to perform this work within 15 days after posting. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on the response received is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested sources are defined as those companies owned by U.S. citizens and incorporated and located within the fifty (50) United States. 

The Contracting Officer for this action is Jaime Galvez. He may be contacted via email at jaime.galvez@cms.hhs.gov or by phone at (410) 786-5701. The Contract Specialist is Georgette Vlangas. She may be contacted via email at georgette.vlangas@cms.hhs.gov or 
by phone at (410-786-8372.

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 7 (Alaska) intends to award a sole source procurement to Alaska Gateway School District in Tok, AK. In accordance with FAR 6.303-1 and FAC 2005-30, this special notice announcement provides the Justification and Approval Documents for Noncompetitve Contracts.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 7, requires a monitoring site be established throughout the summer months in Mission Creek near Eagle.  Sampling will take place from approximately June 11 through August 7. Gee-type minnow traps (23 x 45 cm, 0.6 cm wire mesh, 2.5 cm diameter opening), baited with salmon roe, will be placed overnight in areas associated with Chinook salmon rearing habitat, i.e., log jams, root wads, small pools, and stream banks adjacent to riffles.  All captured fish will be identified to species.  Fishing effort will be recorded as fish per trap day (24-hour).  Aquatic habitat and weather conditions will be recorded daily.  These measurements will include water temperature, river stage, water clarity, weather condition, and rainfall amount.  The summer monitoring program will involve local students, teachers, and community members in the collection, analysis, and information dissemination of project results.The Mission Creek Fish Study is part of a larger project entitled: Use of non-natal streams by subyearling Chinook salmon in the upper U.S. portion of the Yukon River drainage. This larger project was funded through a reimbursable agreement after David Daum submitted a proposal in response to the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund 2008 Call for Proposals. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) accepted the Daum's proposal, which included utilizing the Alaska Gateway School District in 2008 and 2009. Daum must now complete his larger proposed project in accordance with the original proposal submitted to ADF&G. To change the proposal and subsequent vendors performing these smaller projects (Mission Creek), would jeopardize the entire project and prevent Daum from receiving any funds for this project or future projects. As part of the proposal's acceptance and funding, Daum must use local community partners to complete his project. Alaska Gateway School District offers the only community based student program in the Eagle, AK and Mission Creek area able to provide the services and fulfill the community partnership requirement. 
This notice is not a request for competitive proposals and the Government does not intended to accept proposals received.  See Numbered Note 22.

The U.S. Army Topographic Engineering Center, Geospatial Applications Branch has the first prototype of the Aqua Path Biosensing System for detection of E.coli at very high sensitivity and quick detection responses. The system controller is fully capable of synchronization with the prototype and no other controller is capable of electronic synchronization with the prototype currently owned by the TEC  Geospatial Applications Branch.<BR><BR>Items to be procured are the following: <BR><BR>0002 Ruggedized Table Computer - 1 each<BR>0003 Non recurring costs for SBC Gateway upgrade - 1 each<BR>0004 Upgraded SBC Gateway - 1 each<BR>0005 Telephone Programmer Support/Consultation Time (TEC to define # of hours desired) - 20 each<BR>0006 Programatic Gateway Endhancements - 1 each <BR>0007 Estimated Shipping - 1 lump sum<BR><BR>The following are essential characteristics of the Aqua Path Demostration System controller: <BR><BR>The AQUA PATH Demonstration System provides a wireless sensor network and controller to investigate waterborne pathogens.  This is a standalone system to be used in the field.  The AQUA PATH Controller System is a based on the Sporian AssetOverseer GW-UX, a ruggedized, single board computer (SBC) that provides a gateway between wireless sensor nodes that communicate via an IEEE 802.15.4 physical layer and IEEE 802.3 Ethernet.  Sporian's AssetOverseer uses a self-describing metadata framework that allows the addition of new sensor types without requiring software or other updates to nodes or gateway devices.  Each sensor contains a metadata structure describing the data formats it uses to send sensor readings and to accept changes to its operational parameters.  Gateways merge this data to create a combined data structure used for dynamically parsing messages sent to and from sensor nodes.  Sensors will include those already available in the Sporian AssetOverseer WSN and custom biological sensors being developed specifically for the AQUA PATH demonstration system.  The AQUA PATH Controller System requires hardware upgrades to support higher throughput and custom software and documentation so that US Army Topographic Engineering Center can access the gateway programatically through software that they plan to develop including (1) retrieving sensor data, (2) purging sensor data, and (3) setting sensor properties.<BR><BR>This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures.  There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement.  The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541712 with a Small Business Size Standard of $25M.

<a href="mailto:sylvia.thomas2@va.gov">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>Application for Brand Name JustificationBMC Software and Support


Each justification shall contain sufficient facts and rationale to justify the use of the specific authority cited. As required of FAR 6.302-1( c ), each justification shall include the following information:  1.	Requesting Agency:	Department of Veterans Affairs	Austin Information Technology Center (AITC)1615 Woodward StreetAustin, TX  78772-0001

Contracting Activity:	Department of Veterans AffairsCenter for Acquisition Innovation - Austin1615 Woodward StreetAustin, TX  78772-0001

2.	Nature and/or description of the action:  The Department of Veterans Affairs, Austin Information Technology Center (AITC), is in need of BMC software and maintenance.

3.	A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value):  The BMC software and maintenance is needed to meet the agency's needs for continuity of operations.

4.	An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.    FAR Part 6.302-1(c) "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." The use of the BMC brand is essential to the Government's requirement, and thereby precludes consideration of a product manufactured by another company.

5.	A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. Only the BMC brand will satisfy the Government's requirements and those contract holders on SEWP IV who offer this type of support service will satisfy the need.  BMC is available on SEWP, however, it will be acquired from Northrop Grumman I.T., Inc. via the AACES Prime Vendor Contract V200P-909.  AITC has an existing BMC licensing agreement through NGIT for all BMC products with terms and conditions the AITC needs for its disaster recovery/continuity of business program operations.  It is in the best interest of the Government to acquire the products through this vehicle to ensure consistent terms and conditions in licensing and maintenance, and to take advantage of administrative cost savings obtained from having all products licensed and maintained through a single vendor.  The strategies are in the best interest of the Federal government and the price is fair and reasonable.

6.	A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.  This procurement will be posted on FBO as a Special Notice along with this Brand Name Justification.

7.	A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.  It is in the best interest of the Government to acquire the products through this vehicle to ensure consistent terms and conditions in licensing and maintenance, and to take advantage of administrative cost savings obtained from having all products licensed and maintained through a single vendor.  The strategies are in the best interest of the Federal government and the price is fair and reasonable.

8.	A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.  Market research indicated that the requirement is available on the SEWP IV Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC).  The requirement could have been solicited under SEWP IV pursuant to the memorandum issued by Robert T. Howard, Assistant Secretary for Information and Technology, on June 1, 2007.  The memorandum instructs VA offices to use the SEWP IV contract for all IT acquisitions as of June 15, 2007.  However, the administrative cost savings obtained from having all products licensed and maintained through a single vendor far outweighed this requirement and was in the best interest of the Government.

9.	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as: (i)	Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available. (ii)	When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived. (iii)	When 6.302-2 is cited, data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and nature of the harm to the Government. Purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed because the brand name is necessary to meet the Government's needs as stated in numbers 4 and 5 of this document.

10.	A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.N/A

11.	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.Solicitations for future requirements will utilize "brand name or equal" language, if it is in the Government's best interest to do so.  The current requirement must be solicited using a brand name description because the Government needs to create an exact copy of a system that is currently in use.

12.	Certification requirement:  (Technical/requirements personnel must certify).I certify the supporting data, including the statement of the Government's minimum needs and other rationale for other than full and open competition is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge.
	Judy SineDivision Chief, Financial Claims Management Application Services	Date		This justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief.	Sylvia ThomasContract Specialist	Date

PART III - EVALUATION CRITERIA - Commercial Items
(a) The Government will award a time and material (labor hour) contract resulting from this request for quote to the responsible offeror whose offer will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:(i). Demonstrated Technical Capability - The Offeror's response should clearly demonstrate the technical capability to analyze, troubleshoot, configure, test and confirm the comprehensive operational status of a robust disk-to-disk-tape data backup and recovery solution using Data Domain disk storage, Sun Microsystems Tape Backup Units and CommVault software.  The quote should demonstrate the capability to provide on-site as well as off-site (remote) technical support to examine and quickly resolve problems.(ii). Past Performance - The quote will be evaluated on how the offeror demonstrates successful past performance for similar services.  This may be a combination of references, technical papers, letters of referral and a list of staffing qualifications and certifications.
Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.

The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees.<br />(b) Submission of quotations. Submit quotations to the office specified in this solicitation on or before the date specified in this solicitation. Quotations may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show --<br />(1) The solicitation number;<br />(2) The date specified in the solicitation for receipt of quotations;<br />(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the vendor;<br />(4) A technical description of the items being quoted in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation.

Vendors that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.<br />(c) Period for validity of quotations. The vendor agrees to establish a firm timeframe in which the proposed price is good for.<br />(d) Reserved<br />(e) Multiple quotations. Vendors are encouraged to submit multiple quotations presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each quotation submitted will be evaluated separately.<br />(f) Reserved<br />(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate quotations as described in FAR 13.106-2. Therefore, the vendor's initial quote should contain the vendor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government may accept other than the lowest quote; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotes received. The Government will evaluate quotations for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that a vendor is unacceptable if the option prices are signigicantly unbalanced. Evalutation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options.<br />(h) Reserved<br />(i) Reserved<br />(j) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number. (Applies to all quotations exceeding $3,000, and quotations of $3,000 or less if the solicitation requires the Contractor to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. The vendor shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its quotation, the annotation ``DUNS'' or ``DUNS +4'' followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the vendor's name and address. The DUNS +4 is the DUNS number plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned at the discretion of the vendor to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. If the vendor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. A vendor within the United States may contact Dun and Bradstreet by calling 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. A vendor located outside the United States must contact the local Dun and Bradstreet office for a DUNS number. The vendor should indicate that it is a vendor for a Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.<br />(k) Central Contractor Registration. Unless exempted by an addendum to this solicitation, by submission of a quotation, the vendor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation. If the vendor does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered vendor. Vendors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.<br />(l) Reserved<br />(End of Provision)<br />In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

5.  Installation Access Badges:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures for readily identifying contractor employees working on the installation.  The installation may either provide access badges to individual contractor employees at government expense or it may require the contractor to provide badges to its employees, at its expense.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.  
6.  Denial of Access:  The Commanding General of each installation has broad authority to remove or exclude any person in fulfilling his responsibility to protect personnel and property, to maintain good order and discipline, and to ensure the successful and uninterrupted performance of the Marine Corps mission.  In the exercise of this authority, the Commanding General may refuse to grant access or may bar contractor employees, including employees who have previously been granted access.  Refusal to grant an employee access or barment of an employee does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue performance under this contract.  Among other reasons, access may be denied if it is determined that an employee:	a.    is on the National Terrorist watch List.	b.    is illegally present in the United States.c.	is subject to an outstanding warrant.d.	has knowingly submitted an employment questionnaire with false or fraudulent  information.	e.    has been issued a debarment order and is currently banned from military installations.

Relevant contracts include those held within the past three (3) years with civilian and/or Government agencies for similar types of work.  Offeror's submitting no past performance information will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  However, the proposal of an offeror with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposal of other offeror's.  Past performance information shall demonstrates how well the Offeror satisfied its customers on previous contracts and shall  include name(s) for points of contact, telephone numbers, email address, contract number (if ! any), contract price, period of performance, years performed and any unique qualities of the contract.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation and Notice of Intent.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) for a software license renewal for the IBM Unidata software maintenance under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This will be in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5, as applicable, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Submit offers on HTC711-09-Q-0164.  The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-24, dated 28 February 2008.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 511210 and the small business size is $25M.  

IBM Corporation is the only known supplier of IBM Unidata software maintenance as required by the Surface Cargo Systems Branch of HQ Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC), Global Freight Systems (GFM).  The IBM Unidata software is a proprietary product of IBM Corporation.  There are no similar products available through other companies. This acquisition is for technical support for the IBM Unidata.  IBM Unidata has been a critical COTS component of GFM since its start in the late 80s.  At the core of GFM are the UniData database engine and about 400,000 lines of UniBasic Software Lines of Code (SLOC).  While GFM can operate in an extremely limited fashion without the presence of UniData and UniBasic, it would not be able to operate its core functionality.  Based on the market research, no company other than IBM Corporation can provide the necessary software products for the requirement.  SDDC provided Justification and Approval (J&A) stating that GFM can not function without IBM Unidata, and that not using Unidata would incur massive costs, risks, and prolonged mission failure.  A sole source purchase is recommended in order to fulfill this mission requirement. This action will not be open for competition as Unidata is a proprietary product of IBM Corporation.  FOB Point shall be Destination, Scott AFB, IL.  Delivery location is HQ SDDC, 709 Ward Drive, BLDG. 1990, Room 1E171-72, Scott AFB, IL 62225.

<DESC><p>The purpose of this modification is to: (1) Remove the paragraph found in Section V.2 Review and Selection Process in its entirety and replace with the following:</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: The Government may use the services of MITRE in an advisory role for the technical evaluation of proposals. The exclusive responsibility for evaluation and selection/non-selection remains with the Government. Representatives of the foregoing firm participating in the evaluation process will sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to highlight the sensitivity of the evaluation process and to protect any proprietary information within the proposals. Any objection to the use of any or all of the personnel identified above must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p><br />The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors.

These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>All other information remains the same.</p>

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled FY 2009 IPP Seed Fund CallAnnouncement which was posted on February 19, 2009. You are notified that the followingchanges below are made: The Innovative Partnerships Program (IPP) provides technology for NASAs MissionDirectorates, Programs and Projects through investments and technology partnerships withindustry, academia, government agencies and national laboratories. As one of NASA'sMission Support Offices, IPP supports all four Mission Directorates and has programoffices at each of the ten NASA Centers. The IPP Partnership Seed Fund over the last fewyears has demonstrated success by enhancing NASA's ability to meet mission technologygoals by providing seed funding to address barriers and initiate cost-shared,joint-development partnerships. The IPP Seed Fund is used to provide "seed" funding toenable larger partnerships and development efforts to occur and will encourage, to themaximum extent possible, the leveraging of funding, resources and expertise from non-NASApartners, NASA Programs and Projects and NASA Centers. This Call to NASA Centers is soliciting proposals for cost-shared partnerships withindustry, academia, research institutions, national laboratories and other governmentagencies for joint development of technology that is of mission interest to AeronauticsResearch Mission Directorate (ARMD) see the ARMD website: www.aeronautics.nasa.gov andNASAs Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD)  see the ESMD website:www.exploration.nasa.gov.  ARMD and ESMD have identified focused technology needsaddressed by this updated call. Therefore, this modified announcement includes only thosetechnology needs relevant to these two missions. This solicitation is being distributedthrough the NASA Center IPP Offices (IPPO). In order to solicit external interest forpartnerships through this Call, this Announcement is posted to www.Fedbizopps.gov and thehttp://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/ website. Responses to this Announcement must involvepartnerships with NASA and be received from NASA personnel participating as a PartnershipManager (PM) in the Center IPP Office; with proposals including both an internal NASACo-Principal Investigator (Co-PI) and an External Co-PI.  Proposals submitted directlyfrom parties external to NASA will not be accepted.Project proposals, due for submission from NASA Centers by May 20, 2009, must include oneor more non-NASA partners in addition to non-IPP NASA partners who are committed tocost-share at a desired level at least equal to, or greater than, the Seed Fund fundingprovided to the project. For prior Seed Fund projects in the aggregate, additionalinternal NASA resources have typically matched the Seed Fund contribution, with externalresources matching total NASA resources (Mission Directorate and NASA program/projectand/or Center) for a nearly 4:1 total leveraging for the project, relative to the IPPfunding.  Higher leveraging is desired and may enable more awards. Acceptablecost-sharing from the partner excludes any sunk costs and includes only actual dollarsapplied directly to the project, in-kind considerations such as workforce labor and theuse of unique and dedicated facilities and testbeds. Monetary valuation of partnerin-kind facility and/or testbed access should be based solely on actual costs incurred bythe partner in the performance of the proposed project, and should not reflect thepartner's already-incurred cost for developing the technology including the originalcapital expenditure for construction of the subject facilities and/or testbeds.
