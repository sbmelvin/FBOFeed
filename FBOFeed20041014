<DESC>NSN:  To be determined.
PN:   Multiple, see below list.
Nomenclatures:  Mixing Duct (PN:  1452M70G06), Spray Bar Damper Rings (PN: 2026M71P01), Segmented Flameholders (PN: 2026M64G04).

Item Description:  With funded airframe and avionics modifications, the F16C/D will continue to support Air Combat Command’s force structure through 2025.  The F110-GE-100 (F-16C/D Block 30/40) and F110-GE-129 (F-16C/D Block 50) engine weapon systems including augmenter/exhaust system are exceeding their original design life.  The augmenter/exhaust nozzle section is a leading contributor of labor intensive, unscheduled engine removals directly related to excessively repaired parts subject to thermal variances.  The augmenter/exhaust nozzle refurbishment, in conjunction with Service Life Extension Life (SLEP) and Aging Engine Upgrade (AEU) initiatives, is required to meet the funded, extended design life for the airframe.  This effort requires timely delivery of newly designed F100 hardware to support the refurbishment of the F110-GE-100 and –129 engine augmenters that will be refurbished on specific schedules at the  OC-ALC depot.

All responsible sources may submit a bid, quote, or proposal, which shall be considered.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services that the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a proposal.  This intent of notice is not a request for a competitive proposal.  However, the government will consider all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after the synopsis publication date.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Based upon market research, the government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies and services.  However, interested parties may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the government’s requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.    It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement contact the firm listed above.  Specifications, plans, or drawings relating to the procurement described are incomplete or not available and cannot be furnished by the government.  This acquisition involves technology that has military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).

An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this solicitation.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 736-3273.  Please do not call this number for solicitation requests.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION. This is a notice of a contract action. The Aging Aircraft Program Office  (ASC/AAA)is contemplating the issuance of Sole Source Contracts with Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation Integrated Systems/Air Combat Systems RG00/W6 One Hornet Way El Segundo, CA 90245-2804 Lockheed Martin Corporation				 5600 Sand Lake Road, MP 615				 Orlando, FL 32819					 Raytheon Company Raytheon Missile Systems TU/M09/3 1151 E. Hermans Road Tucson, AZ 85706 The Boeing Company					 P.O. Box 516						 Mailcode:  S270-3804					 St. Louis, MO 63166-0516	 Background: This current effort is part of an ongoing UAI effort. The Universal  Armament Interface (UAI) Program, Phase II objective is the development and  proofing of a Common Interface Control Document (CICD) by Original Equipment  Manufactures (OEMs) for implementation by the aircraft platform program offices  which will enable the decoupling of aircraft weapons integration from cyclical  aircraft operational flight program (OFP) updates.  The UAI CICD will  standardize applicable -1553 message sets and associated functional interfaces  and will include new common message definition and provisional growth  messages.  Aircraft programs will implement the established CICD in their OFP.   Weapon programs will conform with the CICD if a new weapon is being integrated;  however, legacy weapons having established interfaces will continue to use  messages/functions embedded in their existing ICDs, making the conversion to  the CICD when appropriate.  Requirements:   Contractor teams will define a protocol for achieving rapid, low cost  integration of weapons onto aircraft by decoupling the integration from the  aircraft Operational Flight Program (OFP) update cycles.   A phase approach is planned for developing and implementing UAI across the Air  Force's and potentially other Services' weapon and platform inventories.  The  current planned approach is as follows: Phase II: MIL-STD-1760 class of Air-to-Ground weapons [Current] Technical Objectives are further defined in the attached RFP. Each bidder needs  to respond and address all sections of the RFP in their proposal response. Acquisition Environment: The statutory authority, which  permits other than full and open competition for this  acquisition is 10 United States Code (USC) 2304 (c)(1), as  implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii) Only one responsible  source or limited number of responsible sources and no other supplies or  services will satisfy  agency requirements.  Proposal responses should be directed to the following: Ms. Marciana  Bain, (937) 255-3385 ext. 3110, or Mr. Lawrence Doelker, (937) 255-3385  ext. 3810; ASC/LPKC, Bldg 28, 2145 Monahan Way, Wright  Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7017.

<SUBJECT>58 -- SYNOPSIS on Enhanced Flight Termination System (EFTS) Encoders and Monitors
<SOLNBR>FA9300-04-R-0017
<RESPDATE>102704
<CONTACT>Joanne Eldredge, Contract Negotiator, Phone 661-277-7707, Fax 661-275-7852, Email joanne.eldredge@edwards.af.mil
<DESC>NOTICE OF SYNOPSIS:  The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), 412 Test Wing (412 TW/DRP), Edwards AFB, CA has a requirement for Command Transmitter System (CTS) encoders and monitors. The encoders and monitors will support the Enhanced Flight Termination System (EFTS) Project. The EFTS will provide a secure and robust method for terminating the errant flight of unmanned test vehicles operating on or from National Test & Evaluation (T&E) ranges. The EFTS will accomplish this by transmitting digital command messages instead of traditional analog tones to activate termination. The encoder unit will be integrated with the ground-to-air data link transmitting systems and operate in conjunction with the EFTS flight termination receiver unit specified under separate acquisition. The encoder unit will receive and format externally generated command messages from Command Controls (devices that generate the 64-bit EFTS message). The encoder unit will integrate and interface with the Triple Data Encryption Standard Unit (TDU) to encrypt command messages. The EFTS TDU is specified under separate acquisition. Information on the TDU can be found on the FedBizOpps website under RFP FA9300-04-R-0009. The monitor will be a passive radio frequency (RF) device and receive command messages transmitted by the Command Transmitter System (CTS) to verify command transmission.  The monitor will integrate and interface with the TDU to decrypt command messages.  This Notice of Synopsis is just partial information on the encoder and monitor requirement. The encoder and monitor Notice of Synopsis, in its entirety, has graphics that will not post under the FedBizOpps synopsis software program. Therefore, Industry is referred to the FedBizOpps upload, identified as Other, that is being posted under the encoder and monitor acquisition, simultaneously with this Notice of Synopsis. Figure 1 (under the Upload) shows the components that comprise a flight termination system. The shaded boxes indicate the units the EFTS project will develop. This synopsis is only concerned with the development of the encoder and monitor. The encoder is colored orange and the monitor is colored blue to show their relationship to the other components. Command control units will output command messages to the TDU, which is embedded in the encoder. Once the TDU has encrypted the 64-bit command messages, the encoder will add 19 bits for frame synchronization, 61 bits for Forward Error Correction and encode the resulting 144-bit message using bi-phase level symbol (e.g. Manchester) encoding. The bi-phase signal is then output at 7200 bps to an exciter unit. The encoder must support a number of indicators and controls: power on, power indicator, lamp test, key loading, valid key status indicator, key selection, key zerorization, fault identification, self test message, error detection and reporting and error reset.  The encoder shall fit into a standard Electronic Industries Association (EIA) 19-inch rack that is a maximum 1 rack unit (nominal 1.75 inches=1 rack unit) in height.  The monitor will be used as a situational awareness tool for range safety personnel. The primary purpose of the monitor is to “monitor” signals transmitted from the CTS. The monitor will receive signals between 370 and 450 MHz. Appropriate EFTS signals will be demodulated, decoded, and decrypted. The monitor will provide a number of interfaces: power, RF Input, Status and Control Interface, RF or IF Output, Post Detection Output, Post Detection Input, Post Correction Output and Post Decryption Output. The monitor will support the following indicators and controls at a minimum: power on, power indicator, lamp test, key loading, valid key status indicator, key selection, key zerorization, fault identification, self test message, error detection and reporting, Built-In-Test (BIT) and error reset.  The monitor shall fit into a standard Electronic Industries Association (EIA) 19-inch rack that is a maximum 3 rack units (nominal 1.75 inches = 1 rack unit) in height.  The Air Force Flight Test Center, Directorate of Contracting (AFFTC/PKD), anticipates release of a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the encoder and monitor requirement on or about 01 November 2004 with contract award in Q2 FY05.  The Government anticipates award of one five-year fixed price indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract. This is an unrestricted, full and open competition. The requirement will include 6 encoder test units, an estimated 120 operational encoder units, 4 monitor test units and an estimated 80 monitor units. Also included in the contract will be maintenance, repair, and data. Because of the nature of this acquisition, the successful offeror is required to have an existing, active COMSEC account.  The NAICS code is 334220 so the Small Business Size Standard is 750 employees. Sources are reminded that this synopsis does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Interested, qualified sources are encouraged to advise the Government of any limiting factors or issues that they think the Government should consider in this synopsis action.  Responses to this synopsis shall be provided no later than 27 Oct 2004 to Joanne Eldredge, AFFTC/PKDD, Edwards AFB, CA at e-mail: joanne.eldredge@edwards.af.mil, voice (661) 277-7707, or fax (661) 275-7852.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis. This synopsis is just a notice of a pending Government solicitation and requires no response from Industry.

<DESC>The government intends to negotiate and award an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with Time and Material (T&M) pricing provisions for engineering and analytical support services for the operational testing and evaluation (OT&E) of aircraft as required by the Commander, Naval Operational Test and Evaluation Force (COMOPTEVFOR).  This requirement will be solicited utilizing full and open competition.  The solicitation and resulting contract will be for one base year and three additional one-year option periods.  The main testing squadron supported by this acquisition will be Air Test and Evaluation Squadron NINE (VX-9).  The scope of this acquisition includes engineering and technical support for all phases of OT&E.  OT&E may be divided up into early involvement, OT&E planning, OT&E execution, OT&E reporting, and in-service monitoring phases.  The OT&E phases may be generally described as follows:  
* Early Involvement: This is the earliest OT&E phase of a program, and typically begins more than one year prior to the first scheduled OT&E event.  Tasks and deliverables during this phase focus on planning and resourcing future OT&E, and coordination with DT&E (Developmental Test and Evaluation).
* OT&E Planning:  This includes preparation for an OT&E phase of a program that will typically occur within one year.  Tasks and deliverables during this phase center on detailed test planning and scheduling.  DT&E coordination continues.
* OT&E Execution:  This includes executing the actual OT&E.  Tasks during this phase focus on scheduling, coordination, briefing, participation in, and debriefing test events.  Deliverables focus on data collection and anomaly reporting.
* OT&E Reporting.  This phase of OT&E centers on drafting the OT&E report after completion of the testing.  This phase is time limited.  Tasks include data collection and analysis.  The draft final report deliverable is the contractor's prime focus during this phase.
* In-Service Monitoring.  This optional phase occurs after OT&E is completed, reported, and the tested system is fielded.  COMOPTEVFOR and VX-9 may determine a need exists to situate an analyst on-site with a fleet unit employing a system VX-9 recently completed testing on.  Tasks focus on monitoring the performance of the fielded system.  Deliverables include anomaly reports and drafts standard USN/USMC deficiency reports.

Potential Offerors are hereby notified that the solicitation and subsequent amendments to the solicitation will only be available by downloading the documents at http://www.neco.navy.mil or at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

It is anticipated that RFP N00189-04-R-0005 will be issued on or about 3 NOV 04 with a response date 30 days afterwards.  Selection of the awardee will be made on a best-value basis; price and other factors will be considered

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division, Patuxent River, Maryland intends to issue a sole-source commercial FAR Part 12 contract with CACI, Inc. 1500 N. Beauregard Street, Suite 210, Alexandria, VA 22311-1715 for program management and technical services supporting the Chief of Naval Air Forces (CNAF), and NAVAIRSYSCOM Naval Aviation Readiness Integrated Improvement Program (NAVRIIP) in meeting the objectives of the Naval Aviation Enterprise (NAE), including Enterprise Cost Management (ECM). This contract will ensure the ability of CNAF to understand true cost drivers, measure output, and drive cost savings to the bottom line, as well as to retain readiness levels. This effort is a continuation of effort that has been performed by CACI and their subcontractor, The Thomas Group (TGI), for the past four years.  This effort will be utilizing proprietary process improvement methodology to support the CNAF Cost-Wise Readiness initiatives, which are critical to achieving cost reduction goals established by CNO. No other company has the technical knowledge, experience, expertise, and access to the proprietary processes and data required to meet the contract requirements within the required timeframe in order to ensure there is no break in service.  This effort will involve a base year effort with two, one-year options.  This requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii); the continued provision of highly specialized services deemed available only from the original source, when the award to any other source would likely result in a substantial duplication of cost and/or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Government’s requirements.

<CONTACT>Darrell Bachman, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-786-7442, Fax 410-786-9643, Email DBachman@cms.hhs.gov - Leisa Bodway, Contracting Officer, Phone 410-786-1278, Fax 410-786-9643, Email LBodway@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award a 5-year cost plus award fee contract, with a performance period of one base year and four one-year options, to a small business to assist CMS in the assignment of National Provider Identifiers/National Plan IDS (NPIs/NplanIDs) to health care providers and plans by utilization of the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES).   This is a total small business set-aside.  Potential offerors are hereby advised that their accounting system must be adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract and that FAR Clause 52.219-14 Limitations of Subcontracting will be incorporated into the solicitation and resultant contract.

BACKGROUND:  The administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 (P.L. 104-191) require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to adopt a national standard identifier for health care providers for use in the health care industry.  HHS adopted the National Provider Identifier (NPI) as the standard identifier in a Final Rule issued January 23, 2004. 

The NPI is a 10-position number, with a check-digit in the last position, and no intelligence about the provider in the number. The preamble of the Final Rule includes discussions on how providers will get NPIs, what system will generate the NPIs, what information is needed to assign NPIs, what information will be disseminated from the system and to whom.  It also discussed requirements that will be imposed on health plans, health care providers, and health care clearinghouses regarding the NPI, what impact the NPI will have on those entities, what uses will be made of the NPI, and the cost associated with building and maintaining the enumeration system, enumerating providers and keeping their data current.  

The effective date of the NPI Final Rule is May 23, 2005, which marks the beginning of the enumeration phase for the NPI.  Beginning on the effective date, health care providers may apply for NPIs.  The compliance date of the NPI is May 23, 2007, the date by which covered entities (except small health plans) must obtain and use the NPI in standard transactions.  Small health plans must comply beginning May 23, 2008.  Small health plans are health plans with annual revenues of $5 million or less.  The Final Rule states that NPIs will be issued by one organization known as “Enumerator”.  The National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES) is the computer system that will be used to uniquely identify health care providers, assign them NPIs, update their information, and disseminate data to the industry

The administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 (P.L. 104-191) also require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to adopt a standard unique national identifier for health plans for use in the health care industry.  CMS has not yet adopted the standard unique identifier for health plans.  Once CMS adopts that standard, and upon the effective date of that Final Rule, the NPPES will assign that identifier to health plans.  

DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS:  The contractor, generally, will carry out a number of functions, including, but not limited to, entering identifying information about a health care provider into the NPPES for those providers applying by paper application; provide NPI application forms to providers upon request; notifying such a provider of its NPI.  The contractor will process provider information updates received from providers via paper applications.  The contractor  will be responsible for assisting providers with questions or problems, including assisting those providers applying for NPIs by the Internet.  The contractor will handle all requests for deactivations and replacement NPIs for providers.  The contractor will handle potential error resolutions including investigating and resolving pending applications (applications with errors that prevent the NPPES from assigning an NPI).  The contractor will work with provider organizations that wish to submit files through Electronic File Interchange (EFI).  The contractor will validate the organization’s identity and establish accounts.  The contractor will be responsible for working with organizations to determine if their providers have NPIs.  The contractor will be responsible for resetting the web users passwords and user IDs.  The contractor will be responsible for maintaining a call center for providers.  This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP).  CMS anticipates release of the Request for Proposal in early November 2004 and it will be made available electronically at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire the installation of a used mass spectrometer and to perform sensitivity and response test to establish reasonable performance specifications as described below.

STATEMENT OF WORK
ASSEMBLE MASS SPECTROMETER SYSTEM COMPONENTS

Project location: 	U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, NERL, ERD
960 College Station Rd.
Athens, GA 30605-2700

Work to be performed:

The contractor shall provide all specialized technically skilled workers and all equipment necessary to assemble the components, parts and support equipment, including the positioning of the magnet assembly, of a used mass spectrometer system now location in Room 253 of ERD and make the system operational.  The contractor shall perform sensitivity and response tests to establish performance specifications as specified by the U.S. EPA.

Equipment to be assembled and made operational:

Micromass Autospec Mass Spectrometer (SN# S181)
Vax Station 4000-96
HP G1530 Gas Chromatograph
HP LaserJet 5SI
Miscellaneous pumps and accessories.

This system was operational prior to its removal, disassembly, and transport to this location.

Assemble the components of the mass spectrometer:

The various components of this used mass spectrometer system are located in Rooms 253 and 254 on the second floor of the Main Building of the Ecosystems Research Division at 960 College Station Rd., Athens, GA.

The electrical safety switch (disconnect) and the electrical transformers are located along the west wall of the instrument room 253.  Electrical cables will lie across the floor at the rear (west side) of the mass spectrometer for connection between the instrument and the support equipment.  EPA will connect the wiring from the safety switch (disconnect) down to the first transformer.  The contractor will need to connect from the first transformer to the second transformer, then to the instrument.  All other electrical connections on the instrument will be performed by the contractor.

The circulating water chiller is located along the west wall of the instrument room 253.  The water lines will lie across the floor at the rear (west side) of the mass spectrometer for connection between the instrument and the support equipment.  EPA will set up the water chiller and install a loop hose from the water outlet to the water inlet and the unit will be ‘on’ and cooling to 15oC and circulating water through the loop hose.  The contractor will need to remove the loop hose and connect inlet and outlet hoses between the circulating water cooler and the instrument.  

The rotary vacuum pumps are located in Room 254, which is immediately adjacent to the instrument room on the north and west side of the instrument location.  The connecting cables and hoses for these pumps will pass through ports cut in the separating wall and will lie across the floor to the rear (west side) of the mass spectrometer for connection between the instrument and the support equipment.

The minimum equipment needed to perform the assembly of this instrument and supporting equipment will be various common hand tools (screwdrivers, wrenches, pliers, etc.), power tools (drills, screwdrivers, etc.), a meter to check the voltage, current, and phase of the incoming electrical power before making final electrical connections to the instrumentation, and a lift capable of picking up the magnet from approximately 4” above the floor to approximately 60” above the floor, which will allow the magnet to be rolled into place once it has been raised to the correct height.

Floor plan of Rooms 253 and 254 is being provided as an Attachment to this Request for Quotation.  

Cleaning of the equipment

The equipment to be assembled and made to function under this contract is used and has dirt and oil deposits both within the cabinet and on some external surfaces.  The contractor shall clean up all dirt and oil deposits as much as practical from all surfaces.

Loose trash (paper) and other non-instrument items (screws, nuts, etc.) are inside the cabinets of this instrument.  The contractor will remove all items not necessary to the operation of this instrument.  Equipment was in full operating condition in the spring of 2003, and has been in storage since mid-summer, 2003.

EPA furnished items:

EPA will grant access to the building and to these two rooms to authorized contractor personnel for the purpose of working on this project.

EPA will provide the instrumentation of this system to be assembled.  

EPA will provide the support equipment, such as the water chiller, necessary to allow the instrumentation to perform properly once it is assembled.

EPA will provide electricity, air conditioning, and water at designated outlets only.

Items not furnished by EPA:

EPA will not furnish equipment, materials, nor tools of any kind beyond those identified under “EPA furnished items” and under “Equipment to be assembled and made operational”.  EPA will not furnish nor lease equipment for the contractor’s use on this project.

EPA will not have nor make workers available to assist the contractor with this project.

Performance Criteria:

The instrument will not be required to meet the original instrument specifications (as for a brand new instrument), but specifications that would be reasonable for a used, older instrument.  The performance specifications to be carried out would insure a minimum of 20,000 resolution (using perfluorokerosene) and a sensitivity of at least 2xE6 for a 2uL injection of an organic calibration mix (EPA#626) of 50 compounds containing 10 ng each of chlorophenols, chlorobenzenes, and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at 1000 resolution; GC conditions:  DB-5 column (J&W Scientific/Agilent), 30-m, 0.25-mm ID, 0.25-um film thickness.  The contractor shall print out a copy of the chromatogram and/or spectra to confirm the required sensitivity for approval by the U.S. EPA prior to completion of this work.  Specified GC conditions for meeting performance requirements are:  GC temperature program:  35oC, held for 4 min, followed by an increase at a rate of 9oC/min to 285oC, and held for 30 min.

These evaluations will be demonstrated to the Technical Coordinator, with confirmation provided to the Contracting Officer.  

Performance Period:

EPA and the contractor will mutually agree on the exact date of the assemblage.  However, the agreement should be within 30 days of receiving a quote from the Contractor.

Evaluation Criteria:

These qualifications are listed in order of importance, with 1 being the most important.

1.  Demonstrate experience of this type of work within the last three years. List names and telephone numbers of clients where this work was performed.  This applies to the contractor and to any other personnel to be used in this project.  A minimum of three clients should be listed.  

2.  List qualifications of the key personnel for this project.  Contractor must show evidence of experience specifically in the installation and/or maintenance of VG/Micromass Autospec mass spectrometers.  This applies to the contractor and to other personnel to be used on this project.  

All non-cost factors are significantly more important than cost or price. 

Vendor must supply Federal Tax Identification number, Dun and Bradstreet number, and Central Contractor Registration to be eligible for award.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541990.  Any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA’s requirement stated herein may submit a response, which if received by October 29, 2004, will be considered.  Responses to this posting must be in writing.  The estimated magnitude of this procurement is less than $25,000.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) in order to obtain Enterprise Data Centers (EDC) services.  CMS is seeking to procure world-class data center services through a Full and Open Competition, utilizing best value procedures resulting in multiple award, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts.   Through the EDC procurement, CMS will establish multiple data centers that are owned and operated by multiple industry partners.  To accomplish the aims of this procurement, CMS will need contractors who are experienced in designing, maintaining and operating large scale complex data centers.  These contractors should have an understanding of the Medicare claims processing environment, and should also have experience handling large volumes of transactions (a large volume is considered to be tens of millions of transactions per year).  Moreover, the contractors should be able to demonstrate their capability to combine best-of-breed traditional data center operations with the use of updated technologies and operations that leverage the latest Internet-based application hosting models.  Although an Offeror will not be required to provide a dedicated data center facility for CMS’ exclusive use, the Offeror must possess the capability to provide dedicated infrastructure within existing facilities in order to ensure the integrity and security of CMS’ enterprise operations.  CMS is seeking contractors who demonstrate the capability to achieve the CMS small business subcontracting goals.  Such contractors would be able to demonstrate meaningful subcontracting opportunities for 8(a), small, small disadvantaged, women-owned small concerns, veteran-owned, and HubZone businesses within the subcontracting plan.  CMS intends to issue a Request for Information (RFI) on or before the planned EDC Industry Day Meeting. The goal of the RFI is to obtain industry guidance to assist CMS in establishing enterprise-level integration of the EDCs’ operations without impairing industry’s ability to deliver world-class data center services.  In preparation for this acquisition, CMS is hosting an EDC Industry Day Meeting, to be held on November 8, 2004 at CMS Headquarters, 7500 Security Blvd., Baltimore, MD 21244-1850.  The EDC Industry Day Meeting will include briefings by CMS leadership and management on the need for CMS data center modernization initiatives and the critical importance of these initiatives to the CMS mission.  All official contractual notifications, including the RFI and  any subsequent amendments, will be made available electronically at this address: http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for any information/documents related to this acquisition.  Additional EDC Industry Day Meeting background materials and other relevant documentation regarding this procurement will be available on CMS’ main web site, (to be provided with the RFI).  This announcement is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a RFP or an obligation on the part of the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this announcement or otherwise pay for information requested.  The Government will not reimburse attendees for any costs associated with participation in this procurement.
	
CMS anticipates awarding multiple Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contracts, which will have a base period with multiple option periods.  Any questions should be directed to Ms. Debra Stidham, Contract Specialist, at 410-786-5129, or by sending email to dstidham@cms.hhs.gov.  Email communications should include company name and size (Large/Small), address, point of contact, phone and fax numbers.  Any additional information and documents on this requirement will be posted to http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

<DESC>U.S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION
Small Business Size Standards: Waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule
AGENCY:  U.S. Small Business Administration.
ACTION: Notice of intent to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Small Arms Ammunition Manufacturing.
SUMMARY:  The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is considering granting a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Small Arms Ammunition Manufacturing. The basis for waivers is that no small business manufacturers are supplying these classes of products to the Federal government.  The effect of a waiver would be to allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses or awarded through the SBA’s 8(a) Business Development Program.  
DATE: Comments and sources must be submitted on or before November 5, 2004.
FOR FURTHER INFORMATI0N CONTACT: Edith Butler, Program Analyst, by telephone at (202) 619-0422; by FAX at (202) 481-1788; or by email at edith.butler@sba.gov.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Section 8(a)(17) of the Small Business Act, (Act)15 U.S.C. 637(a)(17), requires that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses or SBA’s 8(a) Business Development Program provide the product of a small business manufacturer or processor, if the recipient is other than the actual manufacturer or processor of the product.  
This requirement is commonly referred to as the Nonmanufacturer Rule.  The SBA regulations imposing this requirement are found at 13 CFR 121.406 (b).  Section 8(a)(17)(b)(iv) of the Act authorizes SBA to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for any "class of products" for which there are no small business manufacturers or processors available to participate in the Federal market.  
     As implemented in SBA’s regulations at 13 CFR 121.1204, in order to be considered available to participate in the Federal market for a class of products, a small business manufacturer must have submitted a proposal for a contract solicitation or received a contract from the Federal government within the last 24 months. The SBA defines "class of products" based on six digit coding systems.  The first coding system is the Office of Management and Budget North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  The second is the Product and Service Code established by the Federal Procurement Data System. 
     The SBA received a request on September 7, 2004 to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Small Arms Ammunition Manufacturing.  In response, SBA is currently processing a request to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Small Arms Ammunition Manufacturing, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 332992.  The public is invited to comment or provide source information to SBA on the proposed waiver of the nonmanufacturer rule for this NAICS code. 
AUTHORITY:  15 U.S.C. 637(a)(17).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The notice posted on 10/13/2004 is hereby replaced in its entirety with the language below.  Additionally, the attachments (Proposer Information Pamphlet) previously posted are replaced with the revised attachments posted herewith.

Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of Navigation-Grade Integrated Micro Gyroscopes (NGIMG). The proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state-of-practice.

DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the area of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) implementations of NGIMG, with the ultimate objective being the realization of tiny, low-power, rotation rate sensors capable of achieving performance commensurate with requirements for GPS-denied navigation of small platforms, including individual soldiers, unmanned (micro) air vehicles, unmanned underwater vehicles, and even tiny (e.g., insect-sized) robots. By harnessing the advantages of micro-scale miniaturization, the NGIMG program is expected to yield tiny (if not chip-scale) gyroscopes with navigation-grade performance characteristics, such as (but not limited to):

(1)	Angle random walk (ARW) better than 0.001 degree/square root(hours).
(2)	Bias drift better than 0.01 degree/hr.
(3)	Scale factor stability better than 40 ppm.
(4)	Full scale range greater than 500 degrees/s.
(5)	Bandwidth from 1-300 Hz.
(6)	Temperature range from -55 degrees C to 85 degrees C.
(7)	Overall size less than 1 cubic cm, not including the power source, but including control electronics and any required device packaging.
(8)	Power consumption less than 5 mW.

Note that the above are merely meant to provide rough order of magnitude expectations of what is ultimately deemed possible by the end of the NGIMG program, and are not to be construed as rigid program specifications.

Although methods for rate sensing based on vibrating micromechanical mass-spring systems have successfully achieved tactical-grade performance, with bias stabilities nearing 1 degree/hr, they have done so with considerable difficulty. Pursuant to navigation-grade performance, arguments can be made to justify the use of similar approaches, but if such approaches are evolutionary in nature, they might be of only limited interest here. Rather, NGIMG approaches based on novel or alternative strategies or phenomena, not yet miniaturized using MEMS technologies, are of most interest, especially those capable of greatly enhancing the bias stability—perhaps the most difficult of the navigation-grade needs—of the proposed gyroscope. As such, research topics and activities relevant to the implementation of NGIMG might include, but are not limited to: (1) buoyant or levitated microstructures, or other approaches to isolating the sensor from unwanted inputs so as to minimize bias drift; (2) atomistic mechanisms for inertial sensing; (3) micro-optical techniques; (4) micro-fluidic approaches (both liquid and gas); (5) resonant or acoustic microstructures that sense inertial inputs through previously unexplored mechanisms; and (6) technologies that integrate the inertial sensing mechanisms together with transistor electronics.

Among the more compelling drivers behind the NGIMG program is the need for portable navigation sensors for future small or miniature platforms. As such, low power consumption is as important as small size, if not more so, in any chosen implementation. Part of the impetus behind the technical approach of the NGIMG program stems from the recognition that micro-scale miniaturization in all physical domains generally provides advantages (beyond size reduction) in speed, power consumption, and other variables, that make certain approaches more attractive on the micro-scale that would otherwise not be options on the macro-scale. For example, the enhanced degree of thermal isolation achievable via MEMS implementation is expected to offer thermal resistances and capacitances that enable substantial reductions in the power consumption for approaches that require heating or cooling. In addition, levitation is expected to require much less power on the micro-scale than on the macro, perhaps making it practical only on the micro-scale. Although miniaturization can lead to performance loss—a fact well known to those experienced with traditional approaches to micro-scale inertial sensing—the performance advantages it offers can often counteract losses to the point of achieving a net gain in overall performance. Clearly, approaches that benefit most (or lose least) from scaling are of most interest, here.

NGIMG-enabled devices with characteristics similar to that listed above and achieved via low cost, batch fabrication methods are expected to enable a myriad of strategic capabilities. In particular, the sheer portability of the rotation rate sensors sought by the NGIMG program should introduce a host of new applications and deployment scenarios, including wearable inertial measurement units (IMU’s) for dismounted warriors capable of GPS-denied navigation for lengthy periods; small IMU’s for unmanned air and underwater vehicles, and for guidance of small, long-range munitions; and tiny IMU’s for insect-like robots intended for a variety of future applications, including first warning perimeter sensing. Together with chip-scale atomic clocks (CSAC’s) and location-tracking algorithms that harness additional kinetic information (e.g., biokinetic), chip-scale NGIMG’s should allow man-portable dead-reckoning devices with unprecedented precision, with and without GPS. By enabling a swelling of applications, as illustrated above, miniaturization via NGIMG technology is expected to generate a need for high volume manufacturing that, together with wafer-level batch fabrication methods enabled by MEMS technology, should substantially lower the cost of miniature navigation systems, and thus, further fuel expansion of the application suite for NGIMG technology.

DARPA strongly encourages well-coordinated, interdisciplinary research and development activities that take into consideration all significant and relevant engineering tradeoffs and optimizations. Teaming among academic, industrial and/or government partners is encouraged, and it is anticipated that the contributions of the team members are complementary as well as essential to the critical path of the research plan. A technology insertion plan is encouraged and research that holds promise of insertion into Department of Defense (DoD) relevance is of great interest.

PROGRAM SCOPE

The Navigation-Grade Integrated Micro Gyroscope program will consist of a Phase I effort (12 months) followed by optional Phase II (12 months), Phase III (12 months), and Phase IV (18 months) periods, for those efforts that appear to have the greatest potential for production, insertion, transition or overall benefit to DoD. Awards are expected to be made during the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2005.  Organizations wishing to participate in Phase II, Phase III, and/or Phase IV, should include them as options in their proposal (separate options for each phase).   Multiple awards are anticipated.  The formation of multi-disciplinary teams consisting of industry, academia, and/or national laboratories with complementary areas of expertise is strongly encouraged, especially given the sub-system flavor of the MGA program. A web site—http://teaming.sysplan.com/BAA-05-02/ has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion, but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  Questions concerning this BAA may be directed to the technical POC for this effort, Dr. Clark T.-C. Nguyen, phone: (571) 218-4586, fax: (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: cnguyen@darpa.mil

<DESC>UPDATE (10-14-2004) AC vs. DC Seat Actuator on T-38 ESUP The purpose of this announcement is to provide information regarding a question  about seat actuators from the recent Industry Day.  Because this information  could have a significant impact on potential solutions, it is being released  prior to the posting of the other questions and answers.   Changing from Alternating Current to Direct Current Seat Actuators for the T- 38C ESUP  This question was forwarded to OO-ALC/LCEA for their review and comment.  They  recommend we do not use DC actuators if at all possible.  The DC load is taxed  with the AUP upgrade and other changes are pending to add further loads to the  DC buss.  The change to DC would also require an aircraft rewire to add a  circuit breaker and cabling.  It would be less of an impact to use AC actuators  and a much simpler modification to the aircraft.  The present AC system has 5  amp circuit breakers.  If at one half the capacity of the 5 amp breaker (2.5  amps,) 2.5 X 115 volts=287.5 VA.  With DC of 28 volts equals 10 amps current  draw.  Conservatively, this is approximately one fifth the battery capacity.   Operation of both seats at the same time would further impact the battery  drain.  The battery is rated for 15 minutes of aircraft operation in an  emergency situation.  Taxing of the battery capability in anyway is not  desirable. If you have any questions, please contact the contractual POC below. Contractual POC: Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //END OF UPDATE// UPDATE (10-05-04) REQUEST FOR INFORMATION REGARDING PRODUCTION/DELIVERY All offerors planning to respond to the upcoming T-38C ESUP RFP are asked to  reply to the following questions: 1) Assuming the Government exercises a production option concurrent with  contract award, how long will it take before production will begin, regardless  of testing?  2) Given the same assumption, when will your company be able to begin  delivering production seats/shipsets for installation and what will be the  initial delivery rate, i.e., shipsets per month or seats per month?   3) In addition and given the same assumption as above, how long will it take  before your company can deliver seats at a rate of five (5) shipsets or ten  (10) seats per month?  Please respond to these questions at your earliest convenience but NLT 3:00 pm  EST on 8 Oct 2004.  If you have any questions or concerns please contact the  contractual POC listed below.

<DESC>The mission of the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health,  is to help ensure an end to the HIV/AID epidemic by increasing basic knowledge of the pathogenesis and transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, supporting the development of therapies for HIV infection and its complications, and supporting the development of vaccines and other prevention strategies.  The Division of AIDS intends to recompete a requirement currently being performed by Rush-Presbyterian St. Luke’s Medical Center under Contract No. N01-A1-85354, scheduled to expire on September 20, 2005. This solicitation is being issued under full and open competitive procedures.  The primary focus of this solicitation is to continue an ongoing quality assessment program for virologic assays performed on samples from subjects enrolled in DIAIDS-sponsored multi-site clinical studies. The Virology Quality Assurance (VQA) Program is critical to the scientific integrity of on-going and future studies concerning HIV diagnosis, disease progression, and assessment of treatments, vaccine efficacy and other preventive measures.   Currently, the VQA program serves approximately 55 domestic and 25 international Sites.  The base contract is expected to cover these 80 Sites.  Although the structure of the clinical trial networks is subject to change during the Contract period, the changes are not expected to result in changes to the number of participating Sites in the base Contract.  However, the Government anticipates a need to expand the number of Sites during the course of the Contract, and such an increase in the Contractor’s activities may be activated, at the discretion of the Government, as one or more Options in each of the Contract years.  The VQA Program will serve current and future DAIDS-sponsored clinical trial networks and collaborating study groups (User Groups).  Currently supported User Groups include: the Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group (AACTG), the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG), the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN), the Women and Infants Transmission Study (WITS), the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), the Community Program for Clinical Research on AIDS (CPCRA), the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN), the Comprehensive International Program of Research on AIDS (CIPRA), the Acute Infection and Early Disease Research Program (AIEDRP), as well as other domestic and international individual grantees.  Collaborations are anticipated with CDC Global AIDS Program (GAP)-affiliated laboratories supporting the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) activities.  Most, but not all, Sites are currently linked through an electronic network which is used to transmit virology data from the Sites to a remote Central Database.  Sites are also using a customized laboratory data management system (LDMS) that tracks specimens, provides assay templates, calculates derived quantities, produces reports, and generates data files for export from the Site.  The successful offeror will be required to provide some VQA-related information through the DAIDS-ES.  While some of this may be accomplished through a link from DAIDS-ES to the VQA web site, some data may need to be shared by the VQA, with DAIDS ES, in which case data sharing agreements, standards, etc. will be required.  Specifically the contractor shall be required to perform the following: 1) implement standards of performance for existing and newly developed virologic assays and assess the ability of Sites to successfully perform the assays; 2) conduct studies on the adaptation, standardization and application of new and existing virologic and biostatistic methodologies; 3) acquire, characterize, store, document and disburse quality control materials and reagents to include biohazardous materials and infectious agents; 4) disseminate VQA technical and scientific data; 5) maintain computerized software systems that support the VQA Program; 6) expand services to include additional Sites when necessary through exercise of Options; and 7) implement a transition plan at the end of the contract.  It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a 7-year period of performance beginning on or about August 15, 2005 to August 14, 2012. This RFP will be available electronically on/about October 29, 2004, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Program (CMP) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract on FedBizOpps.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government.  This notice does not commit the Government to award or a contract.  See Numbered Note 26.  No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   THIS IS AMENDMENT 1 TO THE U.S.E.P.A. REQUEST FOR QUOTE RFQ-RT-04-00522. THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS TO PROVIDE CLARIFICATION OF TABLE 1 AND TO EXTEND THE DUE DATE FOR QUOTES. TABLE 1 Each of these compounds has multiple chiral centers (n), and when this occurs,  the number of enantiomers is equal to 2^n. So a compound with 3 chiral centers has 2^3 = 8 enantiomers. Figure 1 shows the chiral centers for each molecule marked with an asterisk. So in the table, the Government is requesting one vial with each pure enantiomer equalling the number shown in the  enantiomer column. Additionally, the Government is requesting one vial with each pure isomer equalling the number shown in the isomer column. For example, fenvalerate has 2 chiral centers, so the Government would like 4 vials with enantiomers, and 2 vials with isomers. THE DATE FOR SUBMISSION OF  QUOTES IS REVISED.  THE NEW DUE DATE IS OCTOBER 22, 2004, 3:00 P.M. EDT. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the  only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written Request for Quote will not be issued.  The RFQ number is RFQ-RT-04-00522.  This RFQ document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-24.   This acquisition will be processed  under Simplified Acquisition Procedures and is not a  Small Business Set-Aside.  The  North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is  541990 and the small business size is $6 million.  This acquisition will result in a fixed price purchase order. STATEMENT OF  WORK The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is seeking the services of a contractor to develop a method for the enantiomers and isomers of several pyrethroid  pesticide compounds for the Methods Development and Application Branch of the National Exposure Research Laboratory in  Research Triangle Park, NC.

<DESC>The U.S. Census Bureau (USCB) is contemplating extending the current contract with IBM Global Services, Inc. for application engineering and technical support services for the USCB Data Access and Dissemination System (DADS) for 27 months beyond the contract period. The current contract expires on June 30, 2005.   This action represents a continuation of service beyond the limit of the existing DADS contract options.  The DADS program has been developed and maintained by IBM for the past seven years. This extension is deemed necessary for the USCB to develop a long term solution for its data collection activities.  It is the USCB's belief that IBM is the only capable source to provide DADS services within the required time frame at an acceptable level of risk and
cost to continue data dissemination operations until the USCB determines its long term solution. However, interested companies who believe they can meet this requirement  should view the Statement of Work for the current contract at http://www.census.gov/procur/www/ids/ids.html, and show clear
and convincing evidence that they have the capability to provide the above described services. Interested companies should submit technical capabilities, business size, pricing, and other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the USCB requirement.  Please forward this information to eric.wayne.franklin@census.gov or fax to 301-457-8465
by November 5, 2004.  While this is not a request for competitive
proposals, responses received in response to this notice will be reviewed and evaluated for technical merit.  No telephone requests will be accepted. No contract will be awarded on the basis of the statements received in response to this notice.  If no responses are received, the current contract with IBM may be extended for 27 months (for two one-year options) without further notice.

<DESC>Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) is looking for companies interested in supplying a cryostat for the National Compact Stellarator Experiment (NCSX) (http://www.pppl.gov/projects/pages/ncsx.html). PPPL is operated by Princeton University under contract with the United States Department of Energy (DOE), and is the only US facility solely dedicated to magnetic confinement fusion energy research.

NCSX is a DOE-funded research project currently authorized for construction at PPPL in Plainsboro, New Jersey. It is a collaborative effort between PPPL and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).  

NCSX  is designed to operate at liquid nitrogen temperatures and, consequently, requires a cryostat (thermal and moisture barrier) to isolate it from the surrounding environment.  The NCSX cryostat will consist of an array of fiberglass frames called “insulation supports”.  The supports, after fabrication but before assembly, will be filled with urethane foam insulation as part of the complete cryostat system.  PPPL has posted a zip file of representative drawings in Adobe pdf format in the cryostat folder at the NCSX Manufacturing FTP site located at http://ncsx.pppl.gov/NCSX_MFG/welcome_to_the_ncsx_cryostat_man.htm. These drawings are representative of the eventual construction. The FTP site also contains a short slide presentation including computer-generated views of the NCSX cryostat assembly.  

PPPL wishes to obtain expressions of interest, fabrication recommendations and budgetary cost estimates for the insulation supports from qualified suppliers. Interested parties are requested to examine the drawings and provide responses by email to rtemplon@pppl.gov, or fax them to the attention of Rodney D. Templon at 609-242-2021.  Include the words “NCSX Cryostat Budgetary Estimate Response” in the document title.  To be useful to PPPL in planning this work, responses should be received not later than Wednesday, November 10, 2004. Firms responding to this announcement will receive notification of availability when the NCSX Cryostat RFP is released.  The current estimated RFP release date is February 11, 2005.  This announcement is not an RFP. Neither Princeton University nor the U.S. Department of Energy will reimburse respondents for any costs incurred in preparation of response to this sources sought announcement.

<CONTACT>Hamilton Brown, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 827-7043, Fax (301) 827-7101, Email hbrown@oc.fda.gov - Megan Gnall, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 827-7167, Fax (301) 827-7103, Email mgnall@oc.fda.gov
<DESC>This announcement is a Sources Sought Synopsis.  Its purpose is to generate responses from qualified 8(a), HUBZONE, veteran owned, woman owned, or small business concerns, which have the interest and ability to provide FDA with access to outpatient and longitudinal drug utilization data.  FDA is not interested in developing a database and expects any qualified organization to own the data as well as the means to access the data.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541990.  Contractors interested in this requirement must submit a capability statement.  A one (1) year base contract with two (2), one (1) year options is intended.  The objectives are: (1) to provide FDA personnel with real-time, immediate, direct, multi-user, desktop access to currently existing, commercially available, longitudinal data with the capability of providing current and historical national-level counts of outpatient prescriptions over time; (2) to provide FDA personnel with real-time, immediate, direct, multi-user, desktop access to currently existing, commercially available, longitudinal data with the capability of providing national-level counts of unique patients utilizing prescription drug products in an outpatient setting over time; (3) to provide patient- and prescription-level information, in either the same or separate, linked resources.  If separate linked data resources are proposed, all individuals in the patient-level data resource shall link directly to their prescription data; (4) to provide FDA personnel with the ability to use these data to characterize the duration of exposure to prescription drug products at a patient level and to examine concomitant use of multiple drug products at a patient level over the same time period; (5) to provide FDA personnel with the ability to use these data to describe national patterns of drug utilization in the outpatient setting through the use of projection or other appropriate methodologies that are scientifically sound and transparent to FDA personnel; (6) to provide FDA personnel with direct, unlimited, Internet or network-based access to all HIPAA-compliant longitudinal data in a multi-user environment and in real time; and (7) to provide FDA personnel with the ability to download (or obtain in a timely manner using other means) large datasets as needed, for the purpose of conducting epidemiological drug safety studies.  These data shall meet the need of the FDA to access patient-level data describing outpatient prescription drug use in individuals over time, i.e., longitudinally.  The longitudinal data shall include information at both the patient and prescription level.  Offerors shall also provide data that will meet FDA¡¯s need for nationally-based, prescription-level outpatient information.  The data shall include historic prescription information at a national level for trend analyses.  The size and characteristics of the population of patients or covered lives from which the patient-level data are derived shall be provided to FDA, since these can affect the quality and usefulness of the data provided and the validity of national projections from the data.  Characteristics shall minimally include: number of individual patients or covered lives; number and percent of patients or covered lives with at least two years of continuous activity; number and percent of patients or covered lives with corresponding enrollment information (if applicable); availability to FDA of enrollment/eligibility/participant inclusion information for use in data analyses; number and percentage of active patients or covered lives in populations of special interest to FDA (including children (ages ¡Ü 17 years) , women of child-bearing age, and elderly (ages ¡Ý 65 years)); turnover or churn rate for participation in the data resource; geographic diversity; demographics; coverage or inclusion policies relevant to pharmaceutical products under health care plans providing the majority of the data (if applicable); and availability to FDA of clinical or medical data (desired, but not required).  If clinical or medical data are available, the number and percent of the total population for whom these data are accessible and detailed information describing how this information is linked to the pharmacy data is required.  In addition, information that will allow FDA to describe and quantify the administration of drug- or biologic products in the outpatient setting by healthcare professionals (e.g., administration of chemotherapy to cancer patients, administration of drugs in conjunction with dialysis) is also desired, if available.  These longitudinal data shall follow uniquely identifiable individuals (using encrypted patient identifiers) over time either across or within ambulatory health care plans.  Age and gender shall be provided.  Information on race/ethnicity shall be included if available, accompanied by documentation of the origin of this information.  Prescription drug utilization data shall be provided and shall include the generic/established name of the drug, strength, dosage form and all dates dispensed (including initial/refill indication), quantity dispensed, days supply and prescriber specialty.  Directions for use and method of payment shall also be included, if available.  Current and historical national-level prescription information shall include counts of prescriptions at both the generic and established name level, as well as information on strength, dosage form, initial/refill indicator, and date (month/year) dispensed.  Current data shall include patient-level demographic information.  Aggregate demographic information related to historical prescription drug use is desired, but not required.  To determine whether the data meet the needs of the FDA for making timely regulatory decisions based on the most current, scientifically valid information available, the following information shall be provided to FDA: the total number of years of data available overall and in real time to FDA personnel; the ability and ease of accessing data that is no longer on-line; and the lag time between the date of service for the patient prescription and on-line availability of the data.  Offerors shall also provide a description of the offeror¡¯s data acquisition process for both the patient- and prescription- level drug utilization data.  All data flow and management procedures shall be described, including data acquisition, cleaning, and editing procedures, data de-identification procedures, specification and description of all coding systems used for diagnoses, procedures and drugs, methods for coding data, percentage of missing or incomplete information and method of coding missing data, availability of raw/sample numbers, as well as projected numbers, and the frequency with which data are updated and methods for updates.  A current and complete data dictionary shall be included.  FDA requires the ability to use both the patient- and prescription-level data to estimate drug utilization patterns in the total U.S. outpatient population, or in a national sub-population of interest (e.g., children (¡Ü 17 years), women of child-bearing age, elderly (¡Ý 65 years)).  This shall require the use of projection or other appropriate methodologies, which shall be valid, reliable, and robust with regard to drug utilization specifically, and the methods fully disclosed.  If such methodology has not been developed, a commitment in the form of a detailed development plan, strategic outline and timeline to collaborate with FDA investigators to develop and implement it within 6 months is required.  Demographics and other relevant characteristics for patients included in the sample to be used for projection or other appropriate methodologies, as well as for the proposed universe, shall be included.  Interested offerrs shall provide (1) a summary list of similar work previously performed or being performed; (2) the professional qualifications and specific experience of staff who may be assigned to the requirement; resumes for proposed key personnel should be included; (3) any other specific and pertinent information as pertains to this Sources Sought Notice that would enhance FDA¡¯s consideration and evaluation of the information submitted.  Responses must reference Request for Information (RFI) number 223-05-3000 and include the following:  (1) name and address of firm, (2) type of business (i.e.: small business, small disadvantaged 8(a) certified, HUBZONE, woman-owned small business, small disadvantaged business (not 8(a) certified), veteran-owned small business, disabled veteran owned business, etc.) (3) two points of contact:  name, title, phone, fax and e-mail, (4) DUNS number, (5) NAICS codes, (6) contractor¡¯s capabilities statement which provides the information stated above, (7) list of customers covering the past 5 years including a summary of animal husbandry work performed, contract number, contract type, dollar value for each customer, reference and customer point of contact with phone number, and identify your role as either the Prime or Subcontractor.

<DESC>Teaming Opportunity for the Astrobiology Science and Technology Instrument Development and Mission Concept Studies NASA Research Announcement (NNH04ZSS001N-ASTID) Description: NASA Langley Research Center is seeking other government agencies, industry, academia, nonprofits, and Federal Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) partners for the Astrobiology Science and Technology Instrument Development and Mission Concept Studies NASA Research Announcement (NRA) (see http://research.hq.nasa.gov/code_s/nra/current/nnh04zss001n/appendB_13.html). Synopsis: The Astrobiology Science and Technology Instrument Development (ASTID) program element requests proposals to develop instrumentation capabilities that will help meet Astrobiology science requirements on future space flight missions, as well as unique Astrobiology science objectives on Earth.  Selected activities are expected to advance the development of scientific instruments or instrument components to the point where the instruments could be credibly proposed in response to future flight opportunity announcements, although proposals to build flight-qualified hardware are not a part of this program element.  In addition, the development of laboratory instruments designed to open a new area of study for Astrobiology will also be considered. In addition, this program element also solicits proposals for Astrobiology mission concepts that may help increase the pool of ideas that may be considered for mission planning, as well as take advantage of mission opportunities such as offered by NASA’s Discovery (http://discovery.nasa.gov/), Explorer (http://fpd.gsfc.nasa.gov/410/), and New Frontiers Programs (http://centauri.larc.nasa.gov/newfrontiers/). Pending the approval of NASA's Fiscal Year 2005 budget, approximately $6M may be available for this year’s support of selections for the ASTID program.	Awards are expected to range from $30K to $300K per year, for a maximum of three years. For mission concept studies, approximately 5-7 studies may be selected for funding, each at the level of $100K - $150K.  For additional information on the scientific goals and objectives of NASA’s Astrobiology program refer to the Astrobiology Roadmap, which is available on the Astrobiology web site at http://astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov/roadmap. NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking partners from other government agencies, industry, academia, nonprofits, and Federal Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) to participate with a NASA LaRC Principal Investigator (PI) in the ASTID Program to develop proposals and assist with instrument definition and development. Subject to the availability of funds, selected proposal(s) would result in contract(s) for the selected partner(s). This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates consistent with the requirements of the NRA. Potential partners must demonstrate the capabilities and experience to provide the instrument components consistent with the efforts synopsized for the specified LaRC proposal. Partners must work collaboratively with NASA and other potential industry and academic partners to perform the required tasks. Partner selection(s) will be made by LaRC based on the following criteria in the following order of importance: (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability and availability of key personnel This criteria evaluates the proposers relevant recent experience, past performance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform the development and key personnel available to support the development. Substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments should be included. (2) Cost and schedule control This criteria evaluates the proposer’s ability to control both cost and schedule. The proposer should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area. (3) Facilities This criterion evaluates the proposer’s facilities (development, testing, and analyses) to conduct the development or demonstration of the proposed task. The proposer should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives. Responses should be limited to 5 pages (12 point font) and address each of the criteria. All responses should be sent to: NASA Langley Research Center, Attn: Rosemary R. Baize, Mail Stop 469 Building 1208A, Room 106, Hampton, VA 23681. The preferred method of submission is via email to: Rosemary.R.Baize@nasa.gov. The due date for submission is COB October 25, 2004. Procurement questions should be directed to Brad Gardner, NASA LaRC Procurement Office, 757-864-2525, Robert.B.Gardner@nasa.gov. The following LaRC technology proposals are seeking partnerships. The technical requirements and NASA LaRC point of contact for questions are provided for each technology proposal: (1) Energy Dispersive Detectors for use in X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometers Technical Point of Contact: Warren C. Kelliher, 757-864-4172, warren.c.kelliher@nasa.gov NASA Langley Research Center is actively developing X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometers (XRFS) for use on future Planetary and Space Exploratory missions to provide elemental analysis of various regolith surfaces. Based on previous experience with the XRFS used on the Viking Mission to Mars, Langley is developing state-of-the-art XRFS components to be used in different instrument configurations for in-situ analysis, remote surface analysis and subsurface analysis. We are also interested in further development of micro and total reflection XRFS technologies for space applications. For this specific proposal, Langley is interested in developing new energy dispersive detectors for use in an XRFS that are not sensitive to the visible light spectrum, yet still have reasonable sensitivity to the low fluorescence energies of the biogenic elements such as Carbon, Nitrogen & Oxygen. We are particularly interested in the radiation resistant, wide bandgap, semiconductor single crystals such as Diamond and Silicon Carbide. Langley is interested in partners with the capability of growing and doping these crystals and assisting in the evaluation of their use as an energy dispersive detector for the x-ray photon region.

<SUBJECT>R -- Request for Information - integrated Network Enhanced Telemetry (iNET) Study
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), 412 TW/DRP (ACQ), seeks information from Industry under the integrated Network Enhanced Telemetry (iNET) Project to augment current telemetry systems with network technology to meet emerging needs within the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB).  This request for information encompasses required technical services inherent in communications systems engineering.  BACKGROUND.  The Director of the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) launched the integrated Network Enhanced Telemetry (iNET) Study.  The iNET Study was tasked to define an experimental Telemetry Network System (TmNS) architecture that incorporates the documented needs of the RDT&E community.  The Study documentation forms the foundation of the iNET Project.  The iNET Project will develop the needed technologies to mature a TmNS and guide its deployment at MRTFB sites throughout DoD. TELEMETRY NETWORK SYSTEM.  The concept of Network Enhanced Telemetry that will be embodied in the Telemetry Network System is to augment current telemetry systems with network technology.  Current communications links based on the IRIG 106 standard are one-way, dedicated links.  Two-way communications links can be shared to provide flexible operation and improved spectrum efficiency.  The deployed TmNS will transport information from the data source (test vehicle) to the engineering station.  The architecture for this Network Enhanced Telemetry system and the selection or development of technologies for the TmNS must be based on the needs of the T&E community, including programs and ranges, so that the resulting products will be utilized throughout the community.  In addition, the iNET Project will investigate the feasibility of employing the Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA) and the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) software defined radios.  The iNET development will emphasize the use of commercial off the shelf (COTS) equipment and/or modified COTS. REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  This announcement serves to facilitate development of requirements for the iNET post study phase, and is NEITHER a sources sought synopsis nor is it a solicitation.   This request for information is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government.  Interested entities are encouraged to respond by providing their company name, technical and contractual points of contact, and detailed written recommendations and input under this RFI.  Collaboration between the commercial telecommunications business base with the traditional telemetry business base is strongly encouraged.  The iNET Study documentation is currently pending public release and will be posted at this site when available.  Written responses shall be sent via U.S. Mail, express/overnight deliveries, or courier service for receipt at Edwards AFB no later than 4:30 PM (local time) on 15 Nov 2004, addressed to Joanne Eldredge, Directorate of Contracting, AFFTC/PKDD, 5 S Wolfe Ave., Bldg 2800, Edwards AFB, CA 93524.  All questions and comments are to be submitted to Joanne Eldredge at e-mail: joanne.eldredge@edwards.af.mil, voice (661) 277-7707 or fax (661) 275-7852.  Electronic submissions are not acceptable under this RFI. The identified NAICS Code under this RFI is 541330 Engineering Services, as an NAICS Code is required to post under FedBizOpps.  However, Industry is advised that the NAICS Code is subject to change in the near future based upon a more definitive identification under the iNET Project. The Government will not pay for any information received from potential sources under this RFI.  This request for information is for information and planning purposes only.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Buffer Pool Tool Site License
<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Responsive Systems Company of Morganville, NJ to upgrade the current licensing authority of SSA’s software product Buffer Pool Tool from a leased license to a full initial site license.  The period of performance will be October 1, 2004 through September 30, 2005.  SSA currently leases this software from Responsive Systems Company under Purchase Order SS00-05-50017.  This software is used to collect DB2 buffer pool statistics for each object (tablespace/index).  These statistics are used to tune the buffer pools by allowing the assignment of similar objects to the same buffer pool.  SSA uses this software to enhance performance of the subsystems and the corresponding applications.  The Buffer Pool Tool software is currently installed on SSA’s mainframe System 81 (IBM z900 2064-1C9, S/N 11D63, 302 MSUs), System 91 (IBM z/990 2084-303, S/N 73F2C, 191 MSUs) and, System 92 (IBM z/990 2084-303, S/N 73F3C, 191 MSUs) located at the National Computer Center, Baltimore, Maryland.  The ability to process workloads at a future second site will also be included in the upgraded licensing authority.  Responsive Systems Company is the only known source capable of satisfying SSA’s requirements for license upgrading and maintenance support of the Buffer Pool Tool software.  SSA is not looking to replace the current software at this time.  This licensing upgrade is for economic purposes only.  Other organizations possessing the requisite expertise and resources are invited to submit information concerning their capabilities, experience, and other pertinent data (including GSA Schedule information) within 
15 calendar days from the date of this announcement.  Pricing data may be submitted. This is not a request for proposal and the Government does not intend to pay for information submitted. Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of the information received. No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received; however, this information will be used in SSA's assessment of capable sources. Verbal responses are not acceptable and will not be considered. Responses to this notice must be submitted by 10/28/04. Responses can be sent via email to Angie Landis at Angie.Landis@ssa.gov.

Increasing military contingencies have created a situation where the capability to produce small caliber ammunition through conventional methods have been fully exercised.  A Second Source Prime Contractor for Small Caliber Ammunition is anticipated to  remedy the current situation by arranging for capability to deliver up to 300 million rounds per year for a five-year period to the U.S. Government.  Quantities could increase up to 500 million per year. The AFSC is seeking sources interested in the Second Source Prime Contractor concept.  To that extent, the Army intends to issue a formal Request for Proposal (RFP), anticipated in January 2005.  A competitive award of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract for  establishment of the Second Source Prime Contractor, followed by Firm Fixed Price (FFP) delivery orders for small caliber ammunition, with the source that provides the best value proposal to the formal RFP is anticipated.     A Pre-Solicitation Conference will be held at the RiverCenter, Davenport, Iowa on 1 December 2004 beginning at 0900 hours.  At that time, industry questions in reference to the draft RFP issued 6 October 2004, will be considered and addressed.  Sources int erested in attending the Pre-Solicitation Conference must contact the Contract Specialist, Ms. Kristin Engelken, with the name of your firm and the number of personnel attending, by 27 October 2004 at AMSFS-CCA-F, 1 Rock Island Arsenal, Rock Island, IL 612 99-6500, (309)782-7345, or kristin.l.engelken@us.army.mil.  Additionally, you are encouraged to submit questions that may be answered at the Pre-Solicitation Conference in reference to the draft RFP issued 6 October 2004,  NLT 1 November 2004 to the point of contact above.  A formal agenda will be sent out to registered participants at a later date.

<DESC>DARE COUNTY WETLAND RESTORATION
SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION: FA4809-04-Q-0399
SEPT. 20, 2004 SITE VISIT MINUTES

SITE VISIT START: 0730	                                                         SITE VISIT END: 0830

	The following subjects and questions were discussed at the September 20, 2004 site visit at the Navy Dare Co. Bomb Range (DCBR) for synopsis/solicitation FA4809-04-Q-0399, Dare Co. Wetland Restoration Magnolia/Spring Roads:

1)	Mr. Doug Back of USAF DCBR Forestry began the site visit explaining the roadbed area and elevation.

a)	Mr. Back stated that the roadbed elevation on both Magnolia and Spring roads grades down from 3’ above the canal water level to the canal water level itself.

2)	Mr. Back stated that all vegetation on the right side of the roadbed must be pushed into the canal to match the roadbed level to the level of the canal on the right-hand side.

3)	Mr. Back stated that there is not enough fill dirt to totally fill the canal, so the contractor must push the brush into the canal in 100’ to 200’ segments in accordance with pg. 11 of the Statement of Work.

4)	Mr. Back stated that he will mark the left side of both Magnolia and Spring Roads with color coated flags


a)	Mr. Back stated that the orange flags will mark the sections of the “Enhancement Area” to be pushed back.
b)	Blue flags will mark the sections of the “Enhancement Area” not to be touched.
c)	Mr. Back stated that the areas are determined to remove Sweet Gum and Red Maple to make room for the new species.

5)	The question was asked as to what the contractor should do if they encounter small patches of Sweet Gum and Red Maple not in flagged areas to be pushed down.

a)	Mr. Back answered that they should be left in place if not in designated “push down” areas of the “Enhancement Area” by the appropriate orange flags.

6)	Mr. Back stated that all brush and trees pushed down in the “Enhancement Area” may be left in place.

7)	Mr. Back also stated that Deer predation and other types of animal predation and destruction on the tree seedlings are not counted toward the 80% survival rate of seedlings as stated on pg. 5 of the Statement of Work.

8)	Mr. Back asked whether the large rusted machinery frame that is dumped in the “Enhancement Area” of Magnolia Rd. could be buried in the canal section.

a)  Johanna Arnold stated the piece of equipment shall be left in place and not moved or placed in the canal section.  Pushing in the Enhancement Area near the machinery shall be done around the equipment.

9)	Mr. Joe Lafferty, DCBR Range Manager, stated that the period of performance is still Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays as stated in the Statement of Work.  However, the contractor may coordinate times during the Monday-Friday workweek on a day-by-day basis with Mr. Lafferty.

10)	 Mr. Lafferty asked how long it would take to plant the 6,000 tree seedlings proposed 
       in the Statement of Work

a)	Contractors stated that one day should be sufficient    
      to complete the planting of all 6,000 tree seedlings.

11)	The question was asked as to whether the debris on the right side of   
       the roadbed should be moved into the canal.

a)	Mr. Back said yes, all debris from the right-hand side may be used in the canal.

12)	 The question was asked as to if the contractor would be allowed to de-water the canal 
       section.

a)	Mr. Back stated that the contractor could de-water the canal only while working and not permanently.

13)	 The contractors asked if an excavator could be used to uproot and bury the brush and 
       trees from the left-hand “Enhancement Area” side of the roadbed. 
a)	Mr. Back stated that it would be allowed.

The following minutes were taken between the hours of 0900 and 0940 while completing a site visit on Magnolia Rd. with the 3 contractors who arrived late to the site visit:

1)	Mr. Back explained that work began on both Magnolia Rd. and Spring Rd. past the blue flag markers.

2)	Mr. Back stated that he would provide dimensions on how far to push back brush marked in the “Enhancement Area”.

3)	The contractors asked what was to be done with the water that is in the canal sections to be filled when the contractor fills the 100’ to 200’ sections.
a) Mr. Back stated that the water will either stay and move naturally or be de-     
                  watered for this project only and not permanently by the contractor.

4)	Mr. Back stated that the roadbed will be pushed into the canal sections from the point where the roadbed meets normal elevation on the left side “Enhancement Area” all the way into the right side canal.

5)	Mr. Back stated that the tree seedlings may be 1yr. old seedlings.

6)	Mr. Back stated that herbicide is not permitted.

7)	Mr. Back suggested that the contractor start from the backside of the roadbed on both Magnolia and Spring Roads and move forward towards the road entrances.

8)	Mr. Back stated that there will be a one-time pre-job meeting with the awarded contractor prior to the actual project performance.

The following statement was received by Mr. Doug Back on September 20, 2004 following the Dare Co. site visit:


            The segments of the enhancement areas (east side) to be pushed or reserved have been flagged as we discussed at the site visit.  The totals for each road are as follows:

Magnolia           Push 3823 feet              Reserve 1926 feet          Total 5749 feet

Spring               Push 2356 feet              Reserve 3439 feet          Total 5795 feet

Total                 Push 6179 feet              Reserve 5365 feet          Total 11,544 feet
 
            Areas between 2 orange flags are to be pushed.
            Areas between 2 blue flags are to be reserved.
 
            The large piece of discarded equipment we saw is located on the east side of Magnolia Road approximately 612 feet south of the Air Force/Wildlife Refuge property line.
