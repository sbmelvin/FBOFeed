B.	 TECHNICAL TOPIC AREAS:

	(1)TITLE: SALSA (Systems for Airborne Laser Sensing and Analysis) (+/- $12M) 

This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) requests proposals for laser imaging and sensor technologies for application to long range target identification systems.  Technology applicable to range gated laser illuminated systems operating in the 1.5?m band is of particular interest.  The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Phillips Research Site (PRS), Directed Energy Directorate (DEBS), Kirtland AFB, NM solicits proposals to develop research in advanced laser system and sensor technologies, and potential dual-use scientific research that enhances AFRL/DE programs and requirements.  The program is especially interested in the following objective areas:

a.  Sensor Manufacturing Technology Development.  The introduction and investigation of new sensor manufacturing approaches with emphasis on imaging sensors for use in high performance eye-safe laser systems.  The goal of the program is to establish a pilot production line which demonstrates the capability to manufacture sensors with methods conducive to high volume production of cost effective, high performance sensors.

b.  Eye-safe Range Gated Component Development.  Research, analysis, development, and demonstration of technologies and components associated with active laser imaging for applications such as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR).  Development of hardware for sensors suitable for use with eye-safe lasers for commercial and military applications for use in range gated imaging systems is desired.  

c. Technical Analysis, Science, and Engineering for Laser Imaging Systems.  
Concept and system operation developments for activities such as UAV or active satellite sensing and imaging (including geo-synchronous satellite imaging), applications and technologies.  The contractor shall develop air, space, and UAV-borne platform approaches and capabilities to terrain imaging, target identification, remote sensing, and target designation.  This activity may include design, fabrication, and test of eye-safe laser imaging systems for Airborne, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Ground-to-space, or space-borne systems.


(2)TITLE:  High Energy Laser Mobile Active Tracking Testbed (HELMATT) (+/-  $21M)

The AFRL solicits proposals in research and development of a mobile test-bed (in either a ground or pod-mounted configuration) for the operational assessment of active and passive sensors in the development of tracking, discrimination, targeting and propagation of laser beams and of sensor fusion algorithms and concepts. The test-bed may support a combination of active and passive sensors such as:  laser radar (ladar); microdoppler sensors; active illuminators; target designators; infrared (IR) spectrum sensors; mid-wave infrared (MWIR) sensors and multispectral sensors. The test-bed will support tracking and discrimination in cluttered background in support of tactical high-energy laser (HEL) and/or advanced tactical laser (ATL) targeting mission as well as missile defense and advanced sensor missions such as chemical/biological agent identification and optical tagging. Further it is anticipated that system demonstration of discrimination and tracking concepts will be at AFRL facilities such as the Starfire Optical Range (SOR), North Oscura Peak (NOP) and the Maui Space Surveillance Site (MSSS), and at the contractor site.  Networking of multiple units in multi-static geometries will enhance the tracking, discrimination and targeting capability of the tested sensor system. It is envisioned that a system of portable, networked, stabilized, active and passive configurable mobile test bed units will part of a configuration of sensing nodes within the Hawaii Surveillance Network. 


(3)Title: Relay Mirror Technology Enhancement (+/- $15M)

The AFRL has interest in research, analysis, development, and demonstration of technologies to improve current state of the art in acquisition, tracking, and pointing, beam control, and surveillance together fire control solutions for HEL employment through and with relay mirror systems. These technologies include but are not limited to adaptive optics, liquid crystal and MEMS wavefront control components, throughput enhancement, dual line of sight pointing and tracking, large light weight optics, large dynamic range wavefront control, fast steering mirrors and inertial reference systems.

No further evaluation factors will be used in selecting proposals.  The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of each offeror?s proposal, both technical and cost to determine the overall merit of the proposals. The technical aspect is ranked as the first order of priority and is significantly more important than cost, however, cost/price is a substantial consideration in selection proposals for award. AFRL reserves the right to select for award any, all, part or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement, subject to the availability of funds.  When requested, a debriefing will be provided IAW FAR 15.505 and 15.506.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure custom content and delivery of consumer oriented health news for inclusion in the MEDLINEplus website on a sole source basis from Pinnacor Inc. and Reuters Health Information Services Inc., New York, NY, for a continuation of existing services with NLM.  MEDLINEplus is NLM's web-based consumer information resource that includes health topic pages, drug information and other links to Internet resources of interest to the consumer.  NLM extracts and displays headlines from the content with hypertext links to the full text of the corresponding news story both from the Library's portal pages and/or, as appropriate, from the more than 570 topic pages on the website.  Currently, MEDLINEplus receives over 12 million page hits per month.  The inclusion of current health and medical news is an important feature of this highly respected web site.  Pinnacor Inc. is an aggregator providing sophisticated software for the distribution of digital content via the Internet.  It draws content from a large number of national and international content providers including such high quality sources as AP World Stream, Agence France-Presse, the Christian Science Monitor, the New York Times Syndicate, Deutche Presse Agentur, and United Press International.  Pinnacor also offers delivery of Reuters HealtheLine provided the content is licensed directly.  Pinnacor's "Site Ware" product delivers custom filtered content in real-time.  NLM staff can efficiently select stores from the filtered content for delivery to the NLM website through a secure protocol over the Internet for integration into the MEDLINEplus website.  The content is resident on the NLM site with no "link-out".  The provider offers a choice of delivery methods including XML, NLM's preferred delivery method.  MEDLINEplus selection staff, are fully trained on the Pinnacor "Editor's Desk", used to select, edit, and promote stories to the MEDLINEplus database.  The MEDLINEplus input system has also been programmed to receive and process the specific fields provided by Pinnacor, storing them in an Oracle database for daily builds on MEDLINEplus.  Continuing to receive the news feed from Pinnacor will avoid the need for costly, and time consuming reprogramming of the input system and retraining of MEDLINEplus staff members.  Reuters extensive network of journalists attends and reports from more than 1,000 medical meetings and scientific symposia in the U.S. and abroad where results are often released before they appear in journals.  In addition they have access to leading journals pre-embargo which enables them to develop background and supplementary information in time to release the related story by the embargo date. The Reuters HealtheLine provides original content mass media stories written primarily for the health consumer.  Topics covered include health and wellness, biomedical research findings, new drug information, new disease treatments, and information on specific diseases and treatments.  Continued service from  the original sources are necessary to assure the continued delivery of high quality news stories essential to a major information service provided by the library.  No other sources or combination of sources provides the same breadth and timeliness of news coverage as Pinnacor and Reuters.  Further awards to any other sources would result in  both substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  The period of performance is anticipated for a period of twelve (12) months with two (2) one-year option periods.  The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items.  This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner which will be considered by NLM. Firms interested in responding to the notice must be able to provide the services as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposal must include pricing information.  Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions Management, 8600 Rockville Pike, Building 38A, Room B1N20, Bethesda, Maryland 20894, Attention: Uyen H.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The NHLBI is seeking a small business with the ability to serve as a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for a new five-year multi-center research program, the Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC).   The LTRC will be a network of centers cooperating to harvest and process lung tissue specimen with corresponding clinical data for use in scientific studies of the pathogenesis of lung diseases, especially chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.  The goal of the LTRC is to enable better management of lung diseases by increasing understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms of these diseases through molecular histopathological studies of human lung tissues with and without disease.  The LTRC will facilitate histopathological research of pulmonary diseases by preparing and distributing collections of tissue specimens obtained at surgery to researchers.  Collections of specimens will be linked to extensive clinical data appropriate to the specific disease.  Donor subjects will be recruited for specific enrollment groups that are designed to address important research questions.  The consortium will be comprised of Clinical Centers (CCs), a Tissue Processing and Distribution Center (TC), a Radiology Center (RC), and the DCC.  The Principal Investigator of the DCC will be a senior scientist with expertise in managing data bases from large clinical studies and demonstrated leadership experience in conducting multi-center research studies.  The DCC will provide biostatistical expertise in support of protocol development, including power and sample size calculations.  The Principal Investigator will be responsible for the statistical approaches and the overall performance within the DCC.  The DCC will:  plan and make all arrangements for the meetings and calls of the Steering Committee (SC), Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC), and Observational Study Monitoring Board (OSMB); participate and assist the TC in arrangements for site visits of the CCs by the TC; verify that potential subjects identified by the CCs are eligible for recruitment into specific enrollment groups; assign unique subject identifier numbers to eligible subjects and authorize the CC to proceed with clinical characterization and specimen procurement; coordinate the electronic transfer of clinical data from the CCs to the DCC; maintain an electronic repository of clinical data collected from LTRC subjects together with descriptive histopathological reports from the TC, descriptive reports, and radiographic measures of lung disease from the RC; maintain computer software necessary to process, store, and analyze data furnished by the CCs, TC, and RC; maintain a liaison with each CC to assist in the solution of operational problems involved in data collection and reporting; assist CC staff in data management and administrative functions; prepare public use data sets corresponding to tissue collections prepared by the TC; direct the TC and the RC to provide specified LTRC resources and public use data sets to investigators approved for access; perform statistical analyses for investigators for research studies that utilize LTRC materials; prepare progress reports of the LTRC; develop, maintain and enhance the LTRC web site, and receive, process, and submit to the NHLBI requests from LTRC and external investigators for LTRC specimens or data.  A Steering Committee, consisting of the NHLBI Project Officer and the Principal Investigator from each center awarded a contract, will meet during Phase I to develop the LTRC Protocol Manual.  Upon completion, the LTRC Protocol Manual will be submitted for review to an independent SAC appointed by the NHLBI.  During Phase II, the SAC will provide peer review of requests for access to LTRC materials (specimens and data) and of research studies proposed by the CCs.  An OSMB will be appointed by the NHLBI to monitor the protection of human research subjects and the overall progress and performance of the LTRC.  This is not a request for proposals (RFP) and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement.  Small business concerns that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this study should submit complete documentation of their capabilities to the Contracting Officer at the above noted address.  The capabilities statement submitted in response to this synopsis shall include 1) the total number of employees, 2) the professional qualifications of scientist, and technical personnel in accordance with the above outline requirements, 3) a description of general and specific facilities and equipment available, including computer equipment and software, and 4) an outline of previous multi-center research projects in which the small business organization and the proposed personnel have participated and any other information considered relevant to this program.  The information provided must also establish the institution?s status as a small business.  Three copies of the capabilities statement must be received at the address listed above fifteen days from the publication date of this announcement.  If this program is approved for implementation and it is determined to be a small business set aside, then a competitive RFP will be set aside for small business concerns.  The RFP will be available in FedBizOpps and electronically via the NHLBI Website: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/inits/index.htm#rfp.
