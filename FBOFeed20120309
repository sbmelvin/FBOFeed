<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK
CONSTRUCTION SERVICES FOR PROJECT 620A4-11-106
INSTALL FRONT GATE TRAFFIC CONTROL CENTER 
AND INCREASE SURFACE PARKING AT CASTLE POINT CAMPUS


BACKGROUND:
Recent world events have precipitated changes in the requirements for security at all public and government facilities.  As a result of these changes VA policies for public safety and security have been focused on providing increased patient, employee, and public safety.  In order to comply with these directives it is necessary that the VA Castle Point campus reconfigure the main entrance for the campus to provide better screening of the incoming traffic by the VA Police department.  In addition to increased security, the project will also be much safer for our police to perform this vital task than the current arrangement which requires that they stand in the oncoming traffic lane.  

The Castle Point campus also serves a very rural area with little to no public transportation available for patients, employees, or visitors.  Due to this fact it becomes very difficult for patients to find parking spots near the main entrance of the hospital.  VA guidelines state that patient parking is supposed to be situated as close to the main entrance of the hospital.  In order to accomplish this, we need to expand one of the existing parking lots. 
OBJECTIVES:
This Project will install a front gate traffic control center and increase surface parking at Castle Point campus.  Recent security mandates require increased security screening. The current arrangement of the front gate poses grave safety risks for the VA Police officers tasked with manning it.  The new building will enhance the ability of the VA Police department to both screen incoming traffic and to increase traffic flow rates into and out of the facility at peak hours.  In addition it will allow for a further increase of much needed inpatient and visitor parking closer to the main hospital entrance and patient care wards.  It will accomplish this by moving staff and government owned vehicle parking to an extension of an existing parking lot.

SCOPE: 
Base Bid:
The contractor will furnish all materials, equipment, supervision, and personnel necessary to accomplish the work set forth in the provided specifications and drawings titled Install Front Gate Traffic Control Center and Increase Surface Parking at Castle Point Campus.  The contractor will be required to comply with all applicable VA specifications, regulations, procedures.  The contractor will also be required to comply with any applicable Federal, State, and local laws, statutes, and regulations.  

Contractor will make all efforts to minimize disruptions to the normal traffic flow patterns of the medical facility.  In order to accomplish this, it is anticipated that the contractor will need to accomplish some aspects of the project during off hours and weekends.  Any off hours and weekend work will not incur additional costs to the government.

The Certification and Accreditation requirements do not apply to this project.
Deduct Alternate:
Contractor is to provide deduct alternate for removal of the items denoted inclusive of Increase Surface Parking Phase 1, Increase Surface Parking Phase 2, Increase Surface Parking Phase 3, and Increase Surface Parking Phase 4 as shown on drawing number GC-101, detail #6, dated 7/12/2011

SAFETY CODES/CERTIFICATION/LICENSING:
Contractor will be required to abide by all applicable VA, Federal, State, and Local safety codes, laws, and regulations that apply.
TRAVEL:
Contractor does not have any special requirements for travel. Travel to and from the contractors place of business to the place of performance is included in the price of the contract. 
REQUIREMENTS UNIQUE TO SOLICITATION:
Contractor will make all efforts to minimize disruption of traffic patterns at medical center.  This may require that the contractor work off hours and weekends.  Off hour and weekend work will be accomplished at no additional cost to the government.  A detailed phasing plan will be provided to the government as part of the submittal process and must be approved before work commences.

NTP for this project will not be held until Spring of 2013 due to conflicts with other projects.

The required services include the following tasks:
1.  General Dam Site Surveillance Inspections2.  Gate Changes3.  Vegetation Mowing4.  Miscellaneous Maintenance Activities
While Reclamation maintains the ultimate responsibility for the operation and maintenance of Jamestown Dam, the local area office had neither the personnel nor the equipment to successfully conduct all required O&M services at the dam.  Therefore, Reclamation has found the City of Dickinson to be the only source with local knowledge and experience necessary to successfully complete the required O&M services on an as-needed basis.
This procurement is being conducted pursuant to Part 12 and Part 13 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.  Since Reclamation believes that only one responsible source can fully provide the services that will satisfy the agency's requirements, a Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition has been prepared and approved by the Great Plains Regional Office Chief of Contracting.

Responses received after April 6, 2012 may not be considered by the Government.
Responses to this notice shall be mailed to the Bureau of Reclamation - GP-5000; 316 North 26th Street; Billings, Montana 59101, or faxed to 406-247-7798, Attn:  Christine Mundt, or e-mailed to cmundt@usbr.gov.

Vendors shall additionally identify themselves as either a "small business" or an "other than small business" under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 561210.

The NAICS code for this procurement is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing.<br /><br />The purpose of this acquisition is to purchase Leap Combi-PAL autosampler to be used on a GS-MS system. The estimated period of performance of this acquisition is 60 days from the date the order is placed.<br /><br />Leap Technologies is the only responsible source capable of meeting the Government's requirement because they are the only vendor with a product that allows for direct sampling out of the sample container type (tedlar bag), which is necessary for study due to sample stability and potential loss of sample if the sample was to be transferred to another container. In addition, the current method has been developed on a Leap system. It is essential that we stay with that platform for experimental consistency and compatibility. If the system was changed, a new method would need to be developed and could not be supported in-house. The Leap system is compatible with current analyses and, therefore, is the best choice from a method transfer and support viewpoint. It is also the only system that will allow for direct analysis of a sample in its container. Thus, Leap Technologies, Inc., the manufacturer of the Leap system, is the only company that can be used.<br /><br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Leap Technologies, Inc. However, firms that believe they can meet these requirements are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notice by providing a capability statement to the Contracting Officer by March 24, 2012. <strong>The Contracting Officer will not respond to verbal requests. All requests must be in writing. <br /></strong><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

The estimated period of performance of this acquisition is 60 days from the date of award.<br /><br />As the original equipment manufacturer of the smoking machine, which is currently in use, and the carbon monoxide analyzer, which is needed, Borgwaldt is the only contractor that can provide the required equipment. Only the Borgwaldt RM20H carbon monoxide analyzer is designed to work with the Borgwaldt smoking machines. It is designed to attach to the Borgwaldt smoking machine and to interface with the machine as part of its daily QC process as well as to measure the carbon monoxide generated by cigarettes as they are smoked on the machine. Accordingly, because no other manufacturer has developed or sells a carbon monoxide analyzer for Borgwaldt smoking machines, Borgwaldt KC, Inc. is the only responsible source capable of meeting the Government's requirement.<br /><br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps.

<DESC><strong>This Pre-Solicitation Notice is for information purposes only. This is not a request for submission of proposals or qualifications. RESPONSES OR OTHER INQUIRIES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME.<br /><br /></strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) intends to issue a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotations (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Disposable Blood Pressure Cuffs <strong>on or about June 2012</strong> but the actual issue date for this RFIAQ may be delayed up to forty-five (45) business days.<br /><br />The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements, plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <br /><br />Examples of items being solicited could include, but are not limited to Disposable Blood Pressure Cuffs to include at a minimum line items in the following products in the following sizes: small, adult, adult long and adult large with tubing, adapters and fittings. The estimated value of the resultant Incentive Agreement (IA) will be approximately $981,029.74 annually. <br /><br />NOTE: This initiative will be part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program which is executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel and standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. To participate in this Standardization Action (SA) your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Mino or be in the process of obtaining a DAPA and a separate commercial agreement with Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from the solicitation is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program, please access the DLA web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil. <strong>Vendor must update their DAPA numbers for this product line in the DAPA Management System with the country from which each line item is an end product, IAW the Trade Agreements Act. Vendors responding to the solicitation will be required to ensure that all DAPA line items/end products in the subject product line list the proper Trade Agreements Act country.<br /><br /></strong>Detailed information about the requirements and selection process will be provided in the RFIAQ. The purpose of this Pre-Solicitation Notice is to inform qualified entities interested in providing these services that the release of the RFIAQ is imminent. Upon issuance of the RFIAQ, all solicitation information will be available electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities website. <br />

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Inflammatory Disease Section intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Sequenom Inc., 3595 John Hopkins Court, San Diego, California 92121-1121 to provide a Premier service plan for NHGRI's Sequenom MassARRAY System.<br /><br />The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Inflammatory Disease Branch has a critical need for maintenance and repair service plan for Sequenom's MassARRAY technology which is designed for custom-designed, medium to high throughput genotyping that has been optimized to achieve unprecedented levels of cost effectiveness and throughput. Inflammatory Disease Section requires both maintenance and repair service for this critical, but sensitive equipment in order to continue uninterrupted work critical to the mission of the NHGRI. Obtaining maintenance and service without a service contract in place would result in significant equipment down-time and work delays. Sequenom is the sole manufacturer of this system. The parts and software are unique to these instruments and cannot be substituted or supplied by those from other vendors. The engineers from Sequenom have the in-depth proprietary knowledge and training to repair and maintain these complex machines. They also provide updates to the equipment and the software and protocols to conform to the latest available techniques.</p>
<p>Sequenom's MassARRAY technology meets the demands of our laboratory for efficient generation of genotypes for fine-mapping regions previously identified by genome-wide association analysis, for validation and association analysis of novel single nucleotide polymorphisms identified via next generation sequencing, and for targeted genotyping performed to identify novel genetic factors associated with complex diseases. A major focus of the laboratory is the genetic analysis of common, but genetically complex diseases. NHGRI work begins with genome-wide association studies that require the genotyping of over 1000 cases and 1000 controls for over 1 million markers distributed throughout the genome. The current system in the laboratory is composed of three parts. 1) The Multimek Liquid Handler is a dedicated robotic system that processes sample reactions in 384-well plates, performing all pipeting post-PCR steps of the genotyping protocol in a semi-automated fashion. The system is currently being used to simultaneously process 384 samples in a single plate for up to 36 different single nucleotide variants (13,824 genotypes per single plate). Custom-designed oligonucleotides are used to PCR amplify up to 36 amplicons in a single reaction. The Liquid Handler is used to pipet the dephosphorylation enzymatic reagents, to add the oligonucleotide extension reagents that are used to extend the complimentary oligonucleotides according to the variants present in the amplicons, and to dispense a cation absorptive resin to prepare the products for analysis by mass spectrometry. This allows the user to custom design assays for the specific sequence variants desired for analysis. 2) The Samsung LT Nanodispenser is a different dedicated robotic system that transfers and dispenses nanoliter quantities of the 384 completed reaction products onto the surface of a matrix-prespotted proprietary 6 square centimeter chip that permits the analysis of the products by matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry. 3) The Mass Array Compact System functions to separate and detect the reaction products by virtue of tiny differences in mass. The system includes a proprietary state of the art laser driven mass spectrometer, which together with proprietary software, interprets the mass spectra to generate genotypes on the basis of detection of the alternate extension products. The mass spectrometer is controlled by a dedicated computer (the RT workstation) and interacts with a database on a second dedicated computer.</p>
<p>The Premier Service Plan Package provides one (1) preventative maintenance visit and unlimited emergency visits. Costs are to include labor, parts and travel. The MassARRAY&reg; System Components covered by the service plan are:</p>
<p>1. MassARRAY Compact System, Premier Service Plan: Compact Serial Number: BA070008, Catalog Number: 63006, RT Workstation Serial Number: 2UA70610K5, Quantity: One (1) Each.<br />2.

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) and the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI), located on the Walter Reed National Military Medical Campus (WRNMMC) in Bethesda, MD, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Harlan Laboratories N.A., Inc. for laboratory animal feed and bedding.
<p><br />This order is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items) and FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisition Procedures).</p>
<p>Sole source determination is made in accordance with:</p>
<p>FAR Part 13.106-1 Soliciting Competition</p>
<p>(b) Soliciting from a single source</p>
<p>(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.</p>
<p>The laboratory animals have been fed and housed on Harlan Laboratories products since their arrival at USUHS and AFRRI. The current animals have been acclimated to Harlan products and prior studies have generated data based on Harlan Products. Switching food and bedding would introduce subclinical physiological changes, causing variables that could negatively impact ongoing and future research. The types of research being conducted include molecular biology, neurobiology, neuropsychology and infectious disease. Harlan Laboratories currently provides specific animal feed and bedding (Teklad Global 20% Protein Primate Diet Jumbo, Teklad Rodent Diet and Teklad "Maple" Sani Chip Bedding), which have a predictable quality control and influence on the outcome of research. Changing vendors would add uncertain variability into experimental animal conditions which could have a detrimental effect on the course of research.</p>
<p>This is not a request for quotes and a solicitation package will not be issued. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Responses must be submitted electronically, via email, to Jody.Bester@usuhs.mil by 4:00 PM (EST) on March 16, 2012.</p>

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT

TITLE OF PROJECT:  PEER SUPPORT CERTIFICATION TRAINING CONTRACT

1.	PURPOSE.   The purpose of this contract is to provide the training and certification for peer support specialists and peer support technicians. VHA's Psychosocial Rehabilitation and Recovery Services Section in the Office of Mental Health Services (OMHS) has been charged with developing and approving peer support certification training services.  Daniel O'Brien-Mazza, the Director of Peer Support Services for the Office of Mental Health Services, is responsible for the program of peer support in VA's mental health programs.  

2.	BACKGROUND.  Peer support services were formally initiated in VHA mental health programs in 2006 with funding that enhanced mental health programs with recovery-oriented services, and a Director of Peer Support Services in OMHS was hired in 2007. Prior to the passage of Public Law 110-387 in October 2008, peers hired in VHA were not required to be certified to provide peer services. The passage of this law as well as Public Law 111-163 (passed in May 2010) not only required that peer support specialists in VHA be certified by an appropriate peer certification program but also provided authorization for VHA to develop a national contract with a not-for-profit agency to provide training for Veterans to provide peer support services. Peer support services are an essential component of transforming VHA's mental health programs to the recovery model and are required by VHA Handbook 1160.01, Uniform Mental Health Services in VA Medical Centers and Clinics

3.	Objectives.   The contracting vendor will provide current and future VA employed peer support technicians or specialists with training, resulting in their being fully prepared to take a certification examination.   The training must be provided to these employees regardless of the presence or absence of a mental health or substance use disorder history.  This training must cover the competencies and skills for peer support services in mental health programs as defined by OMHS and described in the Specific Tasks and Deliverables Section below.    

4.	Scope.  The Contractor shall provide the required labor and materials to develop and present a peer support specialist training and certification program for VA employees nationwide. It is estimated that up to 40 peer support technicians, not to exceed the budgeted amount allocated for this contract will participate in this training the first year.  Contractors shall submit a quality control plan that contains, at a minimum, a description of the inspection system to cover all services including areas to be inspected and the schedule of inspection, a description of the methods used for indentifying and preventing defects in the quality of services and a description of the records to be kept to document inspections and any corrective/preventive actions taken in advance of the award of the contract

Services: Peer support certification training (including didactic, experiential, and multimedia modalities) covering the 34 competencies VHA has designated as required for peer support staff are identified in the Specific Tasks and Deliverables section below. Some competencies marked with an asterisk in the list of mandatory tasks must have an experiential component that includes role playing and provides for demonstration of those skills in order to establish competencies. 

Training for the competencies that do not require the face-to-face experiential modality may be provided through in-person training or through completion of workbook materials, manuals, or online learning conducted prior to the experiential training.  Attachment  (D) has been included which gives details of guidelines and expectations VHA will use to evaluate the responses to this proposal.  Attachment (E), VA Reviewer Rating Tool to Evaluate Peer Support Certification Training RFPs, is the actual tool the VA review team will use in evaluating submitted proposals.  Completion of Attachment (D) is recommended but optional, and may be submitted with required deliverables.

An examination that demonstrates mastery of the peer support competencies and skills must be administered by the contractor in two segments.  A performance based segment that demonstrates mastery of the competencies and skills learned in the face-to-face training (those marked below with an asterisk under "Task One") will be administered during the face-to-face training.  A second segment of the examination will be administered to measure the competencies and skills that do not require a face-to-face experiential modality after completion of the training or at a later time agreed upon and acceptable to VHA for administration at the student participant's home facility.. Peer support staff must pass the examination with a score determined by and agreeable to the vendor and OMHS.


5.	Specific Tasks and Deliverables.  If for any reason, any deliverable cannot be delivered on time according to the below schedule, the contractor shall provide a written explanation three days prior to the due date to the Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR).  This written transmittal shall include a firm commitment of when the work shall be completed.  This transmittal to the COTR shall cite reasons for the delay, and the impact on the overall project.  The COTR will review collaboratively with the program office and facts and issue a response in accordance with the contract terms and conditions.  Unless otherwise specified an electronic copy shall be placed in the designated CBO SharePoint site or other CBO-designated site.  Specifically, the contractor shall:
5.1	Task One.  The contractor shall develop a plan for training to thoroughly cover the following 34 competencies.  Competencies that must have an experiential performance based modality of training that includes role-playing or other demonstration of skills, observed and critiqued by the trainer, are marked with an asterisk in the list below.  The contractor may include other topics/competencies in the training which they deem appropriate or are required by their state's peer support certification training approval process.

<DESC>Description<br /><br />1. This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for information purposes only and neither constitutes a solicitation nor a commitment by the government to award a contract now or in the future. Submitting information for this RFI is voluntary, and participants will not be compensated. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.
<p><br />2. The ASC's Special Operations Forces and Personnel Recovery Division of the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Directorate is soliciting information to identify possible non-developmental sources for configuration upgrades and engineering support for the Mission Training Device (MTD) currently in use at Cannon Air Force Base for the AC-130W program. The MTD will emulate the Mission Operator Pallet (MOP) and as such, will be used for aircrew training on the AC-130J mission equipment consisting of the medium caliber gun with trainable gun mount, multiple Standoff-Off Precision Guided Munitions (SOPGMs), internal crew member and external communications, Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) data links, Line of Sight (LOS) data links, multiple Electrical Optical /Infrared (EO/IR) sensors, as well as various carry-on systems. With the exception of the gun and the EO/IR sensors the MOP powers all of the mission equipment both on and off the pallet. The MOP MTD hosts the battle management system software and the fire control system software and, through operator controls, controls the employment of SOPGMs and firing of the gun.</p>
<p>3. Upgrades shall include:</p>
<p>a. Vital X - Software and Training<br />b. DI-GUY - Scenario generator that enables simulation alterations to meet users need<br />c.

ASQ-236 - Simulated synthetic aperture radar to provide detailed maps for intelligence and surveillance assessment training needs <br />e. SOPGM Fly-Out - Upgraded simulation to provide malfunctions/misses/faults to provide realistic mission training environment <br />f. 30mm Fly-out capabilities - currently no 30mm capabilities<br />g. Maintenance data and Training Source Data</p>
<p>4. Responses to this RFI should assume no data will be furnished for the MOP structure and MOP hardware/software architecture supporting the MTD due to proprietary restrictions. Responses should define how said data will be obtained. Responses should further assume that limited United States Government data will be provided for the AC-130J MTD upgrade. Additionally, responses should assume a requirement for one year Interim Contractor Support (ICS) for initial maintenance and training of the current support contractor for the MTD. This shall include software/hardware sustainment, future growth capabilities and daily operational requirements. Responses should identify how the requested upgrades would be incorporated into the existing systems while retaining current capabilities.<br /><br />In particular, the government is interested in the following information:</p>
<p>a. Proposed configuration status accounting of the MTD system, and subsystems.</p>
<p>b. Indicate engineering and technical services for upgrades and impacted MTD system and subsystems.</p>
<p>c. Indicate all parts and equipment necessary for the MTD system and subsystems sufficient to maintain training requirements.</p>
<p>d. Identify a sustainable Supply Chain to include Packaging, Handling, Storage, and Transportation (PHS&amp;T) to and from OEM/ Source of Repair/Supplies to repair the MTD.</p>
<p>e. Approach for a symbiotic relationship with the current Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) provider to ensure all AFSOC training requirements are included.</p>

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.
<p>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), is seeking information on a potential requirement for "Ambulance Patient Compartment Testing."</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the <strong>NAICS code 541380</strong> for the potential acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Draft Brief of Statement of Work (SOW).</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> The Contractor shall be responsible for conducting four (4) dynamic tests and one static test. The four dynamic tests will include three full vehicle crash tests and one partial vehicle sled/cart test. The goal of this testing is to determine the loading experienced by the patient compartment in two unique crash scenarios; vehicle shear and rollover. The first sled/cot scenario we are attempting to emulate would result in the front face of the modular or "box-like" patient compartment being the point of impact in an offset frontal impact. In most cases, the modular body or patient compartment of a Type I or III ambulance is wider than the driving cab. This presents an exposed surface not otherwise protected by the energy mitigation system found in the front of the original equipment manufacturer's (OEM) cab. Real world impact events such as this have been noted to completely shear off or remove the impacted side of some modular ambulances.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Project Objectives </strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>This contractor shall quantify the dynamic loading experienced by the patient compartment of a commercial ambulance through the use of four different testing methods. These test methods are draft documents proposed by an industry-government team of experts and borrow heavily from testing of civilian and commercial vehicles. As a part of this process, the testing methods themselves shall be evaluated and validated. At the completion of this testing program the Contractor will have created a dataset which will:</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>1. Qualify the logic and language described in each of the four proposed test methods. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>2. Provide the data necessary for AMD and its partners to approve one to four of the proposed test methods as a new standard or standards to validate improvements in the structural integrity of patient compartment of the ambulance. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>3. If funded as options to the effort, the pulse shapes described in SAE J2917 and SAE J2956 will be validated for use in the design of interiors for Type II (raised roof vans and Sprinters).</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>The Contractor will be expected to work to a fairly aggressive schedule as this data will be evaluated for possible inclusion in the second edition of the new National Fire Protection Association's NFPA 1917 Automotive Ambulance Standard. This is the first national consensus standard which has gained the support of most factions associated with the industry: manufacturers, end users, suppliers, and government purchasers. The first edition is expected to be published in June 2012. A comment period of 12 months will follow leading to the development of the 2nd edition. Given the goal of this research is to influence the 2nd Edition; we anticipate a need to be finished prior to June 2013.</em></p>
<p><strong>Anticipated period of performance. Approximately nine (9) months.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Other important considerations. </strong></p>
<p>ISO Certifications to conduct this form of testing.</p>

<p><strong>Sources Sought for Commercial Item Purchase</strong></p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on vendors that are capable of providing a cryostat with the following technical specifications:</p>
<p>The supply to be acquired is a cryostat. A cryostat is a scientific instrument providing a very low pressure (vacuum) low temperature (~ 4 Kelvin) environment. The cryostat is specified in terms of its cooling power (1 Watt). The cryostat thus provides a cold space to undertake scientific experiments.

<DESC><p>Introduction</p>
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses, HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your response to this information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under NAICS code 541711 should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), is seeking a small business with the ability to serve as a Metabolomics Standards Synthesis Facility (SF) for the production of candidate metabolomic standards, isotopically-labeled and unlabeled, from key mammalian metabolic pathways including but not limited to such pathways as the glycolytic pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle pathway, sterol, lipid and aminoacid metabolism pathways. The Metabolomics Standard Synthesis Facility is a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Common Fund, Metabolomics Program. All Common Fund initiatives invite investigators to develop bold, innovative, and often risky approaches to address problems that may seem intractable or to seize new opportunities that offer the potential for rapid progress.</p>
<p>Metabolomics is the study of low molecular weight molecules or metabolites found within cells and biological systems. It involves technologies, such as mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy which can measure hundreds to thousands of unique chemical entities. The metabolome is a measure of the output of biological pathways and is the most integrated measure of a cell's functional state and thus presents a powerful platform for discerning mechanistic information on different normal and disease states. <br /><br />Despite early promise, challenges remain before the full potential of metabolomics can be realized for translational research. One of the challenges identified was the lack of authentic standards to help in identification, coverage as well as quantitative and qualitative validation of metabolomic findings. The Metabolomics Standards Synthesis Facility (SF) will support the activities of the NIH Common Fund Metabolomics Program and provide services as a US FDA-defined current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) production facility for candidate metabolomic standards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />Project Requirements</p>
<p>The Metabolomics SF shall: 1) participate in the Steering Committee (SC), and subcommittees as necessary, and attend SC meetings and participate in teleconferences, 2) provide, maintain and update a Manual of Procedures (MOP), 3) participate as a member of the Metabolomics Program committees and subcommittees, 4) attend the annual Common Fund Metabolomics Program meetings and participate in monthly teleconferences with the Common Fund Metabolomics Data Repository and Coordinating Center, 5) Develop Material Transfer Agreements (MTA) in collaboration with the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and other components of the Program, for use between the SF and the research investigators' institutions that are part of the Metabolomics Program, 6) Provide services as a US FDA-defined current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) production facility for candidate metabolomic standards. 7) Synthesize to &ge; 95% purity, process, analyze store, and ship products synthesized, 8) Evaluate and report to the COR the feasibility of, and approximate time required to fulfill, each request for synthesis received from the COR, 9) collaborate with the COR and Metabolomics Program to contribute synthesized product data to its electronic databases and web sites. Submit data as defined and called for in the MOP, 10) implement and maintain quality control and quality assurance plans to ensure at least 95% or greater purity for all candidate metabolomic standards requested, 11) have the ability to perform analysis of chemical purity and propose a plan to monitor stability of the standards detailing a recommended method and frequency of analysis, 12) develop analytical protocols to ensure metabolomic standards of uniformly high quality are shipped as requested by the COR, 13) ensure that sufficient quantities of all metabolomic standards synthesized are available to meet the needs of the Metabolomics Program, 14) design and implement monitoring plans for standards including production and compliance with regulatory requirements, 15) maintain and make available for review, as necessary, records of monitoring activities, 16) develop a tracking tool accessible to the COR of all requests and corresponding estimated costs for synthesis and distribution received, 17) participate in site visits to the synthesis facility be conducted by the Metabolomics Program, 18) maintain a laboratory that meets all requirements for the production of research grade and clinical grade reagents, 19) comply with all relevant Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) and Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW) regulations, 20) provide complete protocol information, including quality control and quality assurance procedures, in accordance with the MOP to the COR for each synthesized product, 21) establish and implement a plan to work with institutional technical transfer offices to facilitate the completion of material transfer agreements and contracts required to ship materials from one institution to another, and 22) provide the Metabolomics Program with updates to metabolomics standard molecules SF portion of the MOP.</p>

<p>***NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division - Boulder, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Yankee Environmental Systems, Inc. of Turner Falls, MA for two Multifilter Rotating Shadowband Radiometer (MFR-7) instruments.</p>
<p>***The sole source determination is based on the National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) market research and expert knowledge in determining that Yankee Environmental Systems, Inc. is a unique source to fulfill this need based on the company's uniquely proven product, existing operational deployment in climate research networks, and positive past performance. Additional MFR-7s are required to complete NOAA's network of instrumentation that is also a collaboration of the Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement network that is directly scientifically intercomparable with other research entities using the same or similar instrumentation. The multifilter rotating shadowband radiometer (MFRSR) takes spectral measurements of direct normal, diffuse horizontal and total horizontal solar irradiances. These measurements are at nominal wavelengths of 415, 500, 615, 673, 870, and 940 nm. The measurements are made at a user-specified time interval, usually about one minute or less. The sampling rate for the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Climate Research Facility MFRSRs is 20 seconds. From such measurements, one may infer the atmosphere's optical depth at the wavelengths mentioned above. In turn, these optical depths may be used to derive information about the column abundances of ozone and water vapor (Michalsky et al. 1995), as well as aerosol (Michalsky et al. 1994) and other atmospheric constituents. Required Delivery is April 16, 2012.</p>
<p>***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can fully meet the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

<DESC><p>The General Services Administration, Heating Operations and Transmission Division (HOTD), has the following requirement for VFD's Chilled Water Pumps &amp; Tower Fan Project.<br /><br />Location(s): GSA/HOTD<br />13th &amp; C Streets, SW<br />Washington, DC 20407</p>
<p><strong>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT. THIS IS "SOURCES SOUGHT" REQUEST. ANY RESPONSE TO THIS RFI / SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE WILL BE USED BY THE GOVERNMENT AS MARKET RESEARCH, FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES AND TO MAKE APPROPRIATE ACQUISITIONS DECISIONS.</strong></p>
<p>The General Services Administration located in Washington DC, is looking for qualified vendors capable of performing the work as listed below. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND</span></strong> <br />The GSA HOTD currently supplies steam to over 100 federal buildings in the District of Columbia and chilled water service to buildings in three agencies, the Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Agriculture (DOA), and Smithsonian Institute (SI). These services are a critical part of the customers' daily operation. In order to guarantee that these customers receive steam and chilled water services without interruption, HOTD must continually maintain the plant's critical equipment.<br /><br />HOTD operates the refrigeration plant 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. There are four (4) cooling tower cells on each side of the plant. Cooling tower cell #8, on the South side of the plant, already has a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD). The air flow to cell #8 is restricted due to its location. HOTD intends to relocate the existing VFD from cell #8 to cell #7. HOTD is also proposing the installation of a new VFD for cell # 2. This would mirror South side functionality on the North side giving greater flexibility in operations resulting in overall system efficiency gains.<br /><br />HOTD has six (6) chilled water recirculation pumps. None of these pumps currently employ the use of a VFD system for capacity control. Chilled water demand is constantly varying depending on the weather, building occupancy, and other factors. To meet this changing demand the Central Heating &amp; Refrigeration Plant is in need of the installation for three (3) variable frequency drives (VFD's) on one (1) cooling tower fan motor and two (2) chiller water circulation pump motors to keep the AC electric motors operating at maximum efficiency and lessen operational difficulties of flow control.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DESCRIPTION OF WORK<br /></span></strong>Contractor shall be responsible for all design modification (the majority of the design has already been accomplished), commissioning, testing, training, developing standards of operation manuals, supervision, labor, parts and material to install the VFDs, associated equipment, and controls. Presently, the refrigeration plant uses a combination of York and Allen Bradley controls. The SCADA system was supplied, installed, and is maintained by the Feed Forward Company. New controls must be integrated into the existing SCADA system. New controls shall be the same make and model as the existing, equivalent, or better. HOTD requires that Feed Forward integrate the new controls into the existing SCADA system and make other required changes in graphics, data collection, etc. <br /><br />Contractor shall install a new VFD for the motor that powers cooling tower fan #2, and relocate the existing VFD and controls for cooling tower fan #8 to fan #7. Contractor shall install a new VFD and controls for chilled water circulation pump motors #1 and #5. Each new VFD shall have bypass mode. The intent of this contract is to install new equipment manufactured by the same vendor as the VFD system on cooling tower #8 in order to standardize maintenance and operation. However, the new equipment shall be as specified in the above design contract, most recent model, equivalent, or better. The system components, installed under this contract shall be UL, NFPA, and NEC approved and labeled. The proposed system shall be from a reputable contractor who has been in such business for a minimum of 10 years. Contractor shall also be responsible for developing operation, commissioning, and training manuals. Contractor shall be responsible for commissioning the new system. The new systems shall not interfere with plant operation during installation, commissioning, and training. Actual installation shall be accomplished during seasonal shutdown of various plant equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated Term of Services:</strong> Services are to be provided for a period of 280 days.</p>
<p><strong>NAICS Code: 238220</strong></p>
<p><strong>Estimated Construction Price Range:</strong> Between 500,000.00 and 2,500,000.00.</p>
<p><strong>THIS SOURCES SOUGHT, SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A FORMAL SOLICITATION. INFORMATION IS TO BE PROVIDED ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS. THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT OR INDIRECT COSTS INCURRED BY THE VENDOR IN PREPARING OR SUBMITTING THIS VOLUNTARY INFORMATION. <br /><br /></strong>Contractors who feel they can provide the GSA Heating Operation &amp; Transmission District's Central Heating and Refrigeration Plant with the above services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response which includes the following information:<br /><br />1) What is the name of your business?<br /><br />2) What is your POC's name, telephone number, e-mail address, and business address?<br /><br />3) Is your firm a large business, small business, a certified 8(a) small business, certified HUBZone business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Veteran, Woman, and/or Minority Owned Business and/or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business concern according to NAICS 238220?<br /><br />4) Is your business eligible to perform the tasks as described in this document? <br /><br />_______ I AM interested in this procurement and would like to receive a solicitation if and when it issued.</p>
<p>_______ I AM NOT interested in this procurement and would not like to receive a copy of the solicitation.</p>
<p>All responsible sources are encouraged to respond to this sources sought announcement by submitting a capability statement response to the questions contained within this notice via email to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shannon.perkins@gsa.gov</span></strong> and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">mark.trussell@gsa.gov</span></strong> no later than March 23rd, 2012 by 2PM - EST. The Government does not intend to rank submittals or provide any reply to interested firms. Any Questions please contact Shannon Perkins and Mark Trussell by email.

The project is planned to be issued on or about 15 April 2012.  <br><br>The Army Corps of Engineers monitors recreational and drinking water quality routinely to ensure public health and safety and to meet state compliance requirements. Army Corps facilities and recreation areas are widely scattered in New England and the sample area served by this scope of work includes southern Vermont but is primarily concerned with southwest New Hampshire locations.  Analysis and data reporting of surface and potable waters are required and the contractor must be certified in both states.  Sample holding times, state analytical methods and reporting requirements must be met. <br><br>Time constraints associated with sample collection tasks, logistics, and sample incubation time necessitate that the laboratory do all microbiological analysis in-house and that they be located in such a location that the workload can be routinely accomplished and samples can be delivered by 1:00pm.  The locations of the Corps projects means that the Corps technician can collect all beach samples and finish at 12:45pm at either Surry Mountain Lake near Keene, NH or Edward MacDowell Lake near Peterborough, NH, and the lab must be within 15 minutes of one of those locations.<br><br>Surface water samples (typically 12 or 13, from beaches at 4 or 5 locations) require analysis for Escherichia.  All colony count results must be reported by phone to the Army Corps no later than 3:00 the following afternoon, with a hard copy of the data following by mail.  <br><br>Potable water samples routinely require analysis for Total Coliform, and occasionally Nitrate, and /or  Nitrite is required.  Other infrequently requested analytes may include Arsenic, Iron, sodium, hardness and alkalinity. Again, microbiology colony counts must be reported by phone to the Army Corps no later than 3:00pm the following afternoon. Reporting in accordance with state compliance requirements is required.  Electronic data reporting to the state of New Hampshire and Vermont, for all compliance samples, is required. <br><br>Interested firms should submit a capabilities package to include the following:  business classification (i.e. HUBZone, Small Business, 8(a) etc.) as well as qualifications of the team and experience in performing the work requirements stated above.  Interested firms shall provide the following:<br><br> 	Location:  proximity to the work area  (see attached map for primary locations and travelled routes) <br> 	Past demonstrated experience with two examples of a project, similar in scope, size, complexity, and magnitude to this project that the interested firm has performed.  The examples must demonstrate beyond typical data reporting turn-around times as receipt of all colony counts by 3:00 is critical to the success of the District's mission.<br> 	The past experience examples must have been performed within the last five years.<br> 	Interested firms must state or describe the partnership arrangement of the teaming members, and what portions of the work will be performed by each team member, should the capabilities package includes examples from multiple team members.<br> 	Accreditations listing. <br> 	Analytical methods and detection limits for Total and Escherichia Coliform as well as Nitrate and Nitrate. <br><br>Responses are due 23 March 2012. Responses should be addressed to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, 696 Virginia Road, Concord, MA 01742-2751, ATTN:  Ms. Lauren Devin.  Responses are limited to twenty pages.

<DESC>This is an advance notice of a Draft Request for Proposals.  This notice will be revised in the coming weeks with additional information, and interested firms are advised to check frequently for updates.<br><br>Description<br><br>The iCREW system is a new urgent one-time requirement for Central Command (CENTCOM) and the Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) Area of Responsibility (AOR). Use of the iCREW system may be extended to other AORs based on operational need. This particular system is intended to be worn by an individual soldier, and provide a small zone of protection to only that individual soldier, in a dismounted mode of operation. iCREW systems must meet the minimum environmental conditions contained in Army Regulation 70-38, Research, Development, Test and Evaluation of Materiel for Extreme Climatic Conditions for Operation in hot-dry (A-1) and cold (C-2). The Government anticipates that the iCREW system will be non-developmental and production-ready.<br><br>Requirements<br><br>Up to 3900 iCREW Systems with associated training, technical manuals and initial sparing.  Additional requirements may include but not be limited to: Production Plan, Integrated Master schedule, various Test Reports, Quality Management Plan, Configuration Management Plan,  Anti-Tamper Plan, Technical Data Package, Software Data, Unique item Identification, and Packaging.  It is expected that a First Article Test would commence approximately 90 days after contract award with initial production deliveries commencing approximately 150 days from award.  All of the iCREW systems procured must be delivered to the CENTCOM AOR no later than May 2013.  At this point in time, the need for Contractor Logistical Support (CLS), such as, Field Support Representatives (FSRs), maintainers, and depot, is under discussion, because the system may be determined to be a throwaway item, they will not be added to the Army inventory, and there is no follow-on effort currently anticipated.<br><br>Performance Based Specifications<br><br>An attachment to this notice provides the unclassified Performance Based Specification that the delivered iCREW systems must meet.   The threshold performance specifications, both classified and unclassified, define minimum government requirements that must be met.  The objective specifications define the desired requirements. <br><br>Instructions on how to obtain the full, classified Performance Based Specification will be provided at a later date.<br><br>Samples<br><br>As part of the source selection process, offerors will be required to submit three or four systems to allow for the Government's evaluation against the performance specifications provided.  Evaluation will occur in the laboratories at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, MD and at a Government test range.  Offerors will have the opportunity to ensure that the systems are operating correctly prior to the commencement of the evaluation but the actual testing/evaluation will be conducted by the Government.  Individual test results will be provided at the completion of the source selection as part of the unsuccessful offeror de-briefing process.<br><br>Planned Industry Day<br><br>An Industry Day (tentatively scheduled for 28-30 March 2012 at Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD) will be held to inform industry on the current stages and requirements, based on the Request for Proposal (RFP), for the iCREW program. Solicitation of feedback from industry is encouraged to assist the Government in the finalization of the RFP documents and provide clarification to requirements. Prospective offerors are encouraged to bring at least one representative production ready system to this Industry Day to provide the Government an opportunity to view production ready iCREW systems.  Additional information about Industry Day, to include registration instructions, will be available on or about March 12, 2012 at http://www.icrewindustryday.com/.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE AN AWARD.  Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC)- Installation Contracting Office (ICO) Fort Sill, Oklahoma intends to award a SOLE SOURCE Contract to Black Swamp Bird Observatory for Fort Sill, Oklahoma in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The period of performance for this requirement is a base year 1 April 2012 through 31 March 2013 and two following option years, 1 April 2013 through 31 March 2015.   The award shall consist of the following: Black-Capped Vireo Study (BCVS) in the Fort Sill area which requires a significant area of surveying within a very specific time frame to begin 1 April 2012 due to migratory patterns.  Contractor shall provide all labor, supplies and equipment to accomplish the following work; The work requires that access to federal lands for surveys be acquired, federal and state endangered species/recovery permits to be current, and have trained and permitted staff that are available to meet project requirements. The incumbent is the only known source that can meet Agency requirements at this time. The BCVS project requires the expertise of trained and permitted Black-Capped Vireo surveyors to begin survey by 1 April 2012. The selected contractor has staff members that are already trained and permitted to survey for the Black-Capped Vireo and currently have agreements in place to access all required areas for surveys. Based on market research conducted, it would take a substantial amount of preparation time for another company to offer similar services that would meet these requirements. The time sensitivity of the project makes it particularly unlikely that another company would be able to obtain the required federal authorization and access to field sites in time to begin surveys by 1 April 2012. This requirement shall be awarded as a firm fixed price contract. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 813312, size standard $14 million.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all proposals received within fifteen (15) calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  For more information please send email to:  Eric Romero, Contract Specialist eric.romero5.civ@mail.mil  and William E. Boyer, Contracting Officer at william.e.boyer@us.army.mil.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a modification on a sole source basis to Precision Machine & Supply, Inc., 3218 East Main Street, Lewiston ID 83501.  The justification is Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.   Hoover Dam began modernizing Pressure Relief Valves (PRVs) in 2007.  The PRVs were designed and built by different contractors.  As such, the PRVs are not standardized.  Hoover Dam overhauled A2, A4, and A7 PRVs without modernization prior to 2007.  Hoover Dam overhauled and modernized N2, N3, N4, N7 and A6 PRVs since 2007.  Hoover Dam will overhaul and modernize N1, N6, N8, A1, A3, A5, A8, and A9.  Hoover Dam is also planning to modernize A2, A4, and A7.  Modernized PRVs operate with a hydraulic system controlled by a programmable logic controller (PLC).  The PLC monitors the status of the generator through the Unit Control Modernization (UCM).  The hydraulic fluid is routed by way of a distributing valve that is controlled by the PLC.  The modernization of Hoover Dam's PRVs requires the digital controls and hydraulic fluid valves be standardized.
This procurement is to purchase three additional Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) control systems and three additional Hydraulic Control Manifolds that are identical in design, manufacture, assembly, and function to those already provided for under Contract No. R06PC30062.  Under Contract No. R06PC30062, PLC control systems and hydraulic control manifolds were specially designed, manufactured, and supplied to modernize pressure regulating valves (PRVs) at Hoover Dam.  The modernization required the following:  (1) changing the control of the PRV from mechanical to digital; (2) replacing the components operated by lake water and the mechanical linkages to the turbine with oil-hydraulic systems and digital hydraulic drivers; and (3) linking computer intelligence electronically from the UCM PLCs to the PRV's controls to operate the modernized PRV.  In order to achieve the modernization, Precision Machine was required, in part, to perform the following work:  (1) design, build, and install a PLC control system to operate the PRV that communicates with the Unit Control Modernization (UCM) control system and (2) design, manufacture, and install a control manifold to properly distribute the oil for moving the cylinder.  In response to Precision Machine's requirements, Controlled Motion Solutions (Comoso) and American Governor provided designs and schematics.  Precision Machine required that the Comoso's hydraulic manifold correctly control the flow of high pressure hydraulic oil into and out of the hydraulic cylinder in response to commands received from the American Governor controller.  Precision Machine and its subcontractors have exclusivity agreements to the design and systems and they are proprietary.  Three additional quantities of the PLC control systems and Hydraulic Control Manifolds must be supplied in order for Hoover Dam to modernize PRV Units A2, A4, and A7.    
This notice of intent is not to be considered a request for quotations or competitive proposals, however, all capability statements received within 7 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.    
All responses to this special notice shall be provided to Rita Horkan, LC-10212, Bureau of Reclamation, P.O. Box 61470, Boulder City, NV 89006-1470, via e-mail to rhorkan@usbr.gov, or via facsimile (702) 293-8036.  
The Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition will be made available for public inspection as required by 41 U.S.C. 253(f)(4).

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Analytical Chemistry Division, Material Measurement Laboratory, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), with Bruker Biospin, Inc., for the purchase of Annual Maintenance and Repair Service for two Bruker Biospin (Models AVII 700 MHz &amp; AVII 800 MHz) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer located at Hollings Marine Lab, Charleston, SC. NIST intends to purchase one base year maintenance and emergency repair service, and two option year maintenance and emergency repair services.<br />
<p><br />Sole Source determination is based on the following: Bruker Biospion is the only company capable of providing the annual maintenance and repair service of two (2) NIST-owned Bruker Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometers. Most electronic components in these instrument are custom designed and manufactured parts (proprietary). Specifically, the internal workings and unique details of the systems are proprietary to Bruker. Due to the proprietary nature of these systems, Bruker Biospin is the only vendor able to provide the required maintenance and repair of these systems. Bruker Biospin does not license other vendors to utilize their proprietary technology. As a result, Bruker Biospin is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's minimum requirement for maintenance and repair service.</p>
<p>Bruker Biospin, Inc., is the only vendor capable of providing the required annual maintenance and emergency services on two NIST-owned Bruker Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometers in order to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements. Bruker Biospin is the sole manufacturer and distributor.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 811219, and the size standard is $19 million.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by March 23, 2012, 3:30 p.m. EST.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE:  Applicable to NUWCDIVNPT contractors who have Clause C16 or C16S Cost and Performance Reporting in their contracts/SeaPort-e Task Orders

The Electronic Cost Reporting and Financial Tracking (eCRAFT) System Periodic Report Utility (EPRU) spreadsheet and users manual have been changed.

Effective Date:  12 March 2012

Some of the old fields have been renamed.

New fields have been added to the spreadsheet as follows.   
- Identify Subcontractors by cage code:  This is done via lookup in EPRU.  This is a required field.
- SLIN Level:  You must now report at the SLIN level (old field name was SL).  This is a required field.
- Calculation of fee as a percentage of cost.  Use this only completed when the contract requires it.
 The fee per hour calculation is still available and should be used as required.

All required fields are in red.

You must go to the NUWCDIVNPT Contracts website to get the new Manual and spreadsheet.
The site address is:  http://www.navsea.navy.mil/nuwc/newport/contracts/default.aspx

If you submit a report into the EPRU using the old spreadsheet, you will get a rejection notice and will have to resubmit using the new spreadsheet.

If you have any questions about the revisions to EPRU, please first check the eCRAFT Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) for an answer.  If you do not find your answer, please send your question to:
nuwc_npt_59_policy@navy.mil

Please continue to monitor the NUWC Contracts website for additional updates to EPRU.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 6.302-1: Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with IHS Global Inc., Engelwood, CO, for a one year subscription to the 2012 Chemical Economics Handbook (CEH).
<p>Multiple EPA divisions use CEH data in a variety of regulatory support efforts, such as industry profiles for economic analyses and in industry characterizations for MACT, NSPS, and other standards.

<p>No solicitation or Request for Quote is available. All responsible sources that believe they are capable of meeting EPA's requirement as described herein may submit a capability statement not later than 23 March 2012, noon, EST to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, RTP-POD, 109 T.W. Alexander Dr., Attn: Andrew Flynn, E105-02, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.

Responses may also be emailed to Andrew Flynn at flynn.andrew@epa.gov. All timely responses will be considered. Responses must be in writing and provide clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Office of Procurement Operations (OPO) intends to&nbsp;award a Purchase Order&nbsp;using other than full and open competition procedures&nbsp;for annual software maintenance and support services&nbsp;for the PortalGuard for Domino&nbsp;software, which is&nbsp;developed by PistolStar, Incorporated.&nbsp;The DHS, Office of the Chief Financial Officer has 3,500 PortalGuard DHS license seats that currently require annual maintenance and support.&nbsp;Accordingly,&nbsp;OPO intends to award a&nbsp;Purchase Order&nbsp;to PistolStar, Incorporated, 800 Poor Farm Rd, Francestown,&nbsp;NH 03043. The statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) per FAR 6.302-1(a)(2). This&nbsp;requirement&nbsp;is&nbsp;estimated to&nbsp;be&nbsp;required for a&nbsp;period&nbsp;beyond one year and therefore the period of performance will be a total of&nbsp;five years; one twelve-month base period with&nbsp;four twelve-month option periods.&nbsp; The support and maintenance of the resultant Purchase Order will include the following: Technical and troubleshooting support for all end users; technical fixes of all software flaws; and the provision of all enhancements made by the developer to the software.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p><br />The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302 and FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all quotes received&nbsp;by the response date of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. The Government will notify parties of the outcome of any proposal submitted in response. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>The purchase will be awarded without further notice on approximately&nbsp;March 16, 2012.</p>

<DESC>This notice is to inform all interested parties that Solicitation VA-248-11-RP-0356 is being canceled due to lack of funding IAW FAR 15.206(e), FAR 32.702, & 31 U.S.C. 1341 (Anti-Deficiency Act)

All proposed prices substantially exceeded both the agency's cost estimate for the work and the funding available for the project.

Attempts have been made to obtain additional funding, and it has been determined that there is no additional funding available for this project.

The VA Finds that it is not feasible to delete any requirements from the exsisting to allow for award of a contract with a smaller scope of work, since it previously has already deleted certain work requirements from the RFP in an effort to reduce offerors' proposed prices in the hope of allowing an award within the set budget.

<DESC>Pursuant to the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007; Subtitle E; Section 655, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, on behalf of the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy's Building Technologies Program, intends to accept entrants to the Bright Tomorrow Lighting Competition (L PrizeTM). As outlined in the EISA, the DOE is accepting entries of Solid-State Lighting (SSL) products for full performance evaluation which have the technical potential to qualify for the PAR 38 halogen replacement lamp category. <br /><br />The L Prize Competition is intended to encourage development and deployment of highly energy efficient SSL products to replace common lighting products currently used in the United States, including PAR 38 halogen lamps. To significantly impact the national market and lighting use, the SSL products must perform similarly to the lamps they are intended to replace in terms of color appearance, light output, light distribution, and lamp shape, size, form factor, appearance and operating environment. They must be reliable, available through normal market channels, and competitively priced. Entries will be evaluated against performance criteria based upon the statutory requirements of the EISA. Full competition requirements can be found at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.lightingprize.org</span>. <br /><br />EISA provides for a cash prize of up to US$5 million for the first PAR 38 replacement lamp product that meets all specified requirements of the L Prize competition. In addition to cash prizes, the L Prize authorization provides that the Secretary of Energy is to consult with the Administrator of General Services to develop federal purchase guidelines with the goal of replacing PAR 38 halogen lamps in federal facilities with L Prize winning SSL products. Up to two additional products may be recognized if they meet all requirements of the L Prize PAR 38 competition. These products would not receive a cash prize, but would be eligible for DOE recognition, federal procurement, and promotion by L Prize partner energy efficiency programs. Entrants must submit 1,000 commercially acceptable quality control units which meet the full competition requirements specified at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.lightingprize.org</span>.

<a href="mailto:gloria.bailey1@us.army.mil">PEO STRI Acquisition Center</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) is contemplating a new multiple award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Contract for a wide range of training tasks and services to support the Warfighter Outside the Contiguous United States (OCONUS) and Continental United States (CONUS) locations.  The proposed program is Train, Educate, and CoacH (TEACH).  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Class Code is 611430 Professional and Management Development Training. The size standard is $7 million average annual receipts.<br><br>PROGRAM BACKGROUND: <br><br>OCONUS and CONUS units rely on contracted support to train and instruct U.S. military combat troops, foreign national forces (e.g. SW Asia, etc.) and coalition forces in a variety of missions from the very fundamental tenets (literacy instruction) to war fighting skills.  These demands and requests to PEO STRI for this instructional training across a varied customer base have driven the PEO to contemplate award of a multiple award contract dedicated to satisfying these customer/Warfighter services.  The addition of PEO STRI's new training services contract will give the Army and our other Support Mission Customers a broader performance based service scope and increased efficiencies through competition.<br><br>PROPOSED ACQUISITION STRATEGY:<br><br>The Government anticipates awarding a small group (< 10) ID/IQ contractors that will be the offerors who demonstrate the ability to cover the depth and breadth of training and training related services as delineated in the Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) provided with this announcement.  The ID/IQ contract awards will be made to the selected offerors, who offer the best value to the Government. The Warfighter FOCUS (WFF) single award ID/IQ contract remains PEO STRI's primary vehicle to provide Life Cycle Contractor Support (LCCS) for Training Aids, Devices, Simulators and Simulations (TADSS) sustainment. <br><br>The Government desires the best performance based solution sets available to provide the training and training related services to the Warfighter.  The Government will not articulate how the Offeror should conduct or establish business arrangements to fulfill the TEACH requirements.  Offerors will be evaluated on their capability to satisfy the full spectrum of requirements for TEACH for the initial IDIQ award.  The TO evaluations will include the offerors ability to satisfy the specific requirements stated in the TO PWS. <br><br>The Government has not finalized the small business strategy for TEACH.  However, in accordance with FAR 19.7, The Small Business Subcontracting Program, large business will be required to submit small business subcontracting plan as part of their offer and in addition, the Government anticipates requiring an aggressive small business participation plan from all offerors.<br><br>The Government shall award Task orders (TO) under the ID/IQ contract in accordance with FAR 16.505 - Ordering.  TOs awarded may use any of the following contract types:  Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Fixed Price Incentive (FPI), Cost plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), Cost, Cost plus Award Fee (CPAF), Cost plus Incentive Fee (CPIF), and a minimal amount of Time and Material (T&M).  The Government envisions that the majority of the TOs will be FFP.  To be eligible for award of a cost type contract, the contractor's accounting system shall be adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract as well as a Government approved purchasing system.  TO awardees must have a security clearance of at least Secret.  In some instances, awarded TOs may require handling of  classified information up to Top Secret.<br><br>The proposed period of performance (PoP) for the ID/IQ contracts is a twelve (12) month base year and nine (9) twelve (12) month option years.  The Government anticipates limiting the TOs to a three (3) year total PoP (base year plus two (2) option years). <br><br>PREVIOUS MARKET RESEARCH:<br><br>The Government posted an initial request for information (RFI) on 25 March 2011 to facilitate development of the TEACH acquisition strategy (AS). <br><br>Along with the RFI, the Government has presented industry with various briefings related to TEACH.  Briefings were provided at the Training and Simulation Industry Symposium (TSIS) held in June 2011 and the Interservice Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference (I/ITSEC) held in December 2011.  The latest briefing slides available are from I/ITSEC and can be located at URL: http://www.peostri.army.mil/PAO/events/IITSEC/2011/FILES/2011-11-30_TSIS-IITSEC_TEACH.pdf.  <br><br>The Government Integrated Project Team (IPT) has conducted continuous one-on-one meetings with industry from April 2011 to present.<br><br>CURRENT REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: <br><br>This announcement includes a draft PWS and a survey which industry may use to provide feedback to the Government on the PWS. Responses for each question within the survey are limited.  The Government requests that each company, business unit or business entity, submit only one consolidated response rather than separate responses from individual persons who wish to provide feedback.  Submissions of the surveys are required no later than Monday, 26 March 2011 at 18:00 EDT.  Please submit your survey via email to Ms. Ann Pham at: ann.pham@us.army.mil.<br><br>All surveys and/or documentation submitted shall become the property of the Government.  The Government reserves the right to utilize and share with industry any information suggested, unless information is identified with proprietary or business sensitive markings and unique to your company. <br><br>In accordance with FAR 52.215-3 - Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes, (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the FAR, (b) Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only.  It shall not be used as a proposal.  The Government may or may not issue a solicitation as a result of this announcement.  There is no solicitation available at this time.<br><br>CONCLUSION:<br><br>It is the Government's desire to continue to interface and communicate with industry throughout the acquisition process until such time that all communication must be directed to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO).  The Government will provide information, draft documentation, and program updates as soon as they are available.  FedBizOpps will be the authoritative source for information related to this program.  Industry is encouraged to register for an account on FedBizOpps and visit this posting on a periodic basis. It is recommended that this posting be added to your "watch list", as defined in the FedBizOpps Vendor Guide, which will place this posting on a quick link on the vendor home page as well as provide notifications when this announcement is amended. <br><br>The Government respectfully requests that information provided or office visits requested by industry be limited to instances that enhance or further the development of TEACH AS and related acquisition products. <br><br>As the program moves forward, the Government anticipates conducting industry conferences to disseminate information and receive feedback.<br><br>Please direct correspondence/questions on this matter to the PCO, Ms. Gloria E. Bailey at 407-380-8508, or email gloria.bailey1@us.army.mil.<br>

<DESC>The United States Army Medical Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, IAW FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) with STEM International, Inc, of 4692 Millennium Dr, Suite 400, Belcamp, MD 21017-1535, as the only responsible source that can provide the specialised items needed to fulfill this requirement. This is a logical follow-on to research and development previously conducted between the Government and STEM International, Inc. This will be firm-fixed-priced contract. <br>The United States Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defence (USAMRICD) requires highly specialised platforms for testing primate intelligence. The exact specifications for the platforms involve the specific animal enclosures currently in use by USAMRICD. These enclosures allow personnel and animals to remain safe because they obviate the need for removal of the animals from the cages for behavioral testing. Under a prior research and development contract, STEM International custom engineered platforms specific for the enclosures and purposes of USAMRICD. <br>A new project has been funded and a requirement for more of the custom platforms has been identified. It is essential that the new platforms be identical to those currently in use for interchangeability, rapid adaptation of the animals' reponses, and to compare scientific results with current and previous studies. <br>A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Based on the above information, the only technically acceptable items are provided by STEM International, Inc. Please submit capability statements (using PDF, MS Word, Excel attachments) to Jackie McGurk at: Jacklyn.McGurk@amedd.army.mil; FAX capability statements may be sent to 410-436-4863 ATTN: Jackie McGurk. Email statements are preferred. Statements are due NLT (no later than) 1300hrs EST (1:00PM EST) on 26 MAR 2012. No telephone calls will be accepted.<br>

<p>3. Basis for Award. 802 CONS will issue a purchase order to the contractor who is determined to offer the Best Value to the Government for the purchase . <br />4. Best Value Evaluation. For this procurement, the Best Value determination will be made based on a Lowest Price Technical Acceptable (LPTA) approach. <br />(a) Technical Acceptability: The Government will first evaluate the Technical Acceptability of all timely quotes. Vendors shall quote on all line items in the Bid Schedule. Any response/quotation that fails to cite a price for each item or fails to make an entry that indicates line item will be provided at no charge will be rejected as Technically Unacceptable. A vendor's quote/response will be determined technically acceptable if it meets the requirements of this paragraph and the following factor is determined Technically Acceptable. Any quote that fails to meet the requirements of this paragraph or is rated technically unacceptable in the factor below will be technically unacceptable overall and will be ineligible for award.<br />(i) Factor 1: Technical Evaluation. In order to be determined Technically Acceptable for this factor, vendors must provide a quote on the brand name specified in the line items or on an equal substitute that meets salient characteristics of the brand name item. Equal item quotes must list the manufacturer and part number and must be accompanied by literature and/or a brochure including photographs and/or drawings. The descriptive literature must demonstrate how the proposed equal meets the salient characteristics of the brand name item listed in CLIN 0001-0018 and failure to include such descriptive literature with the quote will render the quote technically unacceptable. The agency will evaluate the proposed equal product by comparing its salient characteristics listed in the descriptive literature with the salient characteristics of the brand name item. The agency will accept only those proposed equal items whose characteristics match those of the brand name item. <br />(b) Evaluation: Next, the Government will rank the quotes by total evaluated price. Order of ranking will be lowest to highest. Starting with lowest quote, the quotes will be evaluated on Technical Acceptability. If the lowest quote is Technically Acceptable the evaluation ends . If lowest quote is not Technically Acceptable, the next lowest quote will be evaluated. Evaluation ends when the lowest quote that is Technically Accepatble is found. <br />5. Best Value Determination. The lowest priced technically acceptable quote/response will be determined to represent the Best Value. Award will be made to the vendor whose quote is the lowest evaluated price that is technically acceptable.<br />6. Interested parties may submit a written offer in accordance with FAR 52.212-1. Offers submitted orally will not be accepted. Your quote must include discount terms, delivery date, tax identification number, cage code, and DUNS number. To be eligible to receive an award resulting from this RFQ, vendors must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, no exceptions. To register, please apply via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423.

The Government may seek any available remedies in the event the Contractor fails to perform in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract as a result of Government action under this clause.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p><br />52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JUN 2008)</p>
<p>(a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees.</p>
<p>(b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show--</p>
<p>(1) The solicitation number; FA2550-12-R-1001</p>
<p>(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;</p>
<p>(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror;</p>

<p>(6) Price and any discount terms;</p>
<p>(7) "Remit to" address, if different than mailing address;</p>
<p>(8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(b) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically);</p>
<p>(9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments;</p>
<p>(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and</p>
<p>(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.</p>
<p>(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.</p>
<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:</p>
<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p>(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>
<p>(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>
<p>(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>
<p>(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.</p>
<p>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Topical Liquid Skin Adhesive. The Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) West is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the MMESO North, South, West, Pacific, Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) areas of responsibility (AOR) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. This Standardization Action (SA) will apply to all MMESOs. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a technically and clinically preferred product (s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the best possible price. It is intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance requirements as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical preferred threshold, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor (s) for this SA support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The government is seeking a single vendor selection for this SA.</strong></p>
<p>The major facilities in the MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) include but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Medical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK, and Operational U.S. Forces. This SA is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in this SA your company must have or be in the process of obtaining a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Region, i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/</p>
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor(s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to participate in Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is August 2012. </strong>The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. <strong>Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. <br />Points of Contact: Ricardo Orias, MMESO West Team Leader, Ricardo.orias.ctr@med.navy.mil, (619) 532-8537; Cheryl Janus, MMESO West Clinical Analyst, Cheryl.janus.ctr@med.navy.mil, (619) 532-7554.</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Topical Liquid Skin Adhesive. Within the MMESOs this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $3,688,304.00. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Based on usage data, two (2) line items of the total eleven (11) line items represent the top two (2) products and account for 95.6% ($3,525,738) of the total volume in sales ($3,688,304) in the MMESOs and are clinically significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Ricardo Orias, MMESO West Team Leader, ricardo.orias.ctr@med.navy.mil and Ms. Cheryl Janus, Clinical Analyst, cheryl.janus.ctr@med.navy.mil.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO West that their initial submissions, quote and literature arrived at the MMESO West via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor should complete and submit the attached document. A vendor who cannot open the attachments, may contact the POC as noted in the FBO RFIAQ and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors who do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Pacific Standard Time (PST) on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. </strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. <strong>Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs.</strong> The MMESO West reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified and invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection process and will be requested to submit products for testing and their best price discount quotes via an e-mail communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements <br />During the acquisition planning process, the CPT approved the technical/company requirements outlined below. The requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal and required documents by the response date stated in the FBO announcement.<strong> A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I. <br /></strong>1. Vendor must provide a line of Topical Liquid Skin Adhesive products that includes at a minimum the specific products identified below for latex free Topical Liquid Skin Adhesive as follows: <br />a. Topical Liquid Skin Adhesive, Single-Application, Sterile<br />* Operational usage items are included in this list of Topical Liquid Skin Adhesive.<br />b.

Vendor must have an identified customer service representative available for on-site assessment, on-site instructional sessions (in-services), and on-going clinical support as required at no cost to the government for the Topical Liquid Skin Adhesive product line. A vendor must provide a list of customer service representatives with initial submittal. A vendor who cannot provide representatives to support these requirements will be disqualified in Phase I.<br />7. The vendor is required to provide guidance/instructional materials (literature/DVD/pamphlets) to the evaluating MTFs. <br />8. Vendor must provide literature that clearly identifies that the products' packaging are clearly labeled, has manufacturing lot number and expiration date on packaging with initial submittal. A vendor whose products cannot identify these features or a vendor who does not provide documents to support this with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I.<br />9. Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of obtaining a DAPA for the Topical Liquid Skin Adhesive product line. Vendor must provide DAPA number or provide documentation that DAPA has been applied for. <br />10. Vendor must have agreements with the current Med/Surg Prime Vendors for each MMESO AOR, i.e. Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor for Topical Liquid Skin Adhesive or be in the process of obtaining Prime Vendor agreements. <br />11. Vendor will be required to submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative when pricing is requested in Phase III. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. A vendor shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA for in Phase III for all products will be disqualified.<br />12. Vendor must indicate country from which each line item is an end product, IAW Trade Agreements Act. Vendors having existing DAPA numbers must also ensure that all DAPA line items/end products in the subject product line list the proper Trade Agreements Act country in the DAPA Management System.<br />13. Vendor must provide a wound simulation device which is supplied with the Topical Liquid Skin Adhesive samples and will not be returned.</p>
<p>Phase II Clinical Performance Evaluation<br />Following acceptability of the technical/company requirements, the MMESO West on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the specific CPT members at the participating MTFs. <strong>Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the product samples for clinical evaluation in Phase II. Product samples must be shipped no later than fourteen (14) calendar days after issue of notice, and arrive at the designated addresses for each MTF by 5:00PM local time before the 30th calendar day. Vendor must be able to deliver product literature, training materials, a wound simulation device, and evaluation samples as requested to the MMESO Pacific via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) Express Mail ONLY AND throughout the United States by selected shipping method when requested in Phase II. <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vendor must send the MMESO West verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor.</span></em></strong> Vendor will provide only the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. Unused samples will not be returned. One (1) box with a minimum of 6 single-applications of the item listed below and a wound simulation device for evaluation of the samples that will not be returned is to be provided as samples to each of the evaluation sites as identified in the letters of invitation.</p>
<p>Topical Liquid Skin Adhesive, Single-Application, Sterile</p>
<p>Each evaluator will evaluate each product sample from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line. The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1) Completely Unacceptable, two (2) Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3) Partially Unacceptable, four (4) Acceptable, and five (5) Highly Acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon completion of the standardization selection. Of those vendors that are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. Clinical / performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO West and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately twelve (12) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements <br />During the acquisition planning process, the CPT validated/approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below. <br />1. (FDA- Medical Devices, Device Regulation and Guidance. Product Code: OMD - Class II 21 CFR 878.4011). It is easy to identify the type, size, latex content, expiration date and storage requirements of product from the packaging. The product must be labeled in a way that identifies its type, size, latex content, expiration date and storage requirements easily and quickly to reduce the amount of time needed for staff to select the appropriate size and determine if the product is usable.<br />2. (FDA- Medical Devices, Device Regulation and Guidance. Product Code: OMD - Class II 21 CFR 878.4011) The product applicator is easy to open or activate and allows the product to flow well for application to the simulated wound/incision site without dripping.The product applicator must be easy to open/activate and use and the product must flow well out of the applicator for application to the simulated incision site for clinicians to adequately secure the skin together.<br />3. (FDA- Medical Devices, Device Regulation and Guidance. Product Code: OMD - Class II 21 CFR 878.4011; and, product wastage/cost for medical devices) The package is easy to open and allows for aseptic delivery to the simulated sterile field.The package must be designed in a way that allows the clinician to open it and remove the product from the packaging and deliver it to a simulated sterile field without risk of contamination of the product or the sterile field.<br />4. (FDA- Medical Devices, Device Regulation and Guidance. Product Code: OMD - Class II 21 CFR 878.4011; and, product wastage/cost for medical devices). The product dries at the time set by the manufacturer.The product must be dry and protecting the wound in the time prescribed by the vendor. A liquid dressing which is still wet or sticky will not provide wound protection against wound edge separation, risk of microbial invasion or moisture wound damage. <br />5. (FDA- Medical Devices, Device Regulation and Guidance. Product Code: OMD - Class II 21 CFR 878.4011; ASTM F2458-05) The product is strong enough to adhere to the wound simulation device edges without the use of adhesive strips or cover dressings.Clinicians require a product that is strong enough to be able to adhere the tissue on its own without the use of adhesive strips or a cover dressing. Evaluator will&nbsp;use the product to adhere edges together according to the manufacturer's instructions and determine if the edges are adhered well without the need to use adhesive strips or a cover dressing.<br /><br />Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified / invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to MMESO West and must be received by 5:00 PM PST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong></span> The selected Vendor of Choice will have an opportunity to provide other items beyond the minimum required product line that you would like to be considered for addition to the Incentive Agreement with a discount from DAPA. All additions will be at the discretion of the Government.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

The Contractor shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract. The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. If repair/replacement or reperformance will not correct the defects or is not possible, the government may seek an equitable price reduction or adequate consideration for acceptance of nonconforming supplies or services. The Government must exercise its post-acceptance rights --
(1) Within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and
(2) Before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item.
(b) Assignment. The Contractor or its assignee may assign its rights to receive payment due as a result of performance of this contract to a bank, trust company, or other financing institution, including any Federal lending agency in accordance with the Assignment of Claims Act (31 U.S.C.3727). However, when a third party makes payment (e.g., use of the Governmentwide commercial purchase card), the Contractor may not assign its rights to receive payment under this contract.
(c) Changes. Changes in the terms and conditions of this contract may be made only by written agreement of the parties.
(d) Disputes. This contract is subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, as amended (41 U.S.C. 601-613). Failure of the parties to this contract to reach agreement on any request for equitable adjustment, claim, appeal or action arising under or relating to this contract shall be a dispute to be resolved in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.233-1, Disputes, which is incorporated herein by reference. The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any dispute arising under the contract.
(e) Definitions. The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference.
(f) Excusable delays. The Contractor shall be liable for default unless nonperformance is caused by an occurrence beyond the reasonable control of the Contractor and without its fault or negligence such as, acts of God or the public enemy, acts of the Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, unusually severe weather, and delays of common carriers. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing as soon as it is reasonably possible after the commencement of any excusable delay, setting forth the full particulars in connection therewith, shall remedy such occurrence with all reasonable dispatch, and shall promptly give written notice to the Contracting Officer of the cessation of such occurrence.<BR><BR>(g) Invoice.

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 
(2) 
(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to:
(A) Change the name in the CCR database; 
(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;
(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. 
(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor?s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.<BR><BR>Alternate I (Oct 2008) When a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract is contemplated, substitute the following paragraphs (a), (e), (i) and (l) for those in the basic clause.
(a) Inspection/Acceptance. 
(1) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.
(2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties.
(3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier.
(4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the ?hourly rate? for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the ?hourly rate? attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.]<BR><BR>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The solicitation number is 1098224/1098227, and is being issued as a Request for Quotations. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-56, dated March 2, 2012.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System Code is 541711 - Research and Development in Biotechnology with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This acquisition is not set aside for small businesses.</p>
<p>Project Background</p>
<p>Millions of vascular stents are inserted into patients every year and a significant percentage of these are prematurely failing because of material fracture. Also, a number of drug-eluting stents have experienced coating problems such as cracking and peeling away from the stent struts resulting in unacceptable biological responses.</p>
<p>Furthering understanding of the fracture of materials and thin surface coatings commensurate with development of test methods for evaluating fractures and coating defects in metal devices (starting with vascular stents) will advance regulatory science and improve medical product safety.</p>
<p>As a part of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) approved collaborative stent project between the FDA ORA Winchester Engineering and Analytical Center (WEAC) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), there is a need to have stents implanted into porcine coronary arteries (up to three coronary arteries per animal) to determine and understand the conditions that lead to stent fractures and the vascular responses to these fractures. In September, 2011, the FDA contracted with CBSET, Inc. of Lexington, MA to conduct the fractured stent study. This requirement is for the drug-eluting stent stage of the study.</p>

<p>This acquisition is a total small business set aside. The NAICS code associated with this acquisition is 713990 and the small business $7.0 million.</p>
<p><strong>***See attached "Schedule of Items"***<br />Packing Services for 10 Pack Trips</strong></p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/STATEMENT OF WORK</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Specifications</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scope of Contract </strong></p>
<p>The Federal Government has a requirement for a Performance-based Service Contract for the USDA Forest Service, Bitterroot National Forest. Performance-based means the Contractor is responsible for an end product. If an end product is not provided in compliance with the contract specifications, an adjustment to the payment will be made.</p>
<p>The Performance-based Statement of Work shall consist of completing the ordered tasks to the acceptable quality level as defined by the scope of the contract. The awarded contract shall constitute the entire agreement including all terms and conditions applicable to the contract.<br /><br />The Contractor shall provide all expertise, labor, supervision, services, equipment, mobilization, tools, supplies (i.e.; water, etc.), permits, licenses, transportation, and incidentals necessary to provide pack string support for trail crew projects on the Bitterroot National Forest (BRF) for the year 2012. For the most part "the crew" will be a Montana Conservation Corps (MCC) crew. The contractor will pack cargo, tools and food along system trails to campsites and later out to the trailheads using horses and/or mules. Trail crew members will hike in and out. There are 10 scheduled packing dates---packing in constitutes one packing day and the return trip constitutes one packing day. The exact packing dates can change slightly depending on trail conditions but the intent is to stick to the schedule. The performance period will be June 15 to September 30, 2012. Payment will be made for the actual number of days packed each month. The Contractor will provide the packer, a riding animal, four head (at minimum) of pack stock, transportation of all stock, and incidentals such as tack, saddles, manties, ropes, etc.</p>
<p>Many trailheads do not have a stock ramp, or the stock ramp may be blocked by an improperly parked vehicle. The packer must be able to load and unload animals without the aid of stock ramp.</p>
<p>Pack animals must be of acceptable quality, in sound fit condition with only minor cuts and wounds upon initial inspection by the Contracting Officers Representative (COR). An example of unacceptable quality includes but is not limited to any of the following: open, unattended sores, missing shoes with damaged feet, and lameness. Any animal deemed not fit for packing by the government will be checked and documented by a veterinarian at the contractor's expense. The contractor must also be able to provide a brand inspection and interstate transport permits for inspection at the trail head if needed.</p>
<p>The scheduled packing dates may vary slightly by project for various reasons. Packing in may be delayed by the need to clear the trail enough for a pack string or may be delayed for very bad weather. Packing out early may be called for if the project is completed early. The trail crew works on a scheduled work tour with fixed dates so the pack in and pack out dates could vary slightly. The intent is to adhere to the scheduled dates. Any adjustment to a scheduled packing date will be initiated when the COR calls the contractor at an agreed to phone number more than 24 hours in advance. When packing in, the trail crew will have gear and tools ready for packing at the trailhead by 10 AM. The packer will have the gear and tools delivered to camp by 5 PM. When packing out, the trail crew will have gear and tools ready for packing at camp by 8 AM. Some tools may need to be loaded along the trail on the way out. The packer will have the gear and tools delivered to the trailhead by 3 PM.</p>
<p>The packer is not expected to pack more than 100 pounds per side - gross pack weight. Most packs will range from 70-80 pounds. The packer can choose to pack more than 100 pounds per side on any given animal but no provision will be made for extra payment. The contractor will pack duffel, food boxes and backpacks in manties, panniers, or pack boxes to help protect the cargo from abrasion and rain. The trail crew will weigh the cargo and tools to make sure that the packer can pack conventionally sized loads and get by with 4 head of stock. The packer is responsible for making the packs, balancing the loads, loading and unloading the pack animals. If excess cargo is expected for a trip the COR will call the contractor a minimum of 24 hours in advance of the scheduled pack date to make sure the extra pack animals are available for that day.</p>
<p>The packer is expected to have experience and skill in safely packing tools to including but not limited to: 6' cross cut saws, chain saws, "pionjars" (90 lb gas powered jackhammers), rigging gear (griphoist, wire rope, blocks, slings, etc.) fuel, 5' rock bars, loppers, peaveys, pulaskis etc. Sharp tools will be already sheathed but the packer will supply what is needed to lash the tools on or otherwise safely contain the tools being packed. Crosscut saws will not be bent tighter than "U" shape when tied for packing. At the request of the trail crew the packer will unload the tools before reaching camp. Upon delivery at work sites and unload sites, cargo shall be delivered with only normal wear and tear or minor damage. Damage or injury to the stock or packer should be minimized to only minor bumps, cuts, or scraps not requiring vet or doctor care. Incidents causing property damage or injury will prompt a follow-up by the government to discuss with the contractor. Incidents will be evaluated on a case by case basis.</p>
<p>Hazards along the trail include but are not limited to rocks, holes, exposed roots, downed trees, leaning trees, brush, dayhikers, backpackers, bees and dogs. The trail crew may camp beyond where the trail needs improvement. The trail will be improved enough for the pack string to get by. The pack string may have to step over logs, negotiate uneven trail tread or leave the trail for short detours. Final responsibility for successful packing rests with the packer. Although there can be no guarantee that food, tools, camp gear will be delivered undamaged, the packer will demonstrate reasonable care and skill in packing. The packer will also make efforts to ensure public and crew safety during the trip.</p>
<p>In order to stay within the BRF's weed free practices guidelines and prevent noxious weed spread, all animals should be brushed and have their hooves picked clean of mud prior to being transported to the trailhead. All saddle blankets and tack should be clean and free of any weed seeds prior to transport to the load site. Vehicle undercarriages, bumpers, and wheels should have mud and weed seeds removed prior to entering the BRF.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented through FAC 2005-56, effective 2 March 2012 and additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is issued as a Small Business Set Aside (SBSA) under the NAICS 624410 with a small business size standard of $7.0M.  <br><br>The Virginia Army National Guard will conduct three Yellow Ribbon Post Mobilization Events during the periods March 30 - April 1, 2012, April 27-29, 2012 and May 18-20, 2012. Each event will require child care services.  The March 30 - April 1, 2012 event will be held in Williamsburg, VA.  The exact location of the April 27-29, 2012 event has not been determined.  The May 18-20, 2012 event will be held in Richmond, VA.  <br><br>The attached pricing schedules shall be used for pricing.  Unit prices shall be inclusive of all applicable costs and fees associated with providing the required service.  <br><br>The Service Contract Act (SCA) is applicable to this procurement.  As such, the applicable wage determination for the county in which services will be performed, per event, will be made a part of any resulting award.

Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint." <br><br>Award will be made to the low price technically acceptable (LPTA) quote which represents the most advantageous scenario to the government considering the potential for multiple awards.  Therefore, vendors are not required to submit a quote for all events.  It is assumed, for the purpose of evaluating quotes, $500.00 would be the administrative cost to the Government for issuing and administering each purchase order awarded against this solicitation. <br><br>To be determined technically acceptable, interested vendors must certify no caregiver will be allowed to perform services under a contract with the Virginia National Guard (VaNG) until a search of the Criminal Record/Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors (SOR) and Department of Social Services Child Protective Services Central Registry has been completed with no results for the individual caregiver(s).<br><br>FAR provisions 52.212-3, including Alt I shall be completed and returned with your offer.

<p><br />&emsp;<br />Statement of Work<br />Boatyard Services Research Vessel Fulmar<br />NCND6000-12-02109</p>
<p>A] GENERAL INFORMATION:<br />1] This Statement of Work contains the requirements for boatyard services on the NOAA Research Vessel FULMAR (R6701).</p>
<p>2] The general characteristics of the vessel are as follows:<br />Length: 67 feet Beam: 24.5 feet<br />Draft: ~6.1 feet Displacement: ~49 long tons</p>
<p>3] All work is to be accomplished at the Contractor's facility. NOAA will deliver the vessel to the Contractor's facility, and redelivery will also be at the Contractor's facility. The required performance period for all work defined herein is; Phase One: April 1, 2012 to April 27, 2012<br />Phase Two: September 15, 2012 - December 31, 2012</p>
<p>4] Coordination of the work schedules will be the responsibility of the Contractor to avoid any delays or disruptions in order to meet the performance period. The Contractor will provide all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and services required to complete the work UNLESS exceptions are noted in the specified tasks below.</p>
<p>5] Upon arrival at the Contractor's facility the contractor will accept full responsibility for the safety of the vessel, including but not limited to fire protection, security patrols, water-tight integrity, and protection from adverse environmental conditions, etc. This responsibility will terminate only after all work defined herein (or added during the work period) is complete, accepted by NOAA, and NOAA personnel remove the vessel from the Contractor's facility.</p>
<p>6] NOAA employees and contractors may be working on board the vessel during the contract performance period on a not to interfere basis. During this period it will be required that these personnel have full access to the vessel during normal working hours.</p>
<p>7] If the vessel is hauled from the water, the Contractor will ensure that all machinery and equipment used for that purpose is fully functional, suitable for the task, rated for loads at least 20% greater than the maximum weight of the vessel, and operated by trained, competent personnel. The NOAA Contracting Officers Representative (COR) will provide a docking plan for the vessel if requested.</p>
<p>8] All work performed under this SOW (or added to it during the period of performance) will meet or exceed all current requirements of ABYC and USCG (Subchapter T) as applicable to this size and type of vessel, in addition to any specific requirements stated below.</p>
<p>9] In the event defects or damage unrelated to the work tasks defined below are discovered, the Contractor will submit a Condition Found Report (CFR) to the COR. The CFR will define corrective actions needed, the cost for that work (separated into labor, materials, services, and total), and the impact to the performance period.<br />&emsp;</p>
<p>B] PHASE ONE - SPECIFIC WORK TASKS <br />1.1] Replace scientific winch controls<br />Replace the hydraulic solenoid valve bank that powers the Markey COM7 scientific winch and the A-frame with a fully proportional solenoid valve bank. The valve bank will be positioned in the starboard engine room and integrated into the existing hydraulic system. With the new valve bank, winch cable rates (deploy and retrieve) will be fully proportional and variable between 1.50 and 70.0 meters per minute (full drum) with payloads ranging from 0 pounds to the maximum rated capacity of the winch. In particular, winch drum rotation will start and stop from any given line speed with any given load in a smooth and controllable manner, and allow the deployment of as little as one inch of cable at a time. A-frame rotational travel rates will be fully proportional and variable between 12 and 200 arc-degrees per minute with payloads ranging from 0 pounds to the maximum rated capacity of the A-frame. The solenoid valves and all components attached to them will be waterproof and corrosion resistant. All components exposed to the weather will be waterproof, salt-spray proof, humidity proof, corrosion resistant, and rated for full operation at temperatures between minus 20F and 140F. Provide and install all required piping, fittings, pressure relief valves, flow controls, etc. required to attain full functionality of both devices. Existing hydraulic system components may be re-used if demonstrated by the contractor to be in good condition.</p>
<p>In conjunction with above, replace the electronic joy sticks in the lab and on the 01 deck that control the winch and A-frame valve bank. The joy sticks will be entirely compatible with the new solenoid valves, and that allow both minimum and maximum travel simultaneous with a high degree of smooth, proportional control at all loads and speeds. If 100% of the speed ranges stated above are not attainable by the movement of the jog levers alone (highly preferred), any auxiliary control device required will be positioned immediately next to the levers, and articulated in an intuitive manner without disassembly or tools of any kind. Joysticks and all associated components will be waterproof, salt-spray proof, humidity proof, corrosion resistant, and rated for full operation at temperatures between minus 20F and 140F. Provide and install all wiring, controls, mounting hardware, etc. required to attain full functionality of both devices. Existing wiring maybe re-used if demonstrated by the contractor to be in good condition.</p>
<p>During trials, the contractor will demonstrate the smooth and accurate function of the winch at all speeds, loads, and deployed cable lengths defined by the COR. The A-frame will also be demonstrated at travels rates and loads of both ~25 and ~600 pounds, the test weights being provided by the contractor. NOAA will provide vessel and equipment operators.</p>
<p>1.2] Resolve electrical system problems<br />The vessel electrical system has exhibited unusual behavior: <br />A) When connected to &lsquo;shorepower', the Outback charging system appears to be drawing a much higher than expected amperage for normal house battery charging causing certain (subpanel) higher amperage breakers (e.g., microwave oven) to trip. This condition does not occur when vessel power is provided by generator sources. Local electrician did not find any anomalies in breaker function. <br />B) The vessel has exhibited detrimental variations in charge current from both starboard main engine and generator alternators. Discuss the problem with the vessel captain (or other NOAA staff present), and perform limited testing to determine the cause. <br />C) Remove galvanic isolator installed underneath helm dashboard.</p>
<p>Draft a CFR that proposes correction of the problem and includes a breakdown of costs of materials, labor, subcontract services (if any), and impact on completion schedule.</p>
<p><br />1.3] Create emergency lighting circuits<br />Provide a secondary source of DC battery power to the low-level lighting in both focsles that allows them to automatically illuminate in the event all AC and DC power aboard the vessel is shutoff at the panels. Add similar lights on this same secondary circuit to ensure illumination of the steps up to the pilothouse and the companionway area from those steps to the galley entrance. Install a shut-off switch for all lights above that allows the emergency function to be disabled in the event all power is intentionally shut down. Position this shut-off switch in a prominent location near the head of the focsle stairs, and label the switch as follows in &frac12;" tall red block letters:<br />"Emergency lighting control - Disable lights only at dockside when all power is intentionally shutdown."</p>
<p>1.4] Design, plan and prepare order for replacement main anchor winch<br />Develop a design for a new anchor winch with a new winch of similar design, construction, and outfitting but having a 4" or larger diameter drum. The new winch will be fitted with a similar level wind, but this will be driven by an independent hydraulic motor, and controlled by an independent hydraulic valve that allows variation of level wind speed independent of drum speed. Use the existing hydraulic piping routed to the winch location for the new winch and level wind. NOAA will consider relocating the anchor from the current recessed position to a forward overhanging position if the new winch design would become more effective.</p>
<p><br />C] PHASE TWO - SPECIFIC WORK TASKS <br />2.1] Haul, clean, block, store, and launch<br />Remove the vessel from the water. Pressure-wash the entire hull from sheer line to keel removing all dirt, grime, and marine growth. If the vessel is a catamaran, clean all surfaces within the tunnel. Similarly, clean all fittings below waterline, including propulsor components, struts, stern tubes, rudders, foils, fins, through-hulls, etc. Do not damage any existing anti-fouling paint unless further tasks in this SOW require its removal. Clean transducers with a non-metallic brush, taking care to not mar the emitting surface in any way. Clean all surfaces of all anodes with a wire brush unless they are to be replaced.</p>
<p>Block the vessel in a level attitude with the keel (or keels) 36" minimum off the ground. Inspect the hull, coatings, and all attachments and report any damage or discrepancies to the COR in writing. Provide electrical power to the vessel suitable for its shore power system.</p>
<p>Upon completion of all work done on the hard, launch the vessel, inspect all compartments for leaks, and secure it dockside. If dockside testing or underway trials are required after launch, provide prior notification to the COR so NOAA personnel can attend.</p>
<p>2.2] Underbody coating system<br />Prepare and touch-up any flaws in the underbody coating system with the same coating as currently applied (Sea Hawk Smart Solution 4700 series). Manufacturer's procedures will be used in all cases. Color to match existing coatings. The contractor will ensure that all the environmental conditions are within the manufacture's specified parameters prior to starting application processes and for all coatings. Upon completion, schedule an inspection of the coating system by the COR.</p>
<p>2.3] Replace cutlass bearings and shaft seal boots<br />Replace both cutlass bearing on each propeller shaft in kind. New bearings will be secured in place by Chockfast and SST set screws. Replace both shaft seal boots in kind, along with the hose clamps that secure the boots to the stern tube and the seal. If installed, inspect the raw water supply to the shaft seal and provide a written report on condition, including a CFR if repairs are required. Retain the old bearings and boots until they can be inspected by the COR. Upon completion, trial the vessel to prove bearings run free from vibration and the shaft seals are tight at all speeds and power settings.</p>
<p>2.4] Replace starboard ME exhaust elbow and spool piece<br />Remove the molded EPDM exhaust elbow from the starboard main engine exhaust discharge port. Cut away the 10" aluminum pipe spool piece from the discharge port hull side insert and replace in kind. Install a new EPDM elbow, and replace all clamps. After launching, test the repairs at engine full throttle under load to prove no leaks are present.</p>
<p>2.5] Install and test anchor winch<br />Replace the anchor winch with a new winch of similar design, construction, and outfitting but having a 4" or larger diameter drum. The new winch will be fitted with a similar level wind, but this will be driven by an independent hydraulic motor, and controlled by an independent hydraulic valve that allows variation of level wind speed independent of drum speed. Use the existing hydraulic piping routed to the winch location for the new winch and level wind.</p>
<p>2.6] Inspect all seacocks</p>
<p>2.7] Pressure test foils, strakes, guards</p>
<p>D] IT Security Requirements <br />The Certification and Accreditation (C&amp;A) requirements of 48 CFR 1352.239-73 do not apply, and a Security Accreditation Package is not required.<br />The contractor will not have access to any government owned IT equipment or be furnished government privileged information. However, the contractor will have full access to the vessel and all of its systems. <br />E] AWARD BASIS <br />Performance factors are equal to price. Contractor must demonstrate past performance in working with aluminum high speed catamaran vessels including aluminum welding.<br />For excessively long transits from the vessels home port (greater than 14hrs one way), the government at its discretion may consider the cost for transit including crew, fuel, &amp; consumables in its basis for award. <br />F] NOAA COR/CONTACT<br />David Lott<br />NOAA ONMS WCR<br />99 Pacific Street<br />STE 200K<br />Monterey, CA 93940<br />831-241-3097</p>

The deadline for submission of questions regarding RFP0002-12 is March 13, 2012 at 2:00 p.m. EST. The Government will not reimburse interested parties for any cost associated with responding to this business opportunity. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. The anticipated contract award date is on or before April 20, 2012.<br /><br />If the offeror has any supplemental agreements, those agreements should be submitted with the proposal. If the offeror requires signature of a supplemental agreement that was not submitted with the proposal, the proposal will be rejected.<br /><br />Basis for Award<br /><br />The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible offeror whose proposal is responsive to the solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government, using the tradeoff approach. Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each offeror's proposal against the evaluation criteria described below. In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to make an award to the offeror with the highest technically rated proposal rather than making an award at the lowest evaluated price. Thus, to the extent that offeror's technical and past performance proposals are evaluated as equal, the evaluated price is more likely to be a determining factor.<br /><br />Factor I, Technical Capabilities (a) Contract requirements: Proposals will be evaluated on the Offeror's ability to provide all of the contract requirements relating to lodging, meeting space, food and beverage, A/V equipment and support, business center requirements, and reporting requirements. Proposals must address the Offeror's ability to comply with the Americans with Disability Act (ADA) as it relates to lodging and meeting space. Proposals will be evaluated on the quality of the customer services provided and the quality of the facilities reflected in maintenance and upkeep of the facilities. (b) Location: Proposals will be evaluated on the ability of Offeror to provide a centrally located facility with inexpensive transportation options to and from the airport, and local restaurants and other area attractions within a short walking distance (10 minutes or less) of the proposed facility in the preferred cities specified. Proposals must address safety and security issues both within the hotel complex and the surrounding area. Proposals will be evaluated on the ability of the Offeror to provide the required services at the preferred locations. (c) Availability of Dates. Proposals will be evaluated on the ability of the Offeror to provide the required services on the preferred dates requested.<br /><br />Factor II, Past Performance (a) The offeror must provide references for at least three (3) government or non-government contracts which provide the same or similar services; contracts must have been awarded within the past three (3) years. Contact information should include the following: Name and address of government agency or other nongovernment client; Name, title, email and telephone number of Contracting Officer, or other point of contact; name, title, email and telephone number of client's program manager, if applicable; contract number, period of performance, and total dollar value of contract; and, description of services provided. List any problems encountered on each contract and the offeror's corrective actions. EEOC will evaluate past performance based on timeliness, customer service, and corrective actions taken (if necessary). (b) In the event that a quoter has no Past Performance history, this rating factor will be considered neutral and will neither increase nor decrease the overall rating.<br /><br />Factor III, Price: The government will evaluate price proposal submitted in comparison to the Independent Government Cost Estimate.<br />Site Visit: The EEOC reserves the right to conduct a site visit of all offerors who are rated to be technically acceptable. The site visit will review and evaluate the same technical items identified in the Technical Capabilities Portion of the technical evaluation factors.<br /><br />Evaluation of Options<br /><br />Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best <br />interests, the Government will evaluate proposals for award purposes by adding the total price for all <br />options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br /><br />Notice: The Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the vendor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The Government also reserves the right to conduct a site visit prior to award. The provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. The provisions at 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. The vendor shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with your proposal. The vendor shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.222-52 Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Certain Services- Certification with your proposal.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), Aviation Logistics Center (ALC), Industrial Operations Division(IOD) Contracting Branch intends to issue a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order using the procedures of FAR Part 12 and Part 13. This RFQ incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-56. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 327910. The small business size standard is 500 employees.
<p>This requirement is for the following:<br />E-STRIP, GPX Blast Media<br />Type VII (Starch-g-Acrylic) blast media that meets the requirements of Military Specification MIL-P-85891A, "Plastic Media for Removal of Organic Coatings" and ALC Engineering Specification GEN 13410.07B. <br />Type VII (Starch-g-Acrylic) blast media is an environmentally friendly product used for paint removal. It is non-toxic, biodegradable. The availability of this blast media fits with the engineering concerns related to the surface alteration and/or damage often related to the use of plastic abrasive used on Coast Guard aircraft undergoing maintenance at ALC. It removes a wide variety of coatings, from common polyurethane/epoxy paint systems, to more sophisticated systems such as rain erosion resistant coatings and radar absorbing material. It also removes vinyl from aircraft interior panels, sealants form components and/or fuel cells, and paint from cadmium plated parts where the plating was left intact. Selective layer stripping without substrate damage, and that it is detectable under black lighting for easy detection during post-strip inspection, are other characteristics of this product. Its use can replace chemical and plastic bead paint stripping systems traditionally used and limits exposure of personnel to hazardous materials.</p>
<p>In addition to the supply of the blast media, the offeror must be able to provide a spent media recycling and disposal service that meets ALC's mission of sustainable environmental stewardship.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester shall file a formal agency protest to&nbsp;both the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, and the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

<p>15. 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer/quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting</p>
<p>contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

This Amendment three (03) is issued for clarification purposes as well as extension of due date.  The date and time quotes are due is changed to 03/23/2012 3:00 EDT.  This amendment also addresses the majority of offeror questions which were submitted to the CO previously.				 														1.) The original solicitation states evaluation factors as the following:					
Factor 1: Technical
a)	Management Approach and Capabilities
b)	Staffing (resumes are an attachment)
c)	Quality Control Plan (limited to 5 pages)
Factor 2: Past Performance (limited to 5)
Factor 3: Socioeconomic
	Factor 4: Price																								For further clarification, Factor 1; Technical Volume of your quote shall contain all of the requested information now listed as Factor 1: Technical sub-factor a) Management approach and capabilities.													For further clarification, the Business Volume of your quote shall contain what originally was included in sub-factor b) Staffing, and sub-factor c) Quality Control Plan.					For further clarification, both the Technical Volume and the Business Volume shall not exceed ten (10) pages each separately.  The resumes and QCP as stated shall be included as separate attachments and do not count towards the Technical or Business volume page limitations.					Due to repeated (and current) requests, the submission of your quotes may be electronic directed solely to the Contracting Officer at michael.norton3@va.gov.  If you submit your complete quote (technical, business, socioeconomic concerns and pricing plus all attachments) electronically you are still required to submit your quote as one (1) hard copies as well as one (1) CD.  If not then five (5) hard copies and two (2) copies on CDs will still be required.							For further clarification, all offeror questions received were addressed in the previous amendment (02) with the exception of the following specific questions:						There are no point values or individual weights assigned to the evaluation factors that are not stated in the RFQ.												VA Small Business Goals are a total of 34% for 2012-2013.  SDVOSB goals for the VA are 10% for prime contractors and 3% for sub contractors.							The RFQ states GFE "may" be included so that depends on the type and scope of the individual BPA order.												There are and will not be any ODCs in this RFQ nor resulting BPA orders.  Once again, this is a FFP BPA in which individual BPA orders may be either FFP or Labor Hours.  Your rates, thus your costs, are determined by your MOBIS rates and any offered discount at time of award.				VAAA utilizes the same IMI interactivity levels as does DoD.  Specific definitions will be provided at each BPA Order level.										It is intended that contractor design teams will work with VAAA instructional designers to develop segments of the whole.											There is no SF30 associated with this amendment.  All amendments need to be acknowledged as noted in the RFQ, bottom of page six (6.)																					It is highly recommended that potential offerors read Amendment two (2) in its entirety if you haven't already done so.  It is posted on the Vendor Portal as well as GSA eBuy - which everyone should have been notified of. 																												This is the end of this Amendment (03).  mjn

The HQAMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an alternative dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. These procedures apply to the HQAMC-Level Protest Program only.<BR><BR>* Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. Federal Government employees, unions or installations are not considered interested parties for the purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest.<BR><BR>* Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated. * Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day. * Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed. * Required information: Protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester. o Protesters name o Address o Telephone number o Fax number o Solicitation or contract number o Identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officers name o Detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest) o Copies of all relevant documents o Request for a ruling o Request for relief<BR><BR>* Where to file: An agency protest may be filed with either the contracting officer or to HQAMC. o Protest to HQAMC shall be filed at: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 Fax: (703) 806-8866 or 8875 o Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel Room 2-1SE3401 1412 Jackson Loop Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 o Protest to Contracting Officer shall be filed at: Appropriate installation address or see FAR Clause 52.233-2 in section L for address. * Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. * Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o Terminate the contract o Recompete the requirement o Issue a new solicitation o Refrain from exercising options under the contract o Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect.<BR><BR>* Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). * Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 52.233-4703 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM 05/01/2004 If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 Facsimile Number: (703) 806-8866 or 8875 Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel Room 2-1SEC3401 1412 Jackson Loop Ft.

<p>Duration of any resultant contract is a base period of 1 year and two 1 year option periods for a total maximum of 3 years.</p>
<p>Base period is from date of award through one year. Option periods if exercised will start the day after the previous period expires. Maximum total of time is 3 years. <br /><br />This requirement is 100% set aside for small business.</p>
<p>NAICS code is 323119 and the size standard is 500 Employees The resulting contract and orders issued will be firm-fixed price.</p>
<p>An Indefinite Quantity, Indefinite Delivery Contract will be issued from this RFQ. <br />The Government minimum per Base or Option Period is $75,000.00 The maximum amount per Base or Option period is $800,000.00. The minimum per task order is $500.00. The maximum per task order issued is $200,000.00. Government anticipates an initial provisioning order during the base period to be shipped to all sites listed.

<p>Required delivery Timeframes:</p>
<p>1. Within Continental US: 30 days after receipt of delivery order<br />2. Outside Continental US: 45 days after receipt of delivery order</p>

Pricing for the expedited lines should reflect the additional costs of delivering the items to the site within the expedited period. Regular shipping costs for normal delivery timeframes should already be included in the unit price of items 0001, 1001, 2001, 0002, 1002, 2002, 0003, 1003, 2003.</p>

<DESC>At the walk-through held on March 1, 2012, some questions from the contractors came up that were answered by the engineer from PB Dewberry pertaining to the scope of work.&nbsp; THe questions and answers are listed below:<br /><br />
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Question: </span></span></strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Number 5 on page 9 under Extent of Work- Are the secondary pans only to be installed with the 7 new units or should there be a secondary pan under all 20 units to prevent over-spill? </span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Answer: </span></span></strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">A secondary pan should be installed on all twenty (20) units to prevent over-spill. </span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Question: </span></span></strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Number 9 on page 10 under Extent of Work- Should they replace the filters on all 20 units? And there was some confusion about the return air filter grill. Should that be for all 20 or just new units? </span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Answer: </span></span></strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The filters should be replaced by the contractor at all manufacture recommended locations for all twenty units.&nbsp; This should include the return grill and at the unit location for all twenty units unless specified otherwise by the manufacture. </span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Question: </span></span></strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">On section e. page 7, if there is no asbestos in the building would there be a need for Asbestos/Environmental Liability?&nbsp; does that cover more than just asbestos or what? </span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Answer: </span></span></strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Coverage is required in the event that asbestos is present and/or uncovered as an unforeseen during the project.&nbsp; If there is no asbestos currently present then the coverage would not apply, but the contractor must be able to obtain such coverage and would be required in the event of asbestos being found during the project. </span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">**Recommend extending the bid date by seven (7) calendar days from March 15, 2012 to March 22, 2012 and revise deadline time that day to allow for FedEx and UPS to deliver and the center to receive proposals on March 22, 2012. </span></strong></p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list.

The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. If repair/replacement or reperformance will not correct the defects or is not possible, the government may seek an equitable price reduction or adequate consideration for acceptance of nonconforming supplies or services. The Government must exercise its post-acceptance rights --
(1) Within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and
(2) Before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item.

(e) Definitions. The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference.

The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing as soon as it is reasonably possible after the commencement of any excusable delay, setting forth the full particulars in connection therewith, shall remedy such occurrence with all reasonable dispatch, and shall promptly give written notice to the Contracting Officer of the cessation of such occurrence.<BR><BR>(g) Invoice.

(9) The specification.<BR><BR>(t) Central Contractor Registration (CCR).
(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 
(2) 
(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to:
(A) Change the name in the CCR database; 
(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;
(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. 
(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor?s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.<BR><BR>Alternate I (Oct 2008) When a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract is contemplated, substitute the following paragraphs (a), (e), (i) and (l) for those in the basic clause.
(a) Inspection/Acceptance. 
(1) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.
(2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties.
(3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier.
(4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the ?hourly rate? for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the ?hourly rate? attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.]<BR><BR>

<DESC>Questions
VA251-12-Q-0135-A00001

QUESTION:   We produce and sell plastic gift cards to retail entities but this solicitation appears to be geared toward the purchase of 550 pre-existing gift cards with a value of $50 each from Meijer. Outside of the volume purchase discount or, perhaps, government regulations that disallow your direct purchase of gift cards we are not sure we understand the role of the dealer in this solicitation. Can you clarify?

ANSWER:  This solicitation is part of the VA commitment to support small businesses.  The vendor will obtain and ship the cards to our facility.
QUESTION:  Will payment be made available using a Government Purchase Card at time of order?  Meijer Corporation will not begin fulfillment of the Gift Cards until payment has cleared.
ANSWER:  Payment terms are NET 15.  A receiving report will be processed at the VA Ann Arbor warehouse when the cards are received.  This receiving report will be matched to the contractor's invoice submitted to the VA Financial Management system in Austin TX.  Once this matching occurs, payment will be made within 15 days.
QUESTION:  Can Payment be made available via a Check at the time of order?     Meijer offers additional discounts, if this is possible.
ANSWER:  As noted above, payment will occur within 15 days after receipt of the gift cards at the VA Ann Arbor warehouse.  The contractor will be established in the VA Financial Management system.  Payment will be via EFT once the invoice and receiving report are matched.
QUESTION:  Does each card require an individual envelope?
ANSWER:  No.
QUESTION:   Are there any packaging requirement for the final deliverable?     Can they be delivered unbound in a box/envelope(s)?
ANSWER:  We have no specific packaging requirement.  Yes, they can be delivered unbound in a box/envelope.  The packaging of the cards needs to be secure enough to be received safely in our warehouse without damage to the contents.
QUESTION:  Can the Gift Cards be mailed directly to the Place of Performance, from Meijer?
ANSWER:  Yes.  But it is very important that the Purchase order number assigned to these gift cards be referenced on the package so that it can be properly identified when received in our warehouse.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. <br /><br /><br />THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. This RFI is issued for the purpose of developing a viable solicitation that will best communicate the Government's requirements to industry. Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. The requested information is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of the submission of contractors' information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL INFORMATION.</strong> The 772 Enterprise Sourcing Squadron (ESS) in conjunction with the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), Lackland Air Force Base, TX, is planning to contract with Architect-Engineer (A-E) firms to perform worldwide and regional Title I, Title II, and other A-E services to administer, coordinate, and technically support Environmental, Military Construction (MILCON), Military Family Housing (MFH), and Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization (SRM) programs of interest to the Government.</p>
<p>We anticipate multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract awards and anticipate using NAICS codes 541330 and 562910. The small business size standard associated with NAICS code 541330 is $4.5M. <strong>(NOTE: Effective 12 March 2012, the size standard will be $14.0M for NAICS code 541330.)</strong> The small business size standard associated with NAICS code 562910 is 500 employees.</p>
<p>We anticipate awarding Engineering Services (NAICS 541330) contracts to large and small businesses. In addition to awarding suites of worldwide contracts, we are contemplating regionalizing contracts for services for Continental United States (CONUS) (defined as the lower 48 states, Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. territories) installations and dedicating suites of small business IDIQ contracts to each region. The scope of A-E services (i.e. Title I/II &amp; Other A-E Services) will be similar for all contracts. The type of projects/programs for the worldwide suites will include MILCON, MFH, SRM and Contingency projects. The type of projects/programs for the regional suites will include SRM projects.</p>
<p>We anticipate awarding Environmental Remediation Services (NAICS 562910) contracts to small businesses. The scope of A-E services will include Title I/II &amp; Other A-E Services. The types of projects/programs will include Environmental Remediation, Environmental Compliance (EC), and Environmental Quality (EQ) projects. Work will be performed primarily in CONUS. There may be a small amount of OCONUS work anticipated.</p>
<p>All sub-categories of small businesses are being looked at during our market research phase. At this time, we are considering that task orders under these contracts will be negotiated as either Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) or Firm Fixed Price (FFP) orders, depending on the nature of the requirement. Additionally, we anticipate that each contract will have a basic ordering period of five (5) years with two additional years for performance. Central Contract Registration (CCR) will be mandatory for these contracts (see CCR website at <a href="http://www.ccr.gov">www.ccr.gov</a>).</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND AND PROGRAM INFORMATION.</strong> These IDIQ contracts will serve to functionally replace services contained within AFCEE's existing Worldwide Planning, Program, and Design (4P A-E08) contracts. The ordering period under the 4P A-E08 contracts expire during the Feb - Aug 2013 timeframe. <br /><br /><strong>ANTICIPATED GENERAL SCOPE OF <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ENGINEERING SERVICES</span> (NAICS 541330)<br /></strong>To provide Title I, Title II, and Other A-E Services for traditional MILCON, Military Family Housing (including projects related to Privatized Housing), and SRM requirements. Requirements for CONUS regional suites will include SRM projects. Requirements for worldwide suites will include MILCON, MFH, SRM and Contingency projects. Some CONUS projects may be limited to worldwide suites dependent upon schedule, complexity and dollar value. The anticipated services include:</p>

<p><strong>Request comment from interested parties to the following questions:</strong></p>
<p>1. What are your thoughts about separating the A-E requirements into two separate contracts, Environmental Remediation (NAICS 562910) and Engineering Services (541330)?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In regard to Environmental Remediation Services (NAICS 562910) only (questions 2 &amp;3)</span></strong></p>
<p>2. Do you have any thoughts or concerns about setting aside all environmental remediation requirements to small business?</p>
<p>3. What is your business size? If you are a small business, do you also qualify under any of the sub-categories (8(a), small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, service disabled veteran-owned small business, and HBCU/MI)?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In regard to Engineering Services (NAICS 541330) only (questions 4-6)</span></strong></p>
<p>4. Do you have any thoughts or concerns about reserving all of the CONUS regional contracts for small business?</p>
<p>5. As previously noted, some CONUS projects may be issued against the worldwide contracts. What would your recommended project parameters include (i.e. "X" dollar value, "X" project type) to move a requirement from a regional CONUS contract to the worldwide contract?</p>
<p>6. There is a potential to establish only three regions (i.e. East, West and Central) for the CONUS Engineering Services efforts. Do you have any thoughts or concerns about your firm's capacity to cover large CONUS regions?</p>
<p>7. Do you have any other comments or suggestions that you would like to share with us?</p>
<p>Please include the following with your response: name and address of firm; size of business; point of contact and telephone number, average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees, classification standard i.e. large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, etc, affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, and potential teaming partners.</p>

     (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
 
     (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
 
     (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
 
     (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
 
       (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
 
         (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
 
         (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
 
       (ii) Examples.
 
         (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
 
         (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
 
   (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
 
     (1) Listed end products.

       (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
 
       (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
 
     (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--
 
       (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
 
       (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
 
   (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

<p><br />The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), National Institutes of Health (NIH) requires services to provide operation and maintenance to the Central Utility Plant (CUP) at the NIH Research Triangle Park, North Carolina location. The CUP provides all utility services for heating, cooling, electrical distribution, and hazardous waste incineration for NIH s National Institute of Environment Health Sciences (NIEHS) campus and the adjoining campus of the Environmental Protection Agency at Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: The NIEHS Campus, completed in 1982, is Government-owned, expandable location which includes administration, laboratory, and support facilities. The NIEHS Campus consists of 374.5 acres of land, eight buildings, roadways, parking areas, and an underground utilities system. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also has a facility located on the adjoining Government owned property which includes approximately 1,000,000 sq. ft. of office and laboratory space. This facility is heated and cooled from the NIEHS CUP.</p>
<p>The NIEHS and EPA are research complexes containing complicated and sophisticated building environmental support and utility systems to support long term research. Animals are widely used in this research. These test animals are housed in very tightly controlled conditions of temperature and humidity, and are supplied with conditioned air that has been filtered to remove microorganisms and chemicals which could adversely affect the outcome of a research project. Laboratories contain extremely complex and expensive test equipment which requires, in many cases, a very closely controlled environment to function properly. Responsiveness and skill by contractor employees to operate, maintain, repair and restore operation and control of the utilities support systems is extremely critical for the protection of the integrity of the many research programs being conducted at this facility.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES: Provide all personnel, supervision, management, equipment, materials, supplies, tools, and all other items necessary to operate and maintain the CUP, which provides all utilities services for heating, cooling, electrical distribution, and hazardous waste incineration for the NIH/NIEHS North Carolina Facilities and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

Services shall include, but not limited to, operation of utilities systems and their associated mechanical/electrical plants; preventive maintenance and repair maintenance on utility plants and equipment. The contractor will be required to operate, maintain and repair all mechanical, electrical and utility systems in four buildings which include 1) Consolidated Computer Room, 2) Central Utility Plant, 3) Incinerator Building, and 4) Electrical Sub-Station. Three of the buildings include distribution of high voltage electricity, high temperature hot water (HTHW), chilled water (CHW). The requirement includes operations, maintenance and management of repair of all underground and above ground distribution piping and wiring and equipment associated with electricity, HTHW, CHW, PW (Domestic Water; underground piping only), valve pits and sewer effluent piping and fire protection distribution piping, and system controls up to and including the first cut-off valve or disconnect inside all buildings on the NIH/NIEHS Campus and between the CUP and the outlet of the isolation valve within the valve pits serving the EPA Campus. Contractor personnel shall have experience with various sizes and types of complex equipment. Examples would be experience with high temperature hot water generators (40 MBTU each), water chillers (3,500 tons each), electrical substation distribution (13,800 volts), hazardous waste incineration, wet scrubber operation and the operations of facilities that contain multipurpose laboratories to include animal laboratories.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a presolicitation notice.<br />The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NOAA Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Marine Mammal Laboratory is seeking a contractor to provide a charter vessel (including crew) for up to 33 days during Aug - Sep 2012.<br />The anticipated requirement will be issued under Solicitation AB133F-12-RQ-0205<br />The objective of the research is to conduct passive acoustic monitoring studies and oceanographic sampling to determine abundance, migratory patterns, acoustic ecology, and foraging ecology of cetaceans and their prey. In addition, biological and population studies of large whales will be continued in the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas by deploying radio and satellite transmitters on whales, conducting photo-identification, and biopsy sampling.<br />There may be 4 additional option days used to work additional areas following the main cruise.<br />The cruise will depart from and return to Dutch Harbor, AK. Sonobuoys will be deployed round the clock during the transit to acoustically monitor for the presence of whales. Also during transit to the working area one or more onshore/offshore transects (CTD and net tows) will be conducted. Once in the working area, approximately 30 moorings containing passive acoustic recorders, active acoustic instruments, and a variety of oceanographic instrumentation will be retrieved and re-deployed at predetermined locations throughout the study area. At least six onshore/offshore transects (each consisting of approximately 10 CTD/net tow stations) will be conducted in the study area. In addition, dragging along the seafloor will be conducted in an attempt to recover moorings as necessary from previous years. Additional personnel or equipment may need to be picked up and/or dropped off in Nome, Wainwright, Kotzebue, Barrow, or any other suitable transfer location near the working grounds. <br />In addition to the 29 charter days and the 4 optional charter days, two weeks of dwell time are required in Seattle WA for installation of Government Owned equipment prior to the vessel's departure for Dutch Harbor AK.

THIS IS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Southwest is seeking comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for a large scale construction project (exceeding $25 million) within the Yuma, AZ area. 

This is a new procurement. It does not replace an existing contract.
 No prior contract information exists. The target award range is $25-$100 Million. This project consists of constructing a Field-Carrier Landing Practice (FCLP) training facility with Landing Helicopter Dock (LHD) training facilities to support the new Joint Strike Fighter Aviator Landing Skills Program. The work includes the following primary items: flight control tower and air operation facility, fire and rescue shelter, aircraft fueling areas, aircraft maintenance shelter, taxiway, airfield pavement, storm drainage structures, infrastructure including non-potable water supply (drilling of wells) and storage, multiple miles of electrical and communications wiring, fire protection system, and access roadway and parking, and incidental related work.
 This project fulfills critical requirements to support the establishment of the JSF squadrons at MCAS Yuma. The facility is to be built in a remote location on the Barry M. Goldwater Range (BMGR) that contains general range-related debris and Materials Potentially Presenting an Explosive Hazard (MPPEH). The appropriate North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Codes are 236220 & 237310 with Small Business Size Standards of $33.5M and $33.5M respectively. 

The use of a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is being considered for this project pursuant to Executive Order 13502, Use of Project Labor Agreements for Federal Construction Projects (February 6, 2009).

A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C 158(f).
 Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) Be consistent with law.

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I. INTRODUCTION: <br /></strong></span>This announcement describes a revolutionary research program, "Enhancing Intuitive Decision Making Through Implicit Learning" to be launched under the ONRBAA12-001, Long Range Broad Agency Announcement for Navy and Marine Corps Science and Technology which can be found at http://www.onr.navy.mil/Contracts-Grants/Funding-Opportunities/Broad-Agency-Announcements.aspx. The research opportunity described in this announcement specifically falls under numbered paragraphs 5 of the Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare &amp; Combating Terrorism Department (Code 30) sub section and 1 of the Warfighter Performance Human and Bioengineered Systems (Code 34) subsection. The submission of proposals, their evaluation and the placement of basic research contracts and grants will be carried out as described in that Broad Agency Announcement. <br />The purpose of this announcement is to focus the attention of the scientific community on (1) the area to be studied, and (2) the planned timetable for the submission of white papers and full proposals. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">II. TOPIC DESCRIPTION: <br /></span></strong>Research in human pattern recognition and decision-making suggest that there is a "sixth sense" through which humans can detect and act on unique patterns without consciously and intentionally analyzing them. Evidence is accumulating that this capability, known as intuition or intuitive decision making, enables the rapid detection of patterns in ambiguous, uncertain and time restricted information contexts, that it informs the decision making process and, most importantly, that it may not require domain expertise to be effective. These properties make intuition a strong candidate for further exploration as the basis for developing a new set of decision support training technologies.<br />The proposed topic will lead to new insights into intuitive decision making, and develop new approaches for enhancing this process. The proposed topic will do this by: <br />&bull; Characterizing the nature of intuition at the neural, cognitive and behavioral levels in order to develop approaches to train &amp; measure it<br />&bull; Developing a computational cognitive model of intuition, in order to facilitate the delivery of scenario based training to enhance intuitive decision making<br />&bull; Demonstrating that implicit learning techniques, guided by these models and embedded in a scenario based training technology, can enhance intuitive decision making in non-experts, in order to increase baseline abilities to make more effective decisions under conditions in which information is ambiguous, and time to analyze is restricted <br />The program will pursue a wide variety of approaches that address four challenges that are key to understanding and enhancing intuitive decision making: 1) Combining advances in measuring performance at multiple representation levels (e.g, neural, cognitive &amp; behavioral) with advances in simulation - based paradigms for assessing decision making to understand the foundations of intuitive decision making; 2) Leveraging advances in cognitive modeling and machine learning techniques to represent individual intuitive decision making processes; 3) Developing an implicit learning based approach for enhancing intuitive decision making; and, 4) Combining these efforts, through scenario/simulation based training, to test and validate the hypothesis that implicit learning can enhance intuitive decision making for one or more operationally valid tasks.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background: <br /></span>This topic outlines four challenges that must be addressed in order to develop training technologies for intuitive decision making. First, the nature of intuitive decision making must be characterized, at the neural, cognitive and behavioral levels. Second, these characterizations must be integrated into a single model, providing the foundation for developing adaptive and individualized training technologies. Third, implicit learning based paradigms for enhancing intuitive decision making must be developed. Fourth, the resultant measures, models and learning approach must be implemented into a training technology that demonstrably enhances an individual warfighters' intuitive decision making capabilities.<br />"In hindsight, some of the soldiers acknowledge their "spidey sense" was tingling.

Thanks to the awareness and quick actions of a 99th Regional Readiness Command (RRC) Soldier, however, no one was seriously injured by the [IED] attack--and he did this all while communicating with his wife on a cell phone..." - Soldier's intuition and situational awareness a lifesaver in Iraq.(UPDATE ON Operation Iraqi Freedom)Publication: Army Reserve Magazine Publication Date: 22-MAR-07Author: Coleman, Chris <br />Today's military missions pose complex time-constrained challenges, such as detecting IED emplacements while in a moving vehicle or detecting anomalous civilian behaviors indicative of impending danger. These challenges are compounded by recent doctrinal requirements that require less-experienced Warfighters to make ever-more complex decisions. Current understanding of decision making, which is based on concepts developed around theories of analytic decision making (Newell and Simon, 1972), cannot effectively address these new challenges since they are based on the notion of enabling experts to apply their expertise to addressing new problems. <br />Yet, there are actually two types of recognized decision making processes, analytical and intuitive which appear to be mediated by different processes or systems (Ross et al, 2004; Evans, 2008; Kahneman &amp; Klein, 2009). Analytical decision making is mediated by processes that reflect a sequential, step-by-step, methodical, and time consuming process. In contrast, intuitive decision making relies upon a more holistic approach to processing information. Importantly, intuitive decision making can support analytic decision making processing to continue accounting for prospective outcomes as the external problem space changes (Evans, 2008). Intuition is a rapid, non-conscious, cue to the existence of meaningful information detected through one or more sensory modalities (Luu et al, 2010). Intuition permits information extracted by automatic sensory processes, which operate on the time scale of 100's of milliseconds, to be organized by pre-existing (top-down) knowledge. This unconscious organization of incoming information may elicit a feeling or impression of a solution (Luu et al, 2010), which precedes insight or a sudden awareness of the solution. Recent studies suggest that these systems can also be distinguished on the basis of the neural structures that facilitate their actions (Lieberman, 2000, 2007; Volz, 2008; Luu, 2010). <br />According to Bowers et al. (1990) intuition can guide the judgment process by assisting with the discovery of plausible solutions from which to choose. This characterization of intuition, and many others that follow from it, assumes a high level of familiarity with the information being detected. In fact, until recently, intuitive decision making was assumed to require significant domain expertise (Kahneman &amp; Klein, 2009). Yet a growing body of results ranging from the biological (mainly, neural) to the cognitive (Lieberman, 2000; Jung-Beeman et al., 2004; Luu et al 2010) suggests that pre-existing expertise, which requires years of practice to attain (Dreyfus &amp; Dreyfus, 1980; Ericsson et al, 1993) may not be a key requirement for intuitive decision making processes. These studies, and others, suggest that intuitive decision making processes share some of the same underlying neural structures and cognitive processes as a type of learning known as implicit learning (Frensch, 2003; Lieberman, 2000, 20007; Kaufman et al, 2010). Consequently, by acquiring domain knowledge through implicit learning, one may be able to automatically strengthen, at the neural, cognitive and behavioral levels, the same capabilities that are needed for effective intuitive decision making.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Objectives: <br /></span>The objective of this proposed topic is to build a deeper understanding of the neural, cognitive and behavioral processes underlying intuitive decision making, in order to train non-experts to be more effective decision makers. The expected outcomes of this project will include a characterization of how intuition works; a computational model representing these findings; and, training techniques &amp; technologies that enhance intuitive decision making performance. It is expected that these results will lay a scientific foundation for understanding intuitive decision making that will support Cyberwarfare, Unmanned System Operators, Information Analysts, Small Unit Leaders and other domains that require individuals to process and make sense of large volumes of information in time constrained or information-degraded conditions. As well, this effort will establish a technical basis from which to develop new classes of applications that support selection, training, decision aiding and interface design. The Enhancing Intuitive Decision Making Through Implicit Learning Basic Research Challenge will provide the right blend of incentive, risk and benefit to revolutionize the state of the art in improving decision making. Successful proposals will focus on developing innovative, scalable, and affordable technologies that blend the best measurement technologies and modeling approaches with scenario/simulation based training solutions to enable cost effective dissemination of these technologies to a wide range of users.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Research Areas: <br /></span>The primary hypothesis underlying this topic is that implicit learning facilitates intuitive decision making. Testing this hypothesis requires advances in specific research areas that include: <br />1) Characterizing intuitive decision making and implicit learning across neural, cognitive and behavioral levels of representation. There is a range of measurement techniques available to do this. It is expected that proposers to this effort will leverage and extend these wherever possible, to ensure that the resultant data are of sufficient quality to develop effective models; <br />2) Representing intuitive decision making through cognitive models in order to guide implicit learning techniques. Based in large part on advances in understanding of the human brain AND advances in machine learning techniques, it is possible to develop representations of cognition that can represent individual differences, adapt to new contexts and information and that can be modified based on other physiological features like stress and fatigue (Mitchell et al 2004; Shinkareva et al 2008). These new techniques enable a greater ability to represent an individual's current &lsquo;state' and forecast future &lsquo;states' in order to anticipate and tailor to the individual's specific needs; <br />3) Applying simulation / scenario based techniques to develop implicit learning approaches that enhance intuitive decision making. Simulation based training provides a flexible environment for both delivering training and for collecting a range of performance measures (OSer et al, 1999). The scenario based training approach provides a validated process for identifying training requirements, developing the scenario(s) to support these requirements and establishing metrics and techniques for analyzing and assessing trainee performance. There are numerous training simulations available that represent domains in which effective intuitive decision making is critical (e.g. IED detection; Social interaction training; Intelligence analysis; etc) and it is expected that existing systems will be leveraged and extended rather than new ones being developed for this effort;<br />4) Testing and validating the hypothesis that implicit learning facilitates intuitive decision making. This includes comparing neural, cognitive and behavioral performance measures across different conditions. Successful validation plans will include approaches capable of demonstrating that: the neural structures that are active during implicit learning are also active during intuition; that in the absence of implicit learning there are different / distinct patterns of neural activity during an intuitive decision making task; that in control tasks in which neither implicit learning was provided or intuitive decision making required, these structures are minimally active; and, that under those conditions in which implicit learning was provided and intuitive decision making was present, there is a significant improvement in decision making compared to other conditions - for example, as represented by a receiver operator characteristic curve. Specific measures and assessment approaches are left to the proposer but must include approaches that will cut across multiple representation levels and provide a means for distinguishing the effects of implicit learning on intuitive making, if such are present, from other conditions. <br />The Enhancing Intuitive Decision Making Through Implicit Learning Basic Research Challenge will proceed as a four year effort encompassing the above research areas. It is anticipated that addressing each of these research areas will require a multi-year effort to complete and that performance on each research area may overlap in time. Teaming is encouraged within and across research areas. Decomposing each research area into subareas (e.g, breaking up research area 1 into a neural, a cognitive and a behavioral task), each of which is covered by different team members is acceptable if reasonably justified and supported by a clear management / team coordination plan.
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />III. WHITE PAPER SUBMISSION <br /></span></strong>White papers should not exceed 6 single-sided pages, exclusive of cover page and resume of principal investigator, and should be in 12-point Times New Roman font with margins not less than one inch. The cover page should be labeled "White Paper for BASIC RESEARCH CHALLENGE - ENHANCING INTUITIVE DECISION MAKING THROUGH IMPLICIT LEARNING" and include the following information: title of the proposed effort, technical point of contact, telephone number, fax numbers, and e-mail address. The 6-page body of the white paper should include the following information: (1) Principal Investigator; (2) Relevance of the proposed effort to the research areas described in Section II; (3) Technical objective of the proposed effort; (4) Technical approach that will be pursued to meet the objective; (5) A summary of recent relevant technical breakthroughs; and (6) A program management plan that includes a high level timeline for proposed tasks, indicates proposed team members who will be accomplishing those tasks and a funding plan showing requested funding per fiscal year. A resume of the principal investigator, not to exceed 1 page, should also be included after the 6-page body of the white paper. <br />White papers are required for all offerors seeking funding. Each white paper will be evaluated by the Government to determine whether the technology advancement proposed appears to be of particular value to the Department of the Navy. Only the authors of white papers that appear to be of particular value to the Department of the Navy will be invited to submit full proposals. Initial Government evaluations and feedback will be issued via e-mail notification from the Technical Points of Contact. <br />Detailed Full Proposal (Technical and Cost volumes) will be subsequently encouraged from those offerors whose proposed technologies have been identified through the above referenced e-mail as being of "particular value" to the Government. However, any such encouragement does not assure a subsequent award. <br />For white papers that propose efforts that are considered of particular value to the Navy but either exceed available budgets or contain certain tasks or applications that are not desired by the Navy, ONR may suggest a full proposal with reduced effort to fit within expected available budgets or an effort that refocuses the tasks or application of the technology to maximize the benefit to the Navy. <br />White papers should be submitted electronically to the business point of contact whose e-mail address appears at the end of this Special Notice. These white papers shall be in Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF format. <br />To ensure full, timely consideration for funding, white papers should be submitted no later than 15 April 2012. White Papers received after that date will be considered as time and availability of funding permit.<br />The planned date for completing the review of white papers is on or about&nbsp;01 June 2012. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">IV. FULL PROPOSAL SUBMISSION AND AWARD INFORMATION <br /></span></strong>Full proposals (including one technical volume and one cost volume) should be submitted under ONR BAA 12-001 by 15 July 2012.

<p>FROM: 673 CONS/LGCZ 24 Feb 2011</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Request for Small Businesses Comments- Incentives (Suspense COB 3 Mar 11)</p>
<p>1. This is not a request for proposal, but a request for comments from Small Businesses to the attached Installation Support Services (ISS) for Geographically Separated Locations (GSL) Draft Award Term Plan. The contract is targeted for Small Business as a Fixed Price with Incentive Firm (FPIF) and Award Term Options resulting in; a contract witha 6 month Base, four 1 year options and five 1 year Award Term Options. Please review the attached documents and provide comments to the following:</p>
<p>a. Does your company have an adequate accounting system for providing data to support negotiations of an incentive price revision (FAR 16.403-1 (c))?</p>
<p>b. Has your company had a successful Accounting System Survey audit conducted by the DCAA for past awarded contracts?</p>
<p>c. Would this contract incentive preclude your company from proposing? If it would, why?</p>
<p>d. Is a ceiling price (Point of Total Assumption) of 5% appropriate for this type of contract risk? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>e. Do you have any other suggested areas for off contract cost reductions?</p>
<p>f. Are the Evaluation Criteria understandable and well defined? Do you have any additional questions and /or need clarification on any parts of the draft Plan?</p>
<p>2. This incentive approach is in response to the DOD's declining funding, changing business practices and is designed to control and lower cost. The incentive plan for this contract consist of two parts: 1) Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) and 2) Award Terms (AT) for additional five option years. Both require performance standards to be met. The FPIF is designed to provide a positive, calculable profit incentive for the contractor to control costs on an annual basis. The AT targets the reduction of three off contract costs that are within the contractor's control.</p>
<p>3. For additional information about FPIF please refer to FAR 52.216-16 and FAR 16.403-1.</p>
<p>4. Your input is vital to the government's market research of this topic. Please provide responses as soon as possible, but no later than your close of business Thursday, 3 Mar 2011 to both margaret.zerbach@elmendorf.af.mil and stuart.mcelhinney@elemendorf.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>The services include lodging rooms for attending conferees (Soldiers, Family Members, retirees and DA Civilians), meeting and reception rooms, audio/visual equipment, security and refreshments.  This requirement executes the HQDA Army Family Action Plan (AFAP) conference and two General Officer Steering Committee meetings.  AFAP allows senior leaders to determine if improvements and investments in programs meet the needs of Soldiers and Families by gathering first-hand information from those most affected by the changes in the Army to include deployments and the restructuring of the Army.  Many of the attendees are junior enlisted or junior officers', surviving family members, retirees and spouses from around the world who do not possess government travel cards or personal credit cards and many do not have the financial ability to absorb the costs associated with the lodging and meals in the National Capital Region.

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1(c)
<ARCHDATE>03162012
<DESC>In accordance with FAR 11.105 (a) (3), the following brand name justification is hereby provided for public disemination.
<p>NOTE: This requirement will be competed under the&nbsp;National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC),&nbsp;Groups A, B, C, and D. Only prime vendors under Groups A, B, C, and D of the NASA SEWP GWAC Contract will be given a fair opportunity to compete.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br />41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1)</p>
<p><br />Pursuant to the requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA), as implemented by FAR Subpart 6.3, and in accordance with the requirements of FAR 6.303-1, the justification for the use of the statutory authority under FAR Subpart 6.3 is justified by the following facts and rationale required under FAR 6.303-2 as follows:</p>
<p><br />1. AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY</p>
<p>The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), Office of Budget and Financial Management (OBFM), proposes to enter into a contract on the basis other than full and open competition for a brand name purchase.</p>
<p>2. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED</p>
<p>FHFA has a requirement to procure brand name Cisco network and telecommunication hardware, software, and services to expand and refresh components within FHFA's enterprise network infrastructure located within the Government Sponsored Enterprises (Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae). The estimated cost is REDACTED.</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF EQUIPMENT</p>
<p>FHFA will purchase network and telecommunication products that will include:</p>
<p>2 each Cisco Catalyst 4500 E-Series Switches w/ interface modules<br />70 each Cisco 9971 Unified IP Phones with cameras</p>
<p>The resultant order will also include all required modules, service contracts, and licensing to support the above products.</p>
<p>4. IDENTIFICATION OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."</p>
<p>5. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED</p>
<p>The following key points are some of the considerations in justifying the acquisition of Cisco solutions:</p>
<p>&bull; FHFA's current network infrastructure is based on Cisco products. Because of the concerns that incompatible equipment might introduce significant risks into the FHFA production environment, FHFA would need to acquire additional equipment to duplicate our existing production environment before proceeding with interoperability testing. In addition to the substantial cost of acquiring this equipment, this testing would require significant effort from FHFA network engineers and would result in the delay of multiple critical initiatives.</p>
<p>&bull; All of the FHFA network staff are experienced Cisco network engineers. FHFA has a significant investment in staff training and certifications, resulting in experience installing, operating, administering, and maintaining Cisco equipment. Introduction of non-Cisco brand networking components would require significant retraining and recertification.</p>
<p>&bull; In addition, introduction of non-FHFA standard networking components (other than Cisco equipment) would conflict with the FHFA Enterprise Architecture. Likewise, deviation from the use of FHFA established networking technology would cause the need for recertification of the FHFA General Support System (GSS). Recertification would result in added costs and would negatively impact the agency's data center consolidation initiative.</p>
<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) provides a broad base of vendors that can compete for award of the required Cisco network and telecommunication hardware, software, and services.</p>
<p>6. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS IS PRACTICAL</p>
<p>A solicitation will be sent to thirty-eight (38) vendors under the NASA SEWP Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. This contract vehicle has already been synopsized in accordance with FAR 5.201.</p>
<p>7. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer determines that the anticipated price will be fair and reasonable by obtaining competition among the NASA SEWP vendors.</p>
<p>8. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED<br /><br />The Office of Technology and Information Management (OTIM) performed web-based market research to determine and validate pricing and best delivery for the equipment. FHFA believes that award to any other brand would result in substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition and would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling agency objectives. The market research concluded that the requirements could be fulfilled by soliciting from the NASA SEWP IDIQ contract. These vendors appear to be capable of providing Cisco network and telecommunication products including all required modules, operating systems and service to support the products.</p>
<p>9. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>To maintain network infrastructure continuity at FHFA, Cisco equipment is required; adding network equipment from different manufacturers will introduce additional operational and maintenance requirements for the staff supporting the equipment as well as increased manufacturer cross compatibility risks. Introduction of another vendor's product would also require a second network management platform to properly monitor the different manufacturer's equipment.</p>
<p>10. A LISTING OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT HAVE EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN THIS ACQUISITION</p>
<p>Thirty-eight vendors under the NASA SEWP IDIQ contract will be given the opportunity to submit a quote.</p>
<p>11. A STATEMENT OF ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO EITHER REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION</p>
<p>Based on the justification presented above, there is no plan to consider the use of any other equipment for replacement purposes other than CISCO. This standard is anticipated to be used in future similar requirements.</p>
<p>12. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION</p>
<p>I certify that the data supporting the recommended use of other than full and open competition is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>

<p><br />13. TECHNICAL/REQUIREMENTS PERSONNEL CERTIFICATION:</p>
<p>I certify this requirement meets the Government's minimum need and that the supporting data, which forms a basis for this justification, is complete and accurate.</p>
