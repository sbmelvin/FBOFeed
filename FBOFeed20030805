<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Telonics, Inc932 East Impala, Mesa, AZ  85204.  The proposed contract is for TGW-3580-GPS Collar Store-on-Board Unit with ARGOS uplink.  VHF Beacon, MS6 Mortality Motion Sensor, Standard Collar, CR-2A Breakaway Collar Release and Cast-4 Protective Casting.  Telonics Inc. builds this particular type of GPS collar specifically for use on bighorn sheep.  The collars have a unique satellite-uplink feature that will allow immediate access to the location data (verses a two-year wait until end of the study when information can be downloaded from the collar).  This is a critical feature for the study.  Equipment compatibility is critical for the success of this project.  Other manufacturers make telemetry equipment, but compatibility with equipment from another vendor is uncertain.  Using another vendor would result in having to purchase new receivers.  An important and unique feature of this telemetry equipment is that all memories used to store data on board the system are totally nonvolatile and do not require any battery backup, ensuring that the data are secure even after years of storage.  Teleonics equiipment has tested reliability and durability; transmitters rated as lasting 2 years frequently last up to six months longer than anticipated.  Equipment failure is unusual. THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Information will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Determination to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government; no additional synopsis will be published.

<DESC>The solicitation for this announcement will be available at http://ideasec.nbc.gov on or about August 18, 2003.  PAPER COPIES OF THE SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND TELEPHONE REQUESTS OR FAX REQUESTS FOR THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  HOWEVER, SEE LAST PARAGRAPH OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT FOR EXCEPTION.  Description:  This is a full and open competition.  Corporate Business Advisory Services for the National Concessions Program Office, Washington, D.C.  The National Park Service (NPS), Washington Contracts and Procurement Office (WCP), intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to solicit proposals to provide Corporate Business Advisory Services to the NPS National Concession Program.  This will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Task Order contract in support of the National Concessions Program Office in Washington, D.C.  The Government plans to award one (1) task order contract (although it reserves the right to award contracts to more than one source under this solicitation).  The Government reserves the right to award a contract(s), based on the selection board's final selection, to the firm(s) considered most highly qualified to perform the work.  Should more than one contract be awarded, each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for task orders to be issued.  Contract Period:  All services will be provided under an Indefinite Quantity contract. The base contract period will be for one year, with options to extend for four additional one-year periods. Work will be ordered by issuance of firm-fixed-price or not-to-exceed, time-and-material, type task orders. The maximum ordering limitation will be $300,000.000 per task order and $2,000,000.00 per year, for a total of $10,000,000.00 for the life of the contract.   The guaranteed minimum for the life of the contract, which includes the base period and all options exercised, is $25,000.00.  Primary Services include, but are not limited to, business advisory support, advice on matters related to providing hospitality services to the public, identifying sources of industry expertise in certain specialized operations, business process reengineering services, strategic planning, and other business related support services.  All work shall be performed in a manner consistent with Federal and State laws and regulations governing the work performed.  Job Requirements:  The contractor shall have the capability and experience to perform, or provide, a wide range of services related to the provision of business advice in the hospitality industry including, but not limited to, a good understanding, knowledge, and application of business and financial management principles and practices; the hospitality industry; leasing and lease-hold interests and Federal Government concession contracting; as well as broad experience in all phases of financial analysis, strategic planning and project management.  Required Expertise includes:  Senior-level business, government-affairs, financial, strategic planning, hospitality industry and business process reengineering expertise, information technology/database development, and technical writing.  Firms must be able to provide all necessary disciplines by in-house personnel or through the use of subcontractors. Project Managers must have experience managing the types of projects anticipated by this solicitation.  Firms will be evaluated by a selection committee based upon the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance (to be further described in the RFP): (1) Management Capability - defined by the professional qualifications of the firm and staff (both prime contractor and subcontractors) proposed for the performance of the services as set forth above and submission of a management strategy. (2) Technical Excellence - defined by the specialized and technical experience and knowledge of the services set forth above. (3) Past Performance - defined by the prime's, as well as the team's, prior performance on Government and private sector contracts for related or similar work.  In addition to other factors, offers will be evaluated on the basis of advantages and disadvantages to the Government that might result from making more than one award (i.e., multiple awards). All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.  Subcontracting Plan Requirement:  In accordance with Public Law 97-507, the firm will be required to provide the maximum practicable opportunities for small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. The selected firm, if a large business, must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract. The subcontracting goals will be set forth in the RFP. The subcontracting plan is not required with submittal of the proposal; however, contract award is contingent upon negotiation of an acceptable subcontracting plan.  The NAICS Code for this work is 541219 and the small business size standard is $6,000,000.00.  This procurement is based upon Best-Value and is subject to the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.   The complete RFP for Solicitation D262303D152 will be published electronically on or about August 18, 2003.  Responses will be due approximately 30 days following issuance of the RFP.

<DESC>NA The mission of the Center for Countermeasures (CCM) located at White Sands Missile Range, NM is to advance scientific and technical knowledge as related to weapon systems employing electro-optical (EO)/infrared (IR) and millimeter wave (MMW) technologies.  In accomplishing this mission, CCM requires contracted research, engineering and analysis support to perform countermeasures/counter-countermeasures (CM/CCM) test and analysis activities on all precision-guided weapon systems, subsystems and related compo nents.  CCM has recently expanded their mission into warfighter components dealing with CM.  Efforts in support of these activities include advancement of information and training.  A Venn diagram explaining the relationships involved in this support can b e accessed at  http://www.wsmr.army.mil/docpage/pages/sol_stat.htm.  This action is being conducted as full and open competition in accordance with FAR Part 35 - Research and Development Contracting.  The NAICS code assigned is 541710 and has a size standa rd of 500 employees.  As prescribed by FAR 35 selection will be conducted in a two-step process.  The first step will be to perform a pre-qualifying evaluation.  Selection will involve a determination by the Government of the overall qualifications of each  potential source as  evaluated in terms of the following evaluation factors.  1. Past performance in one or more relevant fields (submit name, address, and telephone number of at least three previous customers).   2.  Professional recognition and relevant  experience (provide us with articles or other recognition that you have received and an applicable bibliography/publication list).  3.  Ability to acquire and retain the professional and technical personnel considered outstanding in their fields (provide us resumes of your key professional and technical personnel in your fields of expertise).  4.  Since most of this work is classified, a top-secret facility clearance is required with individual clearances (provide evidence of current or previous clearances ).  Contractors involved in the development of weapon systems or their components as described above shall not be considered for award.  We will select the best-qualified sources as a result of this synopsis in accordance with the listed evaluation factors .  These sources will be allowed to continue in the competition to select the awardee for the required support.  The ultimate goal is to award a contract to support CCM in this R&D program.  The final award will be made prior to November 2003 with full per formance to begin 21 November 2003.  The contract will consist of firm-fixed price line items for a core group of onsite support and a cost-reimbursable line item for travel and other unforeseeable costs and a line for assignment of task orders.  The award  term provisions will allow the potential term of the contract to be 15 years.  The contract will consist of an initial 1-year base period and 2 one-year options.  There will be an additional 12 options that must be earned through performance.  In the 2nd year you can earn the 4th year by achieving a rating of VERY GOOD.  In the 3rd year you can earn the 5th year with a rating of VERY GOOD.  After that you must achieve a rating of EXCELLENT to earn options.  All responses to this synopsis shall be submitted  electronically to martineznm@wsmr.army.mil no later than 2:00 pm MDT on 18 August 2003.

<DESC>BILLINGSLEY TFM10K HIGH FIELD TRI-AXIAL MAGNETOMETER:  The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station, Panama City, Florida (NSWCDDCSS), intends to award a sole-source firm-fixed price purchase order to Billingsly Instrumentation, Inc. (doing business as Billingsly Magnetics) of Brookeville, MD for seven (7) Billingsley TFM10K High Field Tri-axial Magnetometer with a range of +/- 10 Gauss that will be used to collect magnetic data from Magnetic signature duplicator systems.  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons: The technical data required to develop these magnetometers is proprietary to Billingsly Magnetics and the magnetometers must be fully compatible with the magnetic systems currently used by the Coastal Test Range to provide a redundancy in hardware.  These systems were originally developed usin g Billingsly magnetometers. It is imperative that the equipment purchased for this upgrade be 100% compatible and easily integrated with the existing hardware and software.  This level of compatibility and integration are required to prevent data loss during test operations that would be extremely expensive and difficult to recreate.  Use of any other equipment would require additional time to integrate, test for compatibility, and require training of Test Range personnel in its operation which would negatively impact the test range schedule. The Billingsly magnetometers are considered to be the only acceptable option because of the above reasons.  NAICS Code is 334419, Size Standard is 500 Employees.

Section 2801 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, Public Law 104-106, 110 Stat. 186 (10 USC 2871-2885), as amended by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2001, 2002 and 2003, provides a series of powerful authorities that allow the Department of Defense (DOD) to work with the private sector to build and renovate family housing and ancillary facilities.  The Department of the Navy (DON) intends to utilize the unique powers and authorities provided under the legislation to ensure that safe, high quality, energy efficient, well-managed, affordable housing will be available to military families, as needed, over the long term at NAS Brunswick, NSY Portsmouth, NAVSTA Newport, NSB New London, NSU Saratoga Springs, NWS Earle, and NAES Lakehurst.  Accordingly, the DON intends to become a partner in a public-private partnership, or similar business entity, established by a private company or team of private investors/developers, property managers/operators, building contractors, architects and engineers, and/or others for housing for military families at the aforementioned installations.  The DON intends to contribute 5,215 existing homes of DON-owned and DON-occupied family housing and two mobile home parks including related improvements, support facilities and land to the partnership for the planned demolition of 562 homes; the design, finance and construction of 321 replacement homes and up to 27 new homes, with related site amenities on DON-provided land; and, renovation of up to 1,933 existing homes for an end state maximum of 4,210 homes.  Through the partnership, the DON intends to market and sell the following existing homes, land and housing related facilities: 28 homes and land in Fairfield, CT; 20 homes and land at Rainbow Heights, NAVSTA Newport, RI; 125 homes and land at Fort Adams, NAVSTA Newport, RI; 510 homes and land at Mitchel Complex (Field & Manor), NY; and 40 homes and land at Green Acres, NWS Earle, NJ; and, 3 homes and land at Highway 34, NWS Earle, NJ for a total of 726 homes, in a manner that maximizes the sales proceeds and offers the greatest value to the project.  The DON envisions the private partner (managing member) securing debt and/or contributing equity, as needed, over the long term to carry out the project. Acting on behalf of the partnership, the private partner will own, operate, manage and maintain the existing inventory of DON-owned family housing units and any new and replacement units constructed, including site infrastructure and ancillary facilities, for a term of 50 years.  In addition, the partnership will own, operate, manage and maintain 31 market homes (12 at NSY Portsmouth and 19 at NAVSTA Newport) including streets and selected infrastructure.

<P>(*) All missing attachments will be posted to the NARA ERA Acquisition web 
site prior to final release of the RFP. </P>
<P>The ERA system will authentically preserve and provide access to any kind of 
electronic record, free from dependency on any specific hardware or software, 
enabling NARA to carry out its mission into the future. To do this, ideally the 
system would be able to take any type of record, from any entity in the Federal 
Government, created using any type of application, on any computing platform, 
and provide discovery and delivery to anyone with an interest and legal right of 
access, now and for the life of the republic. Detailed background information on 
the ERA program is available at the ERA web site, <A 
href="http://www.archives.gov/electronic_records_archives">http://www.archives.gov/electronic_records_archives</A>.</P>
<P>Based on industry comments, the ERA business and contracting approach has 
been revised to a full-and-open hybrid Firm Fixed Price (FFP)/Cost Plus Award 
Fee (CPAF) competition. The solicitation will be for an initial one (1) year FFP 
base contract period and six (6) CPAF option periods. NARA’s acquisition 
approach is to initially award one or more contracts using a best value 
competition. During the initial System Analysis and Design phase (base contract 
period) the selected contractors each will produce a detailed System 
Requirements Specification and System Design Document. In the event that 
multiple contracts are awarded there will be a down select to a single 
contractor at the end of the base contract period. The selected contractor will 
perform development and deployment of the ERA on an incremental basis. The 
initial option period (increment 1) will be for two (2) years, and the remaining 
option periods (increments 2-5 and a final year of operations and support) will 
be for one (1) year each. </P>
<P>The Government may exercise optional CPAF CLINS for Operations and Support 
(O&S) of the system. The sixth one-year option period will be only for 
O&S of the system as delivered at the end of the fifth increment. This 
represents a change in previously published acquisition strategy in that the 
Government now plans to acquire O&S as part of this ERA acquisition 
contract.</P>
<P>The Draft ERA RFP will only be available by downloading from the ERA 
Acquisition web site at </P>

</P>
<P>Your meaningful comments on this Draft Request for Proposal will be 
appreciated. You are encouraged to serially submit questions or comments as they 
become available. Each comment addressing a specific item in the Draft RFP 
should reference the section and paragraph number. Any comments not addressing a 
specific item in the draft should be marked as General. In order for responses 
to receive full consideration, they should be received by September 17, 2003 at 
5 PM EST. Responses must be submitted electronically to the following email 
address: <A href="mailto:ERA.Acquisition@nara.gov">ERA.Acquisition@nara.gov</A> 
. Responses must be in Microsoft Word format. Please include company name, point 
of contact, mailing address, phone number, and email address.<BR><BR><B>DO NOT 
RESPOND TO THE FEDBIZOPS POINT OF CONTACT.</P></B>
<P>NARA intends to answer as many questions and comments as are deemed 
appropriate. The Government will consider all questions and comments received 
from potential Offerors in preparation of the final RFP. Any changes made will 
be at the sole discretion of the ERA Program Office. </P>
<P>This Draft RFP shall not be construed as an obligation on the part of the 
Government to acquire any products or services, and it does not restrict the 
Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. Proposals are not requested 
at this time and will not be considered. Any information provided to the 
Government is strictly voluntary and at no cost to the Government. The 
Government will not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with 
submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred by 
interested parties for responses to this Draft RFP. No entitlement to payment of 
direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of 
submission of responses to this Draft RFP and the Government’s use of such 
information. </P>
<P>A final solicitation will be published prior to the end of the 1st quarter FY 
04 with an award being made prior to the end of the 3rd Quarter FY 04.</P>
<P>Please check the NARA ERA Acquisition Web Site Daily for new or updated 
information.</P>
<P>Thank you for your continued interest in the ERA program.</P></BODY></HTML>

This cost proposal will be compared with the Government’s costs to perform the above services.  This proposal will not result in a contract if Government Performance is determined to be more cost advantageous.  Government personnel are currently providing these services.  Major components of this work include: preparing conservation plans in accordance with the National Planning Procedures Handbook, the Field Office Technical Guide, and all associated manuals and handbooks to meet landowner objectives and address natural resource concerns; help landowners apply for USDA and other federal, state and local cost-share programs and process those applications; work cooperatively with local NRCS field office staff, local Resource Conservation District staff, tribes and other federal, state and local partner agencies; work with landowners to perform field investigations, survey, design, layout, and inspection construction of conservation practices; provide follow-up of existing contracts with landowners; and document practice application according to NRCS policies and procedures. Duties also include assisting with conducting public education and information activities such as tours, public speaking, and writing news releases as necessary. Any contract resulting from this solicitation will have a one-year base period and four one-year options. This solicitation is being solicited unrestricted. NAICS Code: 541990, All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services; size standard $6.0 million.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 562219   The EPA is conducting another market survey through this FedBizOpps notification to identify small businesses that have the capability to provide recycling, reclamation, and asset disposition services for a variety of electronics equipment; including:  personal computer desktops, laptops, printers, scanners, LAN equipment, copying machines, phones, palm pilots, cell phones, etc.  EPA is currently in the process of fulfilling an Agency requirement for the recycling of electronic equipment and properly disposing of Agency electronic assets as part of its ongoing  mission to protect the environment.  In order to enhance public health and environmental protection, EPA plans to award multiple contracts entitled Recycling Electronics and Asset Disposition (READ) services which will provide the entire Federal sector with a procurement tool to recycle and  properly dispose of excess or obsolete electronic personal property in an environmentally responsible manner.  More information about the initiative can be found under the READ icon at http://www.epa.gov/oam/hpod In order to determine whether this requirement can be completely set-aside for small  business, we are in the process of analyzing whether the capability exists in the small business community.  This requirement goes beyond basic electronic recycling.  If you are a small business, please respond to clarify whether or not you have the capability, or can partner with an organization  who has the capability, to perform the following functions:  (1) Refurbishing and reconfiguring electronic equipment and identifying a market to resell that equipment; (2) Creating an audit trail that can track equipment's final destination for reporting purposes and providing certification  regarding the final disposition of all electronic equipment handled by your company, (3) Providing logistical support for nationwide coverage for federal agency's who have several regional/field offices; (4) Ensuring the security of information contained in the equipment and preventing sensitive  information from being compromised; and (5) Dismantling electronic equipment that has been determined to be beyond an upgrade or refurbishment.  Reclamation of  this type of equipment will involve having the ability to identify which parts can be recycled for possible use in other equipment, which  parts can be resold on the market, and which parts have no useful market value and must be properly disposed or recycled.  If your company can fulfill these requirements, please provide substantiating information. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this  requirement may be 562920, Material Recovery Facilities, 562211, Hazardous Waste Treatment and Disposal, and/or 562219, Other Non-hazardous Waste Treatment and Disposal.  All of these codes have a small business standard of $10.5M in annual receipts.  Annual receipts are defined as the average  gross receipts over a firm's latest 3 completed fiscal years.  "Receipts" means the firm's gross or total income, plus cost of goods sold, as defined by or reported on the firm's Federal Income Tax  return.  The term does not include, however, net capital gains or losses, nor taxes collected for  and remitted to a taxing authority if included in gross or total income.  A complete definition of all Small Business Administration (SBA) small business size standards can be found at http://www.sba.gov/size/indexguide.html . If your company has the capability to provide these services and is  considered a small business as described above, please submit a written notification to voss.oliver@epa.gov.

NASA/ARC intends to purchase the test models from Applied Research Associates, Albuquerque, NM 87110, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) based on the fact that the models are proprietary products of Applied Research Associates, thus they are the only qualified supplier for these materials. NASA/ARC will procure twenty-four arc-jet test samples made from the following charring ablators: SRAM-20, SRAM-17, SRAM-14, and PhenCarb-20 (six samples each). In addition, NASA/ARC requires four flat panels, one of each material, for laboratory testing.  Arc-jet samples will be 3.0-in. diameter flat samples, with an aluminum disc substrate, and will be fully instrumented, fully assembled, weighed, measured, photographed, and fully ready for thermal testing. Flat panels will be 6.0-in. by 6.0-in. by 1.0 in., uninstrumented and without composite reinforcement.

Aluminum-disc substrate, 0.050-in. thickness (5052 or similar). 3.      RTV-560 ablator bondline with 0.010-in. thickness. 4.   Two bondline thermocouples, 30 gauge Type-K, with 36-in. lead wires. 5. Thermocouple junction electrically isolated from aluminum. 6.   Spacing between T/C junctions within bondline of 0.75 in. 7.    Ablators to have a common areal weight of 0.325 g/cm2, tolerance +/- 2%. 8.     With an area of 45.6 cm2, ablator weights to be 14.8 g, +/- 0.3 g. 9.   SRAM-20 ablator thickness approx. 0.400 in. 10. SRAM-17 ablator thickness approx. 0.471 in. 11. SRAM-14 ablator thickness approx. 0.571 in. 12. PhenCarb-20 ablator thickness approx. 0.400 in. Option: NASA/ARC may supply its own substrate and thermocouples.  All materials and test samples must be delivered to NASA/ARC by September 12, 2003. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:30 p.m. Pacific time on August 20, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>POC:  Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209.  Tel: 703-875-4357; Fax: 703-875-4009; email: ekunene@tda.gov.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Dragan Solak, General Manager, Serbia Broadband- Srpske Kablovske Mreze d.o.o., ul. Kralja Petra 45, 6th floor, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia, Serbia & Montenegro, Phone: +381-11-631-125, Fax: +381 11 186 041. The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the installation of a nation-wide fiber-optic backbone infrastructure in Serbia.

At present, Serbia Broadband (SBB), the Grantee, does not have a wide-area fiber-optic transmission infrastructure to link its headends in the various cities and towns.  Instead SBB leases telecommunications links between its various headends.  This means that SBB does not yet possess its own high bandwidth (throughput) system for delivering telecom services to its various disparate systems.  SBB believes that the development of such a nation-wide backbone network could be the next logical step in expanding its reach and unifying and consolidating its operations, and also in positioning the company to offer telecoms/media services (either directly to end users or as a “wholesaler” or “carrier’s carrier”) on a nation-wide scale, particularly after market liberalization in mid-2005.  SBB has been in discussions with providers of alternative infrastructure (e.g. electric and gas-pipeline utilities, railways) regarding the development of their Rights of Way (ROW) for this purpose.  

SBB also believes that availability of a nation-wide backbone network would yield benefits in terms of the internal operations and administration of the company (e.g., by enabling better inventory management, and hence responsiveness to customers; reducing costs of implementing Call Centers, etc.).  With the availability of relatively inexpensive (compared to leased lines) and larger capacity for internal uses, the company will be able to share information in real time to allow for better management and customer response.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $325,936 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, SEPTEMBER 15, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals

<DESC>REQUEST FOR EXPRESSION OF INTEREST – REMOTE-HANDLED TRANSURANIC (TRU) WASTE CHARACTERIZATION AND PREPARATION AT THE IDAHO NATIONAL ENGINEERING AND ENVIRONMENTAL LABORATORY

I.	INTRODUCTION –Bechtel, BWXT Idaho LLC (BBWI), Management & Operating Contractor of the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), is requesting an expression of interest from prospective Vendors to provide equipment and services to characterize and prepare remote-handled (RH) TRU waste for transport to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP).  BBWI is interested in discussing technical capabilities along with recommended contracting mechanisms to provide drum venting, headspace gas sampling and analysis, radiography, radio-assay, visual examination, repackaging, and payload assembly and loading of RH TRU waste in accordance with WIPP requirements (currently in draft form).  This expression of interest shall serve only as a method of establishing technical capabilities and commercial interest.  Qualified candidates may be invited to participate in follow-on technical/business discussions.  

II.	BACKGROUND - The INEEL is a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Laboratory located approximately 50 miles from Idaho Falls, Idaho.  Alternatives are actively being pursued in search of a cost-effective solution to processing INEEL’s small volume of stored RH TRU waste (approximately 1,500 drums). Various contracting options may be available depending on value to the Government.  It is expected, based on draft WIPP Waste Acceptance Criteria and Waste Analysis Plan requirements for RH TRU waste, that a portion of the inventory will not require repackaging or intrusive characterization.  It is also expected that the remaining inventory will require repackaging or intrusive characterization prior to shipment to the WIPP.   Expected non-intrusive characterization capabilities include non-destructive assay, and non-destructive examination.  Expected intrusive characterization capabilities include drum venting, headspace gas sampling, visual examination, and repackaging.  Transportation systems include payload assembly, loading, and shipping utilizing the CNS 10-160B and RH 72-B casks.  

III.	SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS - Prospective candidates shall provide a written response to address the following:

1)A description of current knowledge or capabilities related to performing the anticipated work.
2)A sample listing  of current and past clients with a working knowledge of your firm’s capabilities in this area of expertise.
3)Experience working under a WIPP-certified characterization and/or transportation program
4)Existing or planned capabilities  applicable to RH TRU waste characterization, certification, and transportation to include -
·Quality assurance program
·Drum venting
·Headspace gas sampling and analysis
·Non-destructive examination (radiography)
·Non-destructive radio-assay
·Visual examination and repackaging
·Payload assembly and shipping
5)The name, phone and email of a representative of your firm

Please provide your expression of interest to Robert T. Crowton by Close-of Business, August 31,2003.  If you have questions or need additional information, please contact Robert T. Crowton on Extension (208) 526-7746 or email rtc@inel.gov.  Technical questions must be submitted in writing (U.S. Mail or email).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

This RFI is an attempt to locate businesses EXPERIENCED in formal course re-engineering and capable of re-engineering Air Force formal training courses to reduce training time and expenditures.  This RFI is not to be construed as a formal solicitation nor does it constitute a current or any future Government requirement. Any information provided to the Government is strictly voluntary and at no cost to the Government. Any formal solicitation will be announced separately. The Air Force is only interested at this point in determining industry capability for the contemplated services. To this end, private sector industry is invited to submit experience, capability and cost information demonstrating the ability to meet the requirements below.  Request responses be provided NLT 16 Jul 03             

Period of Performance. TBD

Phase II  (Option) -- Audit of selected course(s) and development of a re-engineering plan.

Phase III (Option) -- Development of re-engineered course materials, teaching of the re-engineered course(s), and demonstration that the re-engineering process provides the expected results.

Phase IV (Option) -- Providing U.S. Air Force training managers, course developers, and instructors with the skills required to implement the proven re-engineering concepts and processes within the Air Force formal training environment.

<DESC>AMENDED TO CHANGE HERBICIDE REQUIREMENTS. (THIS SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION REPLACES ALL THE PREVIOUS SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION)

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemental and additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be used.  This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation number is RFQ-R8-03-16.  The solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-17.  The applicable Standard Industrial Classification 325320 and size standard is 500 employees.  The USDA, Forest Services is soliciting for the acquisition of the following herbicides/pesticides:  Item 1a – Glyphosate 4#/gallon (no surfactant) 2.5 gallon container (2 per box) 600 gallons OR Item 1b – Glyphosate 5.4#/gallon (no surfactant) 2.5 gallon container (2 per box) 450 gallons OR Item 1c - a mix of the 2 formulations yielding the equivalent poundage of ai.; Item 2 – Velpar L (product specific; no substitutions) 2.5 gallon container (2 per box), 1500 gallons; Item 3 – Arsenal Applicators Concentrate (Forestry 4 lb ai) (product specific; no substitutions) 1 quart container (4 per box) 100 gallons; Item 4 –Arsenal (2 lb ai) (product specific; no substitutions) 1 quart container (4 per box) 100 gallons; Item 5 – Triclopyr amine in water solution 1000 gallons of 3# a.i. per gallon product or equivalent amount of a.i. (4050 lbs a.i.) in alternative formulation 2.5 gallons container (2 per box) 1000 gallons of 3# a.i. per gallon product or equivalent amount of a.i. (4050 lbs a.i.) in alternative formulation; and Item 6 – Triclopyr ester solution  2.5 gallons container (2 per box) 800 gallons of 4# a.i. per gallon product or equivalent amount of a.i. (4000 lbs a.i.) in alternative formulation.  Products 2-4 are product specific (to meet Environment Protection Agency (EPA) labeling requirements), and package size specific to meet desired storage and use safety standards. While other products or packaging is available it is unacceptable due to either to regulatory or safety constraints.  
 
Products 1a, 1b and lc are equivalent products, calculations reflecting the fact that different formulators package at different rates of active ingredient per gallon.  Either rate per gallon is acceptable if tendered product is labeled for forestry use and the formulation contains no surfactant.  Packaging other than 2 per box is acceptable but 2.5 gallon/container is the maximum volume container acceptable.  Proposed working for the quote would be "Glyphosate as a solution in water without – 2400 lbs ai as either 600 gallons of a 4 lb ai/gallon formulation, 450 gallons of a 5.4 lb ai/gallon formulation, or a combination of the two formulation weights (2.5 gallon containers, 2 per box); must be labeled for forestry use."  Quoters may submit a quote on Items 1a or lb.  (Separate listings are given to allow purchase of existing 4# ai/gallon stock or to procure appropriate 5.4# ai/gallon products).  

Product 5 is formulated triclopyr – amine formulation in water solution. A total of 1350 gallons of the 3# a.i./gallon formulations (traditional formulation = 4050 lbs a.i.) is estimated for need. This may be filled as  3# a.i. gallon formulated product or as the equivalent poundage of a.i. in product formulated at a different rate of a.i./gallon.

Product 6 is formulated triclopyr – ester formulation in appropriate solution (potentially including surfactant). A total of 1000 gallons of the 4# a.i./gallon formulation (traditional formulation = 4000 lbs a.i.) is estimated for need. This may be filled as  4# a.i. gallon formulated product or as the equivalent poundage of a.i. in product formulated at a different rate of a.i./gallon.

Product specific EPA requires that products be labeled for "site" of application.  Any product purchased from proposed contract must have appropriate labeling to permit forest, right-of-way, or wildlife site use.  Quoters must provide products meeting this label constraints or product will be returned at awarding contractor's expense.  
All quantities are estimated.  No obligation will exist until the Government places an order.  Orders will be made by credit card or purchase order.  Quoters must be set-up to received payments by credit card.  Orders against the proposed contract must be delivered to one or combination of the following states:  Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas.  A receipt of all orders placed under the proposed contract must be mailed to the Purchaser and Contracting Officer.  The proposed contract starting time will be on or around July 14, 2003.  Period of performance is one (1) year from date of contract award.  The provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial applies without addenda.  Award will be made to a responsible contractor whose offer is the lowest, acceptable price and most advantageous to the Government.   Award will be made on one or more items.  Offers shall include a complete copy of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items, with quotes.  Under the FAR clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items, applies without any addenda to the clause to this acquisition.  The FAR clause 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  The FAR clause and provisions can be access via Internet at www.arnet.gov/far.html.  Submit written quotations to the USDA, Forest Service, Attn:  Kay Matthews/RFQ-R8-03-16, 1720 Peachtree Road, NW, Room 876S, Atlanta, GA  30309 at COB 06/26/03.  Quotations need to be submitted in an envelope and address properly for identification purposes.  Do not fax your quotations.  No paper solicitation will be issued.

<DESC>Program Research and Develop Announcement (PRDA) 
for Ship Disposal Solutions

Description: THIS MODIFICATION AMENDS THE ORIGINAL PRDA BY PROVIDING AN ADDITIONAL PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PERIOD, FROM March 10, 2003 THROUGH March 14, 2003. ALL PROPOSALS MUST BE RECEIVED BY MARAD NO LATER THAN 4 PM EST ON MARCH 14, 2003 TO BE CONSIDERED UNDER THIS SUBMISSION PERIOD.
The Maritime Administration (MARAD) is seeking innovative engineering/technical/ production/management solutions for the disposal of multiple obsolete vessels located in the reserve fleet sites in the James River, VA; Suisun Bay, CA; and Beaumont, TX.  A complete listing of obsolete vessels is attached for informational purposes as Attachment A.  The list of ships (Attachment A) is subject to change.  Some listed ships (and/or components of listed ships) may be subject to a "hold" or "not available" status due to commitments for sales, loans, and donations which were made prior to procurement actions associated with this PRDA announcement.  MARAD anticipates that the obsolete vessels in the worst condition, many of which are located in the James River Reserve Fleet, will be disposed of using traditional competitive contracting practices, depending on the availability of funding.  A draft Request for Proposal (RFP) has been issued to solicit industry comments to that end.

In an effort to obtain maximum program flexibility, the Government is seeking, from public and private concerns innovative solutions for the disposal of the remaining obsolete vessels by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2006.  The use and/or development of Government facilities is not excluded.


Criteria for Evaluating/Selecting Proposals:
Proposals in response to the PRDA must address, at a minimum, the following:

?Y Innovative engineering/technical/production/management approaches for the disposal of obsolete vessels identified in Attachment A
?Y Environmental and worker safety/health considerations associated with the disposal of obsolete vessels and the abatement of hazardous materials
?Y Production throughput/capacity with schedule and funding/cost relationships
?Y Offerors' requisite and relevant experience with the disposal of obsolete vessels
?Y Funding requirements associated with the proposed approach

In evaluating the offerors' submissions, the Government will consider the following criteria, listed in relative order of importance: 

?Y Feasibility and likelihood of success of engineering/technical/management approach for the disposal of obsolete vessels identified in Attachment A and the risks associated with the proposed approach
?Y Productivity of the proposed approach(s) including schedule/cost assessments
?Y Type and sufficiency of proposed environmental, worker safety and health considerations proposed and compliance with applicable laws
?Y Type and sufficiency of proposed abatement of hazardous materials and compliance with applicable laws
?Y Depth, relevance and currency of requisite experience with the complete disposal of obsolete vessels
?Y Realism and reasonableness of proposed funding requirements/costs when compared to the proposed engineering/technical/management solution


In selecting proposed solution(s), the Government will evaluate the overall best value to the Government, considering innovative technical solution(s) meeting the above listed minimum criteria at a reasonable price.   

Historically, the annual program level associated with MARAD ship disposal has been $10 million. The PRDA process permits the Government to evaluate each proposal on its own merit and potentially negotiate implementation of a Pilot Program(s) for proof of concept/methodology, as well as provide justification for budgetary purposes to support a proposed program.  Unlike procedures associated with unsolicited proposals, submissions made under the PRDA will not be advertised/competed.  Based on the evaluation results and budgetary constraints, the Governm a proposed program.  Unlike procedures associated with unsolicited proposals, submissions made under the PRDA will not be advertised/competed.  Based on the evaluation results and budgetary constraints, the Government may choose to select none, part of, or proposal(s) in their entirety to implement innovative solutions offered.

Amended Program Research and Develop Announcement (PRDA) 
for Ship Disposal Solutions

Preface: 
The purpose of this amendment to the PRDA (originally posted on October 19, 2001) is to: 1) clarify that vessel sales to interested parties is considered a viable option under this PRDA, 2) provide greater distribution of the announcement in order to reach foreign and domestic companies that were unaware of the original PRDA posting, and 3) offer interested companies an opportunity to visit the fleet sites to view the vessels available for disposal. 

Description:
The Maritime Administration (MARAD) is seeking innovative engineering/technical/ production/management/economic solutions for the disposal of multiple obsolete vessels located in the reserve fleet sites in the James River, VA; Suisun Bay, CA; and Beaumont, TX.  A complete listing of obsolete vessels is attached for informational purposes as Attachment A.  The list of ships (Attachment A) is subject to change.  Some listed ships (and/or components of listed ships) may be subject to a "hold" or "not available" status due to commitments for sales, loans, and donations which were made prior to procurement actions associated with this PRDA announcement.  

In an effort to obtain maximum program flexibility, the Government is seeking, from public and private concerns innovative solutions for the disposal of any or all non-retention, obsolete vessels in its custody.  The Government will consider innovative solutions including, but not limited to, vessel sales and ship disposal methodologies using and/or developing Government facilities.  Due to budgetary constraints, MARAD must place emphasis on the cost effectiveness/economic feasibility of any proposed approach. 

Opportunities for Fleet Site Visits
MARAD has established three periods, March 19, 20 & 21, April 16, 17, & 18, and MAY 21, 22 & 23 2002, for interested parties to visit the 3 fleet sites and view the ships listed in Attachment A.  The purpose of the fleet site visits is to provide interested parties with a general indoctrination tour of the fleets with minimal boarding of a few vessels that are representative of the types, ages and condition of MARAD?s obsolete ships.  The site visits are not intended as opportunities to conduct vessel surveys or acquire detailed information on specific vessels.  MARAD requires those interested in visiting one or more of the fleets sites to contact the point of contact (POC) at each site to be visited not later than Friday, March 15, 2002 to request to register for the March 19-21 fleet site visit, not later than Friday, April 12 to register for the April 16-18 fleet site visit, and not later than Friday, May 17 to register for the May 21-23 site visit.  The POC will request information regarding the identity of the visitors and information regarding the company/organization the visitor represents, and assign a time and date for the visit.  The POC will also inform potential visitors of fleet security requirements that shall be complied with prior to and during the visit, and will provide information regarding the location of the fleet sites.

<DESC>This amendment to synopsis/solicitation number USZA92-03-T-0038 answers contractor’s questions.  Q 25) In this solicitation you ask for a rendering of the exhibit using the red and black colors for the Army Special Operations Command.  Could you please e-mail me the requested logo graphic to include in this rendering and any example graphics to be included for illustration 
purposes only.  I have reviewed the web site and I am not clear exactly 
which logo's) would apply here and whether I should be working with a 
vertical or horizontal format.
A 25) No graphics or logos will be provided at this time.  They are available at the sites previously provided.  Again, the selection of photographs will not  be a consideration in the review of submitted designs.     

Q 26) Trade shows have rules and regulations pertaining to the height usage within the exhibit. This is a restriction based on cubic content. For example some shows will only allow you to place an exhibit item at a height of 8' and can only extend one-third the depth from the backwall of the exhibit space at 8' high. This would be 33" +/- in a 10 'x10' exhibit space.
What are the limitations for this RFQ?
A 26) The exhibit is used for more than just trade shows.  Designers should design exhibits that meet the most restrictive exhibit requirements. We consider the responding contractors to be the experts.

Q 27) If we specify a Plasma Screen are we still required to include a touch screen interactive?
A 27)  The system needs to be a turn-key operation.

Q28) What are the show rules and regulations pertaining to the use of the cubic content of the exhibit space?  If the space is 8' deep x 20' wide x 8' high can we use all the space at a 8' height or are we limited to 8' high at a depth of 1/3 the exhibit space?  
A 28) Show rules vary from location to location.  Following the 1/3 rule would be beneficial even though it will not always apply. 

Q 29)  what size should the kiosk be?  - should it be designed for viewing from one or two sides  
A 29)  A matter of design. 

Q 30)  what size should the touch tone screen be?  
A 30)  A matter of design.   

Q 31)  what size of plasma or lcd is preferred referencing "oversized"?  
A 31)  A matter of Design. 

Q 32)  is there a visual example of a 20 or 10 display for design style and direction?  
A 32)  A matter of design. 

Q33)  will the kiosk be set-up for both the 20' and 10' display configuations .  
A 33)  In different situations either the 20 or the 10 foot configuration will be used. 

Q 34)  does provided graphics mean electronic design for print reproduction, logos,  printed graphics, etc.?  - or will the final logo and printed "hard" graphics be provided?   
A 34)  We will provide final graphics in the format stipulated. 

Q35)  what size are the posters?   
A 35)  Varies but standard poster sizes. 

Q 36)  what kind and size of equipment will be display with posters and included for display?   
A 36 )  Varies with exhibit.  But equipment displayed will be tailored to meet the dimensions and load limitations of the display 

Q 37)  what kind, size and type of tables should be planned for the exhibit?  example: should these be 40" high counters by the exhibit backwall appx. 15"w x 36"?  
A 37) A matter of design.

The CECOM Power Generation Branch is soliciting information from manufacturers of Liquid-Fueled Fuel Cell Systems capable of providing continuous power that can be added to the Army inventory of available power sources for 21st Century tactical battlefield  applications.  Systems must utilize a liquid feedstock fuel, not hydrogen bottles, and produce a full continuous power output in the range of 2-60 kilowatts (kW), 12-50 volts direct current (VDC), 120/240 volts alternating current (VAC) or 120/208 VAC at 50,60, 400 Hertz (Hz) or selectable 50, 60, 400 Hz switch.  The Army is currently looking for information on both single phase and three phase systems with power factor from 0.5-1.0.  The program specifically seeks fully integrated, non-proof of concept sy stems.  Systems shall be comprised of a fuel cell, fuel delivery/storage, process control systems, power electronics, balance of plant (sensors, safety stops, etc.,) data collection, hardware/software and all other associated subsystems. There are several requirements for military operation.  The system must be mobile and must operate as a stand-alone system that requires no additional equipment for startup, operation or shutdown.  The Army is looking for systems that are able to operate i n all tactical military environments.  All systems should meet or come close to meeting the following specifications:  The system must be signature suppressed (i.e. Noise shall not exceed 65dBA at 7 meters, infrared signature shall be within 40Ã‚Â°F of amb ient background temperatures).  All systems should be rugged enough to support field use for battery charging and other troop support power requirements.  Systems should comply with current military requirements for EMI per MIL-STD-461.  Please address you r ability to operate in the following environments:  -25Ã‚Â°F to 120Ã‚Â°F, rain, humidity, altitude (sea level to 4,000 ft), sand/dust, rail transport, cold storage at -65Ã‚Â°F, salt spray, fungus, derate 3.5%/1000ft, max power rating at 110%; and all Elec tric Power Quality Requirements (per MIL-STD-1332B). There is no funding or plans to procure systems that meet with the above requirements at this time.  This announcement is seeking White Papers, not exceeding ten pages in length, describing the contractors experience in design, development, fabrication and  testing of liquid fueled fuel cell power systems, organizational capabilities and a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) unit cost for potential future government procurements.    The white paper shall also contain information regarding the availability of fuel  cell systems for loan or lease.  The Government will not reimburse vendors for any information received in this RFI. The data received in response to this request for information (RFI) will be used for information purposes only and does not, in any way, mandate or impose requirements.  It is highly desirable for the Government to receive unlimited rights to the data prov ided, however, it is recognized that proprietary data may be included with the information provided.  If this is the case, proprietary data must be clearly marked and clearly separated from the unrestricted information as an addendum.  Proprietary informat ion will be protected. White papers should be submitted within 45 calendar days of issuance of this announcement.  Responses must be submitted via electronic mail to Ms. Michelle N. Gaffney, Project Engineer at michelle.gaffney@armypower.army.mil.  The subject line of the email message should be 'White Paper Response, Liquid-Fueled Fuel Cell Systems - Company 's Name'.  All questions of a technical nature should be directed to Ms. Gaffney at the above email address.  Questions of a contractual nature should be directed to Ms. Patricia Davis, Contracting Officer, at pat.davis@cacw.army.mil.  No telephonic inquir ies or requests will be honored.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to identify qualified sources for the production of Caliber .50 M858 Ball and M860 Trace Plastic training cartridges.  These cartridges are intended for use in training areas where range restrictions preclude the use of full range standard service ammunition.  They provide the ability to increase the frequency of training and hence the proficiency of the user by affording training areas previously closed by range restrictions.  The cartridges are designed to be used in the Caliber .50 M2 machine gun with a M3 Recoil Adapter.  The maximum safety range is 700 meters and the effective training range is 150 meters.  The Tracer cartridge exhibits a visible trace up to 150 meters.  An initial quantity of approximately 610,000 rounds will be required with three options totaling approximately 1,400,000 rounds.  Delivery is expected three months after contract award. Any source interested in competing for the award of a production contract must first become a qualified source.  In order to be eligible for award a design must be qualified prior to contract award (see FAR 9.206-1{c})  In order to be qualified, each design must undergo an extensive battery of tests as specified in the Government Performance Specification for the M858. Any contractor interested in qualifying their design shall be fully responsible for all coordination and costs associated with the qualification test.  Upon request, any interested contractor will be supplied with the procedures necessary to qualify a new design. Responses will be evaluated by the Government and will be used to augment the Bidder's Mailing List. A notice in Federal Business Opportunities will be issued prior to the release of the solicitation.

<DESC>Description of Need: The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is defining its acquisition strategy for the procurement of TH-6B helicopter parts and overhaul services for the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School (USNTPS).  The TH-6B helicopters are configured as variants of the commercial McDonnell Douglas MD369H. .  Depending on the information gathered from this announcement, it is our intent to solicit competitive proposals for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for parts and overhaul services for six TH-6Bs.  The contract will cover a period of five years comprised of one base year and four one-year options. The anticipated effort includes, but is not limited to, providing compatible, newly manufactured components and materials for routine maintenance and/or for repairs following mishaps or overstress incidents; providing overhaul and repair of USNTPS components to FAA specifications. Request for Information and Sources Sought: The purpose of this announcement is to: (1) determine the current industry base of potential qualified vendors to support the possibility of an other than full and open competition, 100% small business set-aside to satisfy the requirement identified; and, (2) seek recommendations from industry, based on our intent to award a five year IDIQ contract, on the most preferred contracting method using either Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12 or 15 procedures to acquire the required supplies and services.  FAR Part 12.207 -- Contract Type, requires that the Agencies shall use firm-fixed-price contracts or fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment for the acquisition of commercial items. Indefinite-delivery contracts (see Subpart 16.5) may be used where the prices are established based on a firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment. Use of any other contract type to acquire commercial items is prohibited.  We are seeking industry recommendations on how the Government can satisfy the above stated provision, while acknowledging that some of the parts maybe difficult to acquire in a reliable manner.  The Government intends to use the information collected from this announcement and other sources to aid it in defining its final acquisition strategy.   Responses to this announcement shall be submitted no later than 14 March 2003 to: Department of the Navy, Naval Air Systems Command, Attn: Mr. Fritz Musser (AIR 2.4.3.2.6), Building 441, Unit 7, 21983 Bundy Road, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1127 Attn:  TH-6B.

If providing the information electronically, please ensure that the information is compatible and accessible using Microsoft Office 98 software.  Additional Information: Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional information is available.  Requests for the same will be disregarded.  There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties in support of the effort mentioned above.  Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a contract.  If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website located at www.fedbizops.gov.

<DESC>The US Air Force Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab is exploring commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) technologies related to an air compressor/power generator suite to fit into a designated space on a prototype aerospace ground equipment (AGE) cart.  This suite is required to condense the maintenance footprint at deployed and home duty stations.  The suite must be capable of producing 400 Hz, 3-phase, 60 kW of sustainable aircraft power.  The air compressor portion must be able to provide sustainable high volume (80 cubic feet per minute) air.  It should be noted that a combined suite is not an overall requirement.  In a limited-space area, client preference is for power generation over air compression.  The suite has an approximate dimension space of 30” W x 78” L x 57” H x 30” D.  Other requirements for this system are: should be able to withstand diverse weather climates found on Air Force flight lines; have standard power generation such as a diesel or gas turbine engine; be easy to maintain. Through this Request for Information (RFI), the Air Force is requesting information concerning mature technologies, which meet the requirements previously stated, to be used in a Battlelab study. The primary selection criteria for all submissions will be the most practical system available to support the requirements.  All offerors are strongly encouraged to submit information supporting this request.  Currently, there is only limited Battlelab funding identified for this program, however, if research indicates that the technology is available and transferable to the USAF, funding may be sought for prototype demonstration and recommended to Headquarters, Air Combat Command. NOTICE TO FOREIGN OFFERORS: Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures and restrictions that could preclude their participation in this announcement.  SUBMISSIONS: Product Information may be submitted until COB EST 29 August 2003.  White papers should not exceed five pages plus cover letter.  Electronic responses shall be submitted in MS Word format or Adobe PDF file.  Refer technical questions and submit product information to Mr. Edward Lillion of Concurrent Technologies Corporation via email at lillione@ctcnsc.org or by mail to 100 CTC Drive, Johnstown, PA 15904-1935.  The single point of contact concerning this Sources Sought Notice is Mr. Lillion.  You may contact Mr. Lillion with any questions you may have at (814) 269-6516.  Electronic submittals are strongly encouraged.  GENERAL RFI INFORMATION: This notice itself constitutes the RFI per FAR Part 10 and 15.201(e).  This RFI is an expression of interest only and does not obligate the Air Force to pay any proposal preparation and prototype costs or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions.  Offerors are advised that only Air Force Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government to the obligation of funds. For copyright purposes, offerors are also advised that submitting a proposal implies express permission for Concurrent Technologies Corporation personnel to use the data, pictures, and other information contained in the received proposals for the report back to the client.

<DESC>The Department of Transportation (DOT), Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST) plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to provide an evaluation model of passenger demand for air travel, including access to relevant non-U.S. DOT data.  Sources will examine how demand for air travel has changed in recent years, incorporating the current industry downturn, and especially to identify differences in passenger responses at different price levels.  Specialized service and knowledge of the airline industry as well as access to non-US DOT data sources (such as MIDT, travel agency, and/or airline ticket bid-price data) which provide information, particularly about passengers’ propensity to pay and that distinguishes between types of markets and passenger demand segments.  These data sources must contain data not available in USDOT databases, including (for example) 1) passengers’ propensity to pay, 2) passengers’ purpose of travel, and 3) passengers’ booking window.  These data sources must facilitate 1) inclusion of a multiple-year time period for data trend analyses; 2) inclusion of markets representing 90% or more of total passenger traffic; 3) separate analyses for different market type/passenger demand segments; and 4) compatibility with US DOT databases.

<ZIP>20590
<OFFADD>Department of Transportation, Maritime Administration (MARAD), MAR-380, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Room 7310, Washington, DC, 20590
<SUBJECT>B -- Program Reserach and Development Announcement  (PRDA) for Ship Disposal Solutions
<DESC>Program Research and Develop Announcement (PRDA) 
for Ship Disposal Solutions

Description:
The Maritime Administration (MARAD) is seeking innovative engineering/technical/ production/management solutions for the disposal of multiple obsolete vessels located in the reserve fleet sites in the James River, VA; Suisun Bay, CA; and Beaumont, TX.  A complete listing of obsolete vessels is attached for informational purposes as Attachment A.  The list of ships (Attachment A) is subject to change.  Some listed ships (and/or components of listed ships) may be subject to a "hold" or "not available" status due to commitments for sales, loans, and donations which were made prior to procurement actions associated with this PRDA announcement.  MARAD anticipates that the obsolete vessels in the worst condition, many of which are located in the James River Reserve Fleet, will be disposed of using traditional competitive contracting practices, depending on the availability of funding.  A draft Request for Proposal (RFP) has been issued to solicit industry comments to that end.

In an effort to obtain maximum program flexibility, the Government is seeking, from public and private concerns innovative solutions for the disposal of the remaining obsolete vessels by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2006.  The use and/or development of Government facilities is not excluded.


Criteria for Evaluating/Selecting Proposals:
Proposals in response to the PRDA must address, at a minimum, the following:

&#61608; Innovative engineering/technical/production/management approaches for the disposal of obsolete vessels identified in Attachment A
&#61608; Environmental and worker safety/health considerations associated with the disposal of obsolete vessels and the abatement of hazardous materials
&#61608; Production throughput/capacity with schedule and funding/cost relationships
&#61608; Offerors' requisite and relevant experience with the disposal of obsolete vessels
&#61608; Funding requirements associated with the proposed approach

In evaluating the offerors' submissions, the Government will consider the following criteria, listed in relative order of importance: 

&#61608; Feasibility and likelihood of success of engineering/technical/management approach for the disposal of obsolete vessels identified in Attachment A and the risks associated with the proposed approach
&#61608; Productivity of the proposed approach(s) including schedule/cost assessments
&#61608; Type and sufficiency of proposed environmental, worker safety and health considerations proposed and compliance with applicable laws
&#61608; Type and sufficiency of proposed abatement of hazardous materials and compliance with applicable laws
&#61608; Depth, relevance and currency of requisite experience with the complete disposal of obsolete vessels
&#61608; Realism and reasonableness of proposed funding requirements/costs when compared to the proposed engineering/technical/management solution


In selecting proposed solution(s), the Government will evaluate the overall best value to the Government, considering innovative technical solution(s) meeting the above listed minimum criteria at a reasonable price.   

Historically, the annual program level associated with MARAD ship disposal has been $10 million. The PRDA process permits the Government to evaluate each proposal on its own merit and potentially negotiate implementation of a Pilot Program(s) for proof of concept/methodology, as well as provide justification for budgetary purposes to support a proposed program.  Unlike procedures associated with unsolicited proposals, submissions made under the PRDA will not be advertised/competed.  Based on the evaluation results and budgetary constraints, the Government may choose to select none, part of, or proposal(s) in their entirety to implement innovative solutions offered. 

Instructions for the Preparation of Proposals:
To be given evaluation consideration, submissions in response to this PRDA must conform to the following standards:

1. Technical/engineering/production/management solutions, inclusive of the listing below,  shall not exceed 25 typewritten pages, single sided, single spaced, Arial, 12 pitch:
&#61608; Production throughput/capacity
&#61608; Environmental considerations
&#61608; Worker safety and health considerations
&#61608; Hazardous abatement considerations
&#61608; Requisite experience

2. Funding/pricing requirements must be proposed in sufficient enough detail to show all anticipated costs associated with the complete dismantlement of the vessel(s), including cost categories such as towing, remediation of hazardous materials, labor costs etc, as appropriate. Pricing information must be detailed enough to permit the Government to make a determination of cost realism and reasonableness when assessed against the proposed approach. 
Submission of pricing information shall not exceed 3 typewritten pages, single sided, single-spaced, Arial, 12 pitch.

Individual offeror?s may submit multiple proposals.  Proposals must be separable and each in accordance with the above criteria.

 Instructions for the Submission of Proposals:
Initial responses to this PRDA must be submitted not later than 2:00 pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) on November15, 2001 to:

	U.S. Department of Transportation
	Maritime Administration

	Attn: Ms. Rilla Gaither

Offerors must submit five (5) complete copies for each proposed approach, inclusive of  technical/engineering/production/management and funding/pricing proposals. Electronic submissions will not be accepted.

<SUBJECT>R -- CSC Technical Support Services
<DESC>The NOAA Coastal Services Center (Center) anticipates issuing a formal competitive solicitation in the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2004 for technical support services which may consist of spatial data development and management; modeling and software application development; relational database development and programming; geospatial data standards development; product development and analysis; image processing; field verification and accuracy assessments; risk and vulnerability assessments; ocean and coastal observations, monitoring, and prediction; Internet-based coastal information accessibility and web site development; ecological characterization and watershed modeling; reference library services; graphics; outreach; customer assessments and requirements analysis; social sciences application to resource management issues; community planning; fellowship and assistantship coordination; technical writing; public relations; training and technical assistance; conference and meeting planning; program and project analysis and reporting; organizational planning; information collection and analysis; and general organizational and project management support.  The Center expects to award one technical service contract with a basic period of performance of one year with four (4) one-year options for renewal to a source whose proposal represents the best value to the Government.  The Government’s estimated cost is $25M to $35M over the five-year period.  

In anticipation of this solicitation, the Center will host an Industry Day forum on Wednesday, 3 September 2003 at their facilities located in Charleston, South Carolina.  Technical services potentially will be required in other coastal areas.  The purpose is to provide all interested parties an opportunity to learn about the Center and the process for this acquisition.  It will be an excellent opportunity to provide potential provider input regarding evaluation criteria, contract terms and conditions, and overall program execution.  Government program and contract managers will be available to respond to questions you may have about the requirement or acquisition process.  Additional information on Industry Day can be found at www.csc.noaa.gov/conops/conops.html.  A registration form and agenda is included within this website.  There is no cost for attending Industry Day and attendance is voluntary.  It is requested that you download the registration form, complete the information, and return it to either the Contracting Officer, Melvyn DesJarlais or the Contract Specialist, Michelle Morales via fax not later than 27 August 2003.  There will be a question and answer period during Industry Day where the Government will answer questions from attendees.  Questions can be submitted prior to Industry Day via the registration form or asked during the afternoon session.  ONLY INDIVIDUALS THAT PRE-REGISTER WILL BE ABLE TO ATTEND.  DUE TO LIMITED SEATING, ONLY TWO REPRESENTATIVES PER COMPANY WILL BE ALLOWED TO ATTEND.  

In addition, parties interested in attending Industry Day are encouraged to submit via email by 27 August 2003 a short statement of capability and experience for satisfying this requirement (No more than 3 pages, Times font, 12 point, 1 inch margins, single-sided, 8.5 inch x 11 inch page size) to Melvyn DesJarlais or Michelle Morales.  Please state whether you represent a large, small or disadvantaged business concern.  The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be part of this effort. If so included, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information. Questions may be directed to either Melvyn DesJarlais or Michelle Morales.  No hard copies via regular mail are requested at this time.  For those individuals unable to attend the forum, the meeting notes and Government presented materials will be posted to the CONOPS website.

This announcement is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire follow-on acquisition. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this announcement, or otherwise pay for information requested. The Government will not reimburse the attendees for any costs associated with participation and is under no obligation to award any related contract associated with this event.  Recording devices are prohibited at the forum.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS AT THIS TIME.

IHS is the only company that can provide these services for these critical standards in a manner that is most cost effective to the Government.  Splitting the sources and locations of reference materials defeats the purpose of a centralized source of information.  Decentralized sources of information to query complicates searches, permits required reference material to be overlooked and increases the risk of pertinent data being overlooked.  Brand name is not an essential element, a single comprehensive web-based service is.

Measures taken to identify drug offenses on military installations and to prevent introduction of illegal drugs and paraphernalia include routine random inspection of personal possessions on entry or exit. If there is probable cause to believe that the contractor has been engaged in use, possession, or trafficking of drugs, the contractor may be detained for a limited period of time until he or she can be removed from the installation or turned over to the local law enforcement personnel having jurisdiction. When illegal drugs are discovered tin the course of an inspection or search or a vehicle operated by a contractor, the contractor and vehicle may be detained for a reasonable period of time necessary to surrender the individual and vehicle to appropriate civil law enforcement personnel. Action may be taken to suspend working privileges as well as installation driving privileges.

These pictures do not require the same level of special handling as those items listed within the collection.  It is anticipated that about 150 pictures will be removed from the areas at the same time.  This work will be performed on a unit price basis.  2.3 SCOPE OF SERVICES BY OTHERS This work does not include the relocation of furniture, boxes or computer equipment.   It does not include moving the collection of the USPTO museum and affiliates. 3.  WORK PHASING The moves are scheduled to coincide with the construction completion of the buildings at Carlyle.  As such there are three general move phases.  Phase I: The Remsen Building, the Jefferson Building, and the Carlyle Townhouse are scheduled to be occupied between November 2003 and March 2004.  There is minimal work planned associated with these buildings.  Phase II:  The Madison Building, the Randolph Building and Elizabeth Townhouse are scheduled to be occupied between April 2004 and December 2004.   The majority of the collections will be moved during this time.  Phase III:  The Knox Building is scheduled to be occupied between January 2005 and July 2005.  There is no work planned associated with the Knox Building.  4.  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS 4.4 ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT FACILITIES During the life of the contract, the rights of ingress and egress to and from the Government facility for Contractor personnel shall be made available as required.  During all operations on Government premises, Contractor personnel shall comply with the rules and regulations governing the conduct of personnel and the operation of the facility.  The Government reserves the right to require Contractor personnel to sign in upon ingress and sign out upon egress of the Government facility.  4.5 COORDINATION WITH OTHERS The moves will occur in occupied buildings in Crystal City and at Carlyle.  Carlyle will be an active construction site.  Therefore, it should be anticipated that other routine operations and activities would be encountered during the move.  The occupancy of the Carlyle site requires numerous activities and tasks from various Contractors, including another vendor relocating computer equipment and another vendor relocating personnel and furniture.  Although the move will be coordinated to minimize interferences, the Contractor should anticipate the need for some flexibility.  It is the intent to schedule the packing and removal of the collection before the personnel of an area is moved.  In a similar concept, it is the intent to have the collection installed after the personnel have moved.  5.  MOVING REQUIREMENTS The Contractor will provide the removal, packing and crating of the collection.   Handling of the collections shall be performed in a professional manner.  The Contractor will provide the packing and crating material.  The Contractor is expected to provide a sufficient number and type of moving equipment to efficiently and effectively conduct the move.  This equipment includes such items as vehicles, dollies, stevedores, and library carts.  The Contractor will store the artwork at their facility between removal from Crystal City and installation of Carlyle.  For bidding purposes assume storage duration of three weeks.  All equipment is to be in a safe and good working condition.  Damage to government property as a result of faulty equipment is the responsibility of the Contractor.  The Contractor will remove and dispose of the packing and crating material.  Additional Contract Requirements:  6.  PERSONNEL 6.1 SUPERVISOR The Contractor shall assign a full time supervisor for each crew utilized in the performance of this work.  The supervisor shall be responsible for compliance of all of the crew with the conditions of this contract.  The moving supervisors must have demonstrated experience with moving collections.  6.2 PESONNEL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS The supervisor is responsible for all personnel under this contract in government space.  All non-U.S. citizens to be employed under this contract must have official legal status in the United States.  The Contractor shall submit to USPTO the names and social security number or work identification permit number of all personnel proposed to be working for each shift at least one working day before the shift begins.  Personnel backgrounds may be checked.  Personnel working for the Contractor may have temporary USPTO badges issued at the beginning of each shift.  The moving personnel must visibly wear the badges at all times.  At the end of each shift, the badges must be returned.  Issuance of temporary badges does not signify approval for the personnel to be in USPTO areas other than that area directly required to perform the move or that the personnel will be permitted to work on subsequent tasks.

<DESC>The USDA, ARS, LSO intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source Trek Diagnostic Systems, 982 Keynote Circle, Suite A, Cleveland, OH.  The proposed award is for two V3209 autoreaders.  The sensititre autoreader is a microplate single excitation/detection wavelength fluorimeter.  The Autoreader measures fluorescent growth from prepared bacterial isolates that have been inoculated into a customized 96-well plate.  The Autoreader may be used alone or in conjunction with the ARIS system; however the ARIS system must have an AutoReader available for its proper function.  The AutoReader is linked via serial port to a computer equipped with Sensititre software which captures, records and analyzes data.  These autoreaders need to operate with the SAMS software package used for the analysis of susceptibility test results to track the development of antimicrobial resistance in veterinary isolates as it arises in an attempt to arrest the development and spread of resistance, especially among food borne pathogens.  In order to maintain consistent testing of isolates and comparability of data, the autoreaders established at NARMS participating sites must be used.  NARMS, National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System, locations must be consistent in their use of identical antimicrobial susceptibility testing protocols.  This procurement will be made pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(2)(C)(ii).  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  If any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they must submit a proposal in writing that includes prices and technical data sufficient to determine capability to meet the entire requirement and must be received in this office within 7 calendar days after publication of this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  (Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial items).

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Munitions Directorate, Ordnance Division, Energetic Materials Branch (MNME) seeks commercial quotations for a highly-specialized pulsed-laser spectroscopic diagnostic system.  The following paragraphs explain the minimum technical specifications/requirements for the spectroscopic detection component of this system, consisting of a multiple-grating spectrograph equipped with an intensified, gated, charge-coupled-device (IgCCD) detector, an electronic detector control unit, and data acquisition and analysis software.

Basic Configuration:  In this paragraph, system components to be provided by the vendor are discussed. Those to be provided by AFRL/MNME are identified as “government furnished equipment (GFE)”.  The GFE will not be made available to the vendor for testing.  The IgCCD detector will attach via a spectrometer mount to the spectrometer which contains a number of interchangeable diffraction gratings.  A camera adapter will also be provided to permit attaching the IgCCD detector to a standard F-mount bayonet style camera lens (GFE).  Vendor will supply any interface computer card required for communication between the IgCCD detector’s electronic control unit and an IBM-compatible personal computer (GFE).  This computer will run a Windows 2000 compatible software package to control the function of, and collect data from, the electronic control unit.  The system will include all power supplies, power cables, and control cables required for 110 VAC single phase 60 Hz operation.  

Mechanical Dimensions:  The IgCCD’s image intensifier photocathode will cover an approximately 25 x 7 mm rectangular area.  The image intensifier output will be fiber optically coupled to a CCD having at least 1000 x 250 pixels.  The spectrometer will have an input aperture ratio of approximately f/4, a minimum focal length of 250 mm, and will provide a wavelength dispersed image of the spectrometer input slit over a flat output focal plane large enough to overfill the IgCCD photocathode.
  
System Performance:  The system must be capable of recording spectra over the 200 to 800 nm wavelength range, with non-interchangeable components chosen to optimize performance over the 200 to 500 nm range.  Interchangeable diffraction gratings will be provided to permit recording spectra over approximately:  (a) 65 nm, 125 nm, and 250 nm wide regions anywhere in the 200 to 500 nm range, (b) 125 nm and 250 nm wide regions in the 500 to 800 nm range, and (c) a 500 nm region covering 300 to 800 nm.  The IgCCD detector will be capable of resolving at least 40 line-pairs per mm.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number for this solicitation is RML-RFQ-3042. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-15 dated 07/24/03. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 and the small business size is 500. The Rocky Mountain Laboratories, RML, Laboratory of Human Bacterial Pathogenesis (LHBP) performs research on multiple, diverse human bacterial pathogens and the host/bacterial response during infection. The LHBP has purchased a custom designed, multi-genome GeneChip probe array specific to RML needs, containing the following bacterial genomes: Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia pestis, Borrelia burgdorferi and Coxiella burnettii and Chlamydia trachomatis from Affymetrix. This chip is unique and specific to RML. These gene chips will be used in RML experiments to analyze the bacterial response during host infection. The LHBP intends to purchase 4 lots of custom probe arrays, at 90 chips per lot. The multi-genome GeneChip probe array must enable identification of 2-fold or greater levels of change in expression levels, and detection of as little as 1 mRNA transcript in a complex mixture of 100,000. The GeneChip probe array must contain multiple unique probes designed to be Perfect Match (PM), 25-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs, to represent each mRNA transcript (full length gene) tested, and multiple probes designed to be Mis-Match (MM), to enable calibration of non-specific hybridization data (USPNos.5527681). Additional control sequences (yeast and commensal) must also be available on the chip for hybridization control, and housekeeping gene analysis. The probe selection strategy for the multi-genome custom GeneChip probe array must be based upon a probe design database and must be able to distinguish between highly homologous sequences and those of closely related gene families, strains, species and genus of bacteria. The multi-genome custom GeneChip probe array will be housed in a fixed volume reaction chamber providing automated and consistent hybridization of samples to the array. The chips processed by NIAID are in Frederick, MD containing the Affymetrix GeneArray Scanner, Fluidics Station, 640 Hybridization Oven, Micro Array Suite/Data Mining Tool, MicroDB, and LIMS software database. The photolithography-based chip, must be compatible with the Affymetrix system currently in place in Frederick, MD. There is no photolithography-based chip processing system on site at RML.
