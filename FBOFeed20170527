The review revealed that the Government does not possess the in-depth technical knowledge; or the required technical documentation; or it is not up-to-date; or it is incomplete in content for full and open competition. Configuration control of commercial parts is insufficient when purchase from sources other than the Q-70 system integrator.

<p>MCC DCO TVS Advisory Services in Philippines</p>
<p>C.1.	Introduction</p>
<p>The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is a U.S. Government Agency established under the Millennium Challenge Act of 2003. MCC works with developing countries and provides aid that reinforces sound political, economic, and social policies that promote poverty reduction through economic growth. The majority of countries eligible for MCC funding have requested assistance in addressing local infrastructure needs. As such, MCC requires technical advisory support for a range of consulting services in connection with the development, assessment, design, delivery, and operations of infrastructure projects in countries in the process of developing their Compacts. For more information on MCC, please visit www.mcc.gov.</p>
<p>C.2.	Background</p>
<p>In December 2014, MCC's Board of Directors ("the Board") selected the Philippines as eligible to develop a second Compact. Following the Board's decision, the Government of the Philippines (GOPH) and MCC collectively developed a Constraints to Growth Analysis ("the CA") - a diagnostic tool used by MCC to assess the biding constraints to economic growth and assist MCC in the selection and design of potential Compact projects. The CA built off previous analysis undertaken by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the US Government through its Partnership for Growth (PFG) Initiative, and specifically identified the following four constraints:</p>
<p>a)	Government coordination and implementation capacity,</p>
<p>b)	The high cost of transport logistics,</p>
<p>c)	The high cost of electricity, and</p>
<p>d)	Market failure in the rural economy.</p>
<p>The GHP - acting through a dedicated Compact Development Team ("the CDT") - and the MCC Philippines II Country Team ("the CT") jointly agreed to address the final constraint (market failure in the rural economy) as the primary focus of a potential second Compact with MCC, with the recognition that that two of the other three identified constrains - the high cost of transportation logistics and Government coordination and effectiveness - were contributory to market failures in the rural economy.</p>
<p>In February 2016, the CDT formally submitted a Concept Note (CN) focused on linking farmers with growing markets, specifically identifying the problem of low agricultural productivity and competitiveness as a central issue to address in the second Compact. In March 2016, the CDT officially submitted project proposals to MCC   containing capital-intensive investments in transport and logistics infrastructure, in support of efforts to link rural and agricultural communities with larger markets.</p>
<p>Philippines Transport and Logistics Infrastructure Context</p>
<p>Transport is a key sector in the Philippine economy, linking population and economic centers across the islands. The transport system of the Philippines consists of road, water, air, and rail transport. Water transport plays an important role due to the archipelagic nature of the country, but road transport is by far the dominant subsector accounting for 98% of passenger traffic and 58% of cargo traffic. While the transport infrastructure has been developed and spread across the country (about 215,000 kilometers [km] of roads, 1,300 public and private ports, and 215 public and private airports), the level of service has not been sufficient due to the lack of sustainable financing. Improving transport infrastructure is critical for strengthening the investment climate and enhancing economic growth. The Philippines has seen modest improvement in the quality of its transport services, but a large part of the road network remains in poor condition and intermodal integration is generally weak. Poor sector governance also impedes efficient operation of the sector .</p>
<p>The country's deficit in transport and logistics infrastructure has already been identified as one of the binding constraints to growth at an aggregate level, as it was even in the constraints analysis under the First Compact. This continuing inefficiency is also reflected in the rural sector, where high transport and logistics costs contribute to weak or missing markets, preventing small producers from linking to stronger value chains. Transport and logistics costs account for a significant portion of the total cost of goods. For example, high domestic shipping costs were cited by multiple agribusiness firms during consultations as a barrier to sourcing and moving goods domestically. Research shows that logistics costs, including transportation costs, account for as much as one-third of the total cost of producing high-value vegetables.</p>
<p>The inefficiency in the road networks and port and shipping services lead to losses during transport of the produce, adversely affecting the profitability of key players in the supply chain. It is estimated that around 20-50 percent of fresh produce can be lost as it moves along the supply chain from the farm to the end consumers. The Government's approach to market-creation in behalf of small farmers has emphasized road infrastructure, particularly farm-to-market roads (FMRs).</p>
<p>Beyond road infrastructure, it is important to remember that the Philippines' geography frequently necessitates multi-modal transport and logistics to connect rural production regions with urban demand centers and gateways of export to the ASEAN region and beyond. Thus, an integrated approach to assessing agribusiness supply chains is needed, starting from the perspective of demand and market locations and tracing the specific transport and logistics obstacles for key value chains. Lack access to modern large-scale transport and storage facilities, which require significant capital outlays or access to credit currently beyond the reach of farmers and their organizations.</p>
<p>Key Areas of Focus in Transport and Logistics Infrastructure for Possible MCC Interventions</p>
<p>MCC investment in transport and logistics infrastructure projects will focus on aspects that are strategic and critical to stimulate trade and investments as well as enhance mobility and improve linkages between islands/provide access to markets/activity centers, as well as support the agro-fisheries sector, such as:</p>
<p>a)	Road/highway and bridge infrastructure connecting, including farm-to-market roads connecting major production hubs with regional and international markets.</p>
<p>b)	Integrated multi-modal transport centers and depot facilities interconnecting other transport modes in major selected urban areas.</p>
<p>c)	Secondary roll-on, roll-out (RoRo) ports and civil airport upgrading.</p>
<p>d)	Logistic and market infrastructure, such as cold-storage facilities, warehousing, and intermediate processing facilities, to support specific value chain, etc.</p>
<p>e)	Policy, regularity, and institutional reforms as well as technical assistance in the transport sector to encourage private sector participation in transport sector and ensure long-term sustainability.</p>
<p>MCC Philippines II Compact Development Process</p>
<p>The table below is a summary of the main activities conducted by both MCC and country counterparts during the Compact development process.  Currently, the process in the Philippines is at the due diligence and project development stages, with a Concept Paper provided by the Government of the Philippines (GOPH) in March of 2016.</p>
<p>Compact Development Process (Up to Compact Entry into Force)</p>

<p>C.3.	Objective</p>
<p>MCC will work with the GOPH to identify and prepare project proposal for a Compact program to support the Philippines multi-modal transport and logistics sectors to support a set of value chains in selected regions. These concepts are likely to include both capital-intensive infrastructure initiatives and activities related to strengthening policy, legal, regulatory, and technical planning processes, and supportive institutional reform. MCC will require the Contractor support to provide Technical Support Advisory (TSA) services in support of the Compact development process. In addition, MCC will require TSA services in support of Compact implementation. Work will be assigned to the Contractor based on Call Orders. Through informal exchanges, the GOPH has identified initial project concepts that will form the basis for the Concept Papers required through MCC's Compact Development Guidelines.</p>
<p>C.4.	Scope</p>
<p>The Transport and Vertical Structures (TVS) Practice Group at the MCC requires a Contractor to provide technical advisory services during the development and preparation of a MCC Compact in the Philippines as well as provide oversight support to the MCC during the implementation of proposed the investments in the transport and logistics projects. These projects would include, but not limited to, highways, ports, airports, rail, and intermodal transport as well as logistics infrastructure such as cold-storage, warehouse, processing facilities projects consistent with the MCC Compact with Philippines.</p>
<p>Many of the Contractor's efforts will incorporate and expand on prior analyses by MCC as well as that by GOPH and stakeholders, and the Contractor should refer to such previous analyses where available. When possible, MCC will assist in obtaining these documents. Contractor must note that these documents may be sensitive and confidential, therefore they must be handled appropriately.</p>
<p>C.5.	Tasks</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide technical advice, analysis, guidance, and recommendations on the overall merit of proposed projects and their policy, institutional, regulatory and technical context proposed by the GOPH or potential alternative projects in order to inform MCC's investment decisions and to recommend actions to address gaps, inadequacies, and risks in terms of cost, quality, performance, and successful implementation during the anticipated Compact period.</p>
<p>The scope of projects to be assessed will include transport and logistics infrastructure activities as well as legal and institutional activities to improve operations and sustainability with explicit considerations of private sector participation.</p>
<p>All work will be mobilized via more targeted Technical Directives indicating scope and deliverables associated with the General Tasks described in this section.</p>
<p>C.5.1.	General Tasks</p>
<p>Project Definition and Sector Situation Assessment</p>
<p>The situation assessment represents an initial review of the technical (infrastructure), institutional, regulatory, and policy environment in the country's transport sector and logistics. Based on this early assessment, coupled with a review of the project Concept Paper submitted by the GOPH, the Contractor shall make recommendations with regards to optimal project definition and design. These recommendations shall also reflect MCC's focus on:</p>
<p>1.	Advancing sector reform, and restructuring, to improve sector performance;</p>
<p>2.	Ensuring financial sustainability of investments within the transport sector;</p>
<p>3.	Catalyzing private sector investment necessary to meet the country's sustainable growth ambitions; and</p>
<p>4.	Promoting development that is sustainable in terms of economy, environment and equity, by requiring project development in accordance with international environmental and social standards as well as MCC's Gender Policy and Gender Integration Guidelines.</p>
<p>To facilitate project definition, the Contractor shall identify the need for and develop terms of reference and budgets for supplemental feasibility studies or sector master plans that MCC might fund using dedicated project preparation funds, and which may be completed in parallel with and would inform continued due diligence work.</p>
<p>Project Appraisal</p>
<p>The Contractor shall appraise the absolute and relative merits of projects proposed by the GOPH for inclusion in the Compact, such as their consistency with any available sector master plans, technical feasibility, cost, implementation requirements, risk, environmental, social and gender impacts and opportunities, including resettlement, and projected benefits and the socioeconomic distribution of those benefits relevant to their economic impact and beneficiary analysis. The Contractor will also assess and summarize related activities underway or planned by the GOPH, the private sector, and other donors. Based on this research and analysis, the Contractor shall suggest alternative investments that may be considered priorities over or enhancements to those proposed or underway or planned by other entities. Where projects lack full feasibility studies, the Contractor shall identify the gaps in analysis and contribute to project development and definition. The analysis and final recommendations shall also address issues of long-term sustainability and sector growth.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall review studies and reports as directed by MCC. The Contractor shall also review reports related to the institutional reform and capacity building of transport sector institutions.</p>
<p>Sector Situation Assessment</p>
<p>The Contractor shall conduct or update a baseline situation assessment of the transport and logistics sectors in the Philippines. This shall include:</p>
<p>1.	Legal/regulatory, policy and institutional assessment, including progress against and/or gaps in implementation of sector reforms;</p>
<p>2.	Evaluation of the technical processes and institutional roles for conducting transportation planning and investment prioritization, at modal, multimodal, and jurisdictional levels (e.g., city, regional, provincial, national);</p>
<p>3.	Evaluation of the Government's transport and logistics sectors infrastructure and related investment plans or lack thereof;</p>
<p>4.	Evaluation of the potential for private sector investment versus public investment, and/or public- private partnerships (PPPs);</p>
<p>5.	Overview of maintenance system and condition assessment, including a review of its operations, operating policies and procedures, management information systems, and financial and management accounts and procedures;</p>
<p>6.	Preliminary identification of opportunities for improvement including safety measures for pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles; and</p>
<p>7.	A political economy analysis of the transport sector.</p>
<p>In this assessment, the Contractor shall highlight (and offer evidence to support) the root causes for and possible solutions to problems currently inhibiting optimal sector development, including investment/participation by the private sector. This assessment will contribute to the shaping of a sector reform program to be included in the Compact, in the form of actual investments and activities or conditions precedent that might be supported as preconditions to later investments.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall review projects proposed for consideration in a Compact program to support MCC in initial assessment of the proposals. The Contractor shall document the project logic (with associated risks and assumptions) and description, maps, project schematics, technical specifications, standards, accuracy of cost estimates,  and level of economic and financial analysis performed to date.</p>
<p>For policy, capacity building, or technical assistance related projects, the Contractor shall link the proposal to existing sector studies, including the MCC transport sector due diligence analysis underway, and identify the level of scope definition, including requirements (in terms of actions, stakeholder involvement, and cost), and likely impact. For all project proposals, the Contractor shall identify gaps in project definition and provide an early indication of project feasibility, given Compact time and budget constraints.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide a clear and detailed description of the proposed projects, including an indexed summary of conclusions from previous studies that could be relevant to this proposal, especially if these studies were completed recently. The description shall include the following:</p>

<p>8.	Validate existing and/or develop new cost estimates. Examine the methodology for cost estimation, and review unit rates employed and quantities used in calculations. Ensure that costs reflect current industry Contractor prices, material availability due to world demand, and inflation factors, and recheck country- specific unit costs employed in standard costing methods. Investigate whether all associated (and reasonable) cost estimates - such as costs relating to environmental and social inclusion management plans, resettlement compensation, construction supervision, project management - are included. If they are not, estimate these costs and advise MCC accordingly. Cost estimates shall take into consideration similar, recent contracts, regional price variations (if any), and competition.</p>
<p>9.	Evaluate budget contingency requirements. Review and revise/develop, as necessary, existing cost estimates in accordance with MCC guidelines, to reflect changes to design standards and specifications, sufficient price and physical contingencies, provision for foreign exchange effects, optimism in cost estimation, inflationary factors, etc.</p>
<p>10.	Analyze required timelines for implementation and timeline risks (e.g., because of construction delays, or the requirement of prior policy and/or institutional changes).</p>
<p>Regulatory, Policy, and Institutional Assessment</p>
<p>The Contractor shall assess each project within the context of the current policy, regulatory, legal and institutional arrangements in the transport sector and highlight reforms needed to support the particular investment. Included will be an appraisal of the proposed project relative to key institutions' operational, management and governance practices, and their technical capacity. From this, the Contractor shall identify any gaps or risks that may prevent the project from yielding intended benefits and highlight the potential impact on sustainability of the potential MCC investment and the sector overall. The Contractor shall assess proposed policy and institutional capacity building investments and technical assistance for their potential to address such concerns, and make corresponding recommendations.</p>

<p>5.	In the context of due diligence work, comment on existing data management systems, communication and control procedures, roles and responsibilities of all relevant actors for all the projects and corresponding activities. Depict clearly the data flow chart.</p>
<p>In the context of due diligence work, identify capacity needs of GOPH for data collection, quality, and management within the relevant implementing entities and make recommendations for possible improvements.</p>
<p>It is expected that the Contractor shall fulfill the aforementioned M&amp;E requirements in the context of project design or feasibility work, rather than as a separate or unrelated exercise.</p>
<p>Assist MCC to assess the quality of data based on the following principles:</p>
<p>1.	Validity: Are the indicators defined well and are data reported in an appropriate format?  Are formulas used correct?  Do the indicators accurately represent reality?  Do they have a verifiable source?  Is all necessary data present?  Can indicators be disaggregated by age, gender, caste and ethnic groups, location and income level?</p>
<p>2.	Reliability: Do data values give conflicting information?  Is there:</p>
<p>a.	Measurement Error (for surveys only): Were the questions in the survey/questionnaire clear, direct, and easy to understand?  Was an appropriate sampling frame used?  Were enumerators well-trained?</p>
<p>b.	Transcription Error: Is there a process to limit transcription error?  Have data errors been tracked to their original source and mistakes corrected?</p>
<p>c.	Consistency: Is the data gathering process (including instrument and sampling process) the same over time and across projects/regions?  Are the data internally consistent (totals equal sum of parts, etc.)?</p>
<p>d.	Quality Control: What are the procedures (data collection, maintenance and process) to guard against bias? Are procedures reviewed periodically?  Are there random checks at each stage?</p>
<p>e.	Transparency: Are the procedures in writing and are problems reported?</p>
<p>f.	Timeliness: Are data collected and reported as regularly as is relevant?  Are reported data the most recent? Is the date of data collection clearly identified?</p>
<p>g.	Precision: Is the margin of error reported?  Is the margin of error less than the expected change in the indicator? Is the margin of error acceptable for decision-making, given cost/benefit?  Does the target include margin of error?</p>
<p>h.	Integrity: Are data subject to political and/or personal manipulation?  Are there appropriate control procedures and reviews in place?  Is there independence in key data collection, management and assessment?  Is there an impartial review of the entire data gathering process?  Is there integrity (between records)?  How well is the MCA as a whole working to support result reporting?</p>

<p>MCC/Security's decision to grant an interim or final security clearance to a PSC candidate will be communicated via the STARS Sharepoint New Hires database and CGM will communicate the requirement for each PSC candidate to attend MCC's Orientation Program, which takes place on alternating Mondays at the start of each pay period.  All PSC candidates who require on-site facility access and/or MCCNet access are required to attend MCC's Orientation Program which includes a Security Briefing, a badging appointment and an IT Briefing.  After attending MCC's Orientation Program, MCC/Security will issue an HSPD-12 compliant MCC Photo ID Badge which will permit the PSC candidate with physical site access to MCC headquarters and will indicate on the face of the badge, the PSC candidate's status and level of security clearance granted.</p>
<p>2.	Secure Contract Classification.  Classified contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements with organizations must comply with the National Industrial Security Program (NISP).  Under the provisions of NISP, the Defense Security Service (DSS) will investigate and adjudicate security clearances required for contractor employees to have access to classified information.  Organizations (contractors and recipients) and their employees not currently participating in NISP which much conduct classified business with MCC must be sponsored by MCC, another agency, or by company that has been previously cleared.  Once the secure contract is awarded, MCC Contracting Officer, in consultation with MCC/Security, will be responsible for completing the Department of Defense Contract Security Classification Specification, DD Form 254.</p>
<p>D.	Exceptions to Investigations Requirements</p>
<p>Contractor candidates are exempt from investigative requirements when working in temporary Low Risk Public Trust (LRPT) positions that are intermittent and when not working on an MCC contract in excess of 180 days in either a single continuous assignment or a series of assignments within a 365 day period.  LRPT positions involve duties and responsibilities of limited impact on an agency or program mission, with potential for limited impact on the efficiency of the service.  Persons occupying these positions will not have unescorted access to the Department of State or its Embassies, Sensitive But Unclassified, Foreign Government Information, MCC-Sensitive information, or require logon access to MCC's computer information network.</p>
<p>Contractor candidates are exempt from investigative requirements when working in a part-time Moderate Risk Public Trust (MRPT) position, as defined in Section 4.18.2 of MCC's Background Investigations and Clearances policy:</p>
<p>Moderate Risk Public Trust (MRPT) Position:  Public trust positions in which an incumbent has the potential to have a moderate to serious impact on the integrity and efficiency of the service.  Duties involved are considerably important to the agency or program mission with significant program responsibility or delivery of service.  Positions include assistants to policy development and implementation; mid-level management duties or assignments; any position with responsibility for independent or semi-independent action; and delivery of service positions that demand public confidence or trust.  At this time, MCC staffing of contractor and intern positions are all MRPT positions.</p>
<p>In addition, no part-time MCC MRPT contractor positions may exceed an aggregate of 1,200 hours within a 365 day period in either a single continuous appointment or series of appointments.  If a contractor has not been investigated and has not been granted a facility access clearance by MCC/Security and the contractor's compensated hours approach 1,150 within a 365 day period, the contractor's hours must be closely monitored by contracting officer and COR so as not to exceed 1,200 hours.  MCC will not be required to compensate any individual who has not been investigated and who has not been granted a clearance by MCC/Security for hours in excess of 1,200 hours.  If work is required in excess of 1,200 hours, the work assignment must be re-advertised and all candidates must re-compete for any additional assignments not to exceed 1,200 hours within another 365 day period.</p>
<p>E.	Issuing MCC Access Badges</p>
<p>A Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) compliant MCC Photo ID Badge Federal credential (badge) will be issued to contractors, Personal Services Contractors and Personal Services Contractor-FTEs with a permanent duty station assignment at MCC Headquarters or at an overseas MCC/Resident Country Director Office.  Requirements before being issued a badge include submission of required background investigation forms for processing a facility access for a contractor of PSC or a security clearance for a PSC and mandatory attendance at an MCC Orientation Program/Security Briefing which are scheduled on the first business day of the pay period and alternate weeks as determined by MCC's Human Resources Division, and are generally held from 8:45 to 10:00 am, immediately followed by an IT Briefing.  In addition, all PSCs whose position has been determined as one which requires access to classified information and whose investigation is sufficient to meet that requirement must attend an MCC/Security Clearance Briefing prior to being granted a security clearance and issued a badge.  Due to HSPD-12, visitor badges are no longer available and all newly hired contractors, and PSC-s will require assistance from co-workers until their badge is issued by MCC/Security.</p>
<p>Contractors and PSCs who have undergone a background investigation (or who are in the process of undergoing a background investigation) and who are U.S. citizens may be eligible for 24/7 access to MCC headquarters.  All non-U.S. citizen foreign nationals, who hold Permanent Resident Status, who have undergone a background investigation (or who are in the process of undergoing a background investigation) will only be provided unescorted access during regular business hours (Monday through Friday, 7:30 am to 6:30 pm, excluding Federal holidays and other U.S. government closings).<br />Contractor and PSC candidates who have not submitted the required background investigation forms and attended the required MCC/Security Briefing(s) will not be issued a badge nor building access cards and their access to MCC headquarters will require them to have an appointment which is documented in MCC's Workspeed Access Control System and must be escorted at all times while in MCC headquarters</p>
<p>F.	Work Performance</p>
<p>The contractor shall prescreen all candidates covered under this clause to ensure they initially possess the necessary investigative and clearance requirements.  In addition, the contractor is responsible to periodically, at least annually, review their employees' clearance status to ensure that nothing has occurred which may  negatively impact their employees' eligibility for a clearance.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise provided, herein in no event will the need to process background investigations and clearances (including physical on-site access at MCC facilities) from MCC/Security be considered an excusable delay under the contract.  In addition, the need to replace contract personnel determined by the MCC/Security to be ineligible will not be considered an excusable delay.</p>
<p>Failure to comply with the contractor personnel background investigation and clearance requirements herein may result in termination of the contract for default.</p>
<p>G.	Contract Award</p>
<p>Within two (2) business days after notice of award from the contracting officer, contractor shall provide a list of all contractor candidates (and subcontractor candidates) working under the contract (unless otherwise stated in the contract) including the information and documentation required herein.  This requirement does not include clerical or administrative support staff (unless otherwise stated in the contract).</p>
<p>The list shall include individual's full name, work and home addresses, work and personal e-mail addresses, work and personal telephone numbers and personal cell telephone numbers.  This list shall state and justify the level of access each contractor candidate will require; that is, MCC facility access, access to non-classified sensitive information, MCCNet access, or no access privileges.  In addition, the contractor will provide a central point-of-contact regarding background investigation and clearance issues.  If the contractor has documentation which evidences an individual contractor candidate's previous/current background investigation and/or clearance status, the contractor will provide the individual contractor candidate's PII and investigations/clearance status to MCC/Security via fax to 202-521-3590 in the form of a Visit Letter.  Upon a request from the contractor, a sample Visit Letter template will be made available to a contractor via e-mail from MCC/Security.  The contracting officer will ensure that a STARS Sharepoint New Hires entry is made for each contractor candidate to ensure that MCC/Security is aware of future on-boarding of each contractor candidate.  The contracting officer or COR is responsible to provide MCC/Security's Personal Information Request Form to the contractor with instructions to have each contractor candidate complete, sign and fax to MCC/Security at 202-521-3590 so that their background investigation and clearance process can begin.  All involved should be cautioned that the completed and signed Personal Information Request Form not be scanned/e-mailed to anyone at MCC.  Once the Personal Information Request Form has been provided to the contractor and/or contractor candidate, it is the contractor's responsibility to assure that the Personal Information Request Form is faxed to MCC/Security at 202-521-3590 within three (3) business days.  Once the Personal Information Request Form is received by MCC/Security, the individual contractor candidate's eligibility for a clearance will be determined within three (3) business days.  If a contractor candidate does not have a previous background investigation and clearance, MCC/Security will initiate an e-QIP and e-mail instructions to the contractor candidate to complete the investigative requirements (including fingerprinting) within seven (7) calendar days.</p>

<p>H.7.	MCC 52.232-73 Travel Reimbursement (May 2013)</p>
<p>Policy.  When authorized as part of the Scope of Work on this contract/order and within the contract/order ceiling and as approved by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and/or other MCC officials as described below, travel expenses incurred in performance of technical directives issued under this contractor/order may be reimbursed as allowed by the Federal Travel Regulations (FTR) in effect at the time of travel.  MCC's supplemental policy interpretations are derived from the FTR and cannot grant additional benefits or adjust processes defined in the FTR.  Supplemental policies of MCC set forth below:</p>
<p>a.	Traveler Responsibilities.  All contractor travelers must:<br />1.	Exercise the same care in incurring expenses that a prudent person would exercise if traveling on personal business;<br />2.	Travel in accordance with the FTR and the MCC policies included in this document; and<br />3.	Pay any charges or fees associated with non-compliance of FTR or any MCC policies included in this document, and any expenses incurred for personal convenience.  For example, the traveler may become personally responsible for travel costs associated with unauthorized use of other than coach class accommodations, failing to follow the Fly American Act requirements, exceeding per diem rates, changing departure or return flights, purchasing unapproved items, etc. regardless of the fact that travel arrangements may have been booked by others (e.g., Travel Agency).</p>
<p>b.	Cabin Class Standards<br />1.	The standard cabin class for contractor air-travel is coach class, regardless of destination or travel time.<br />2.	Coach "premium" class may be authorized for destinations which have a travel time of more than 14 hours, consistent with the Federal Travel Regulations and the approval standards outlined in paragraph (f) of this document.<br />3.	Business class travel accommodations will NOT be authorized except as determined through the approval process outlined in paragraph (f) of this document.  This approval process is considered to be exceptional, to be part of a trip by trip analysis, and at the discretion of the government regardless of the destination or travel time.</p>
<p>c.	Airlines and Flights.  In accordance with the Fly America Act, contractors must use a U.S. flag air carrier service for all travel funded by the government beginning or ending in the U.S. unless a specific exemption to the "Fly America" rule applies.  Flights on U.S. air carrier pairings with foreign carriers (i.e., code share flights) are regarded as meeting Fly America requirements if the ticket is issued on the American carrier and there is an American carrier flight number.</p>
<p>d.	Limitations.  Travel reimbursement, which is part of ODC, shall not exceed the authorized ODC amount on the contract.  To be reimbursable, the travel expenses must be:<br />1.	Allowable under the FTR and the provisions of this contract/order and associated technical directives;<br />2.	Approved prior to travel expenditure by the COR; and<br />3.	Allocable and necessary for performance of this contract/order and associated technical directives.</p>
<p>e.	Reimbursement Requests.  Travel reimbursement requests must be submitted in sufficient time for the COR to give prior approval, and must identify:<br />1.	The name of the traveler,<br />2.	Destination (s) including itinerary,<br />3.	Purpose of the travel, and<br />4.	Cost breakdown.<br />To be reimbursed, invoices including travel expenses must provide a detailed breakdown of the actual expenditures invoiced.  Contractor shall maintain the original or legible copy of receipts for all travel expenses invoiced when the expenditure is $75.00 or more.  MCC reserves the right to request evidence of any travel expense paid.</p>
<p>f.	Approvals.  All travel expenses, including rental cars, must be approved by the MCC COR in writing in advance of booking any travel and incurring travel expenses.  The following expense types require additional MCC pre-approvals beyond that of the COR.  These additional approvals and associated justifications will be documented in writing:</p>
<p>1.	Business class<br />Business class travel is considered to be exceptional, to be determined as part of a trip by trip analysis, and at the discretion of the government regardless of the destination or travel time.  To reflect the exceptional nature of this approval, the justification for use of business class must be prepared by the COR and approved in writing by the relevant Managing Director or Deputy Vice President of the organization requesting the contractor to travel.  The single exception to requiring this justification and approval for every trip in question is when a State Department approved medical accommodation has been granted.  In this case, the approval of the COR and the Contracting Officer only is required after verifying that the medical accommodation is effective for the trip in question and that sufficient funds are available.  All justifications must verify that the contractor is required to report for duty the following day or sooner, that the travel time for the trip is at least 14 hours, and that a rest stop will not be taken en route.  For audit purposes, all justifications and approvals to this effect must be retained by the COR and the contractor until contract closeout at which point all documentation must be provided to the Contracting Officer for incorporation in the contract file.  Below are possible justifications supporting these exceptional requests:</p>
<p>A.	Medical accommodation.  MCC has engaged the services of the U.S. Department of State's Office of Medical Services (MED/DP) for adjudication on requests for medical accommodations due to disability.  MCC will facilitate this process but will not adjudicate disputes or appeals in connection with these requests.  If the Department of State's policies for reviewing these requests changes, MCC will be responsible for notifying contractors of the change but will not be responsible for providing an alternative for medical accommodation requests.  For detailed procedures see Attachment: Medical Accommodation Procedures.<br />B.	Sanitation/Health.  Coach accommodation on an authorized/approved foreign air carrier do not provide adequate sanitation or health standards.<br />C.	Savings.  Flying in non-coach status would involve significant cost savings to MCC when compared to the lowest price non-refundable or restricted coach class fare.<br />D.	Availability.  No space is available in coach-class accommodations in time to accomplish the mission, which is urgent and cannot be postponed.  (Note:  This justification should not be used based on the lack of advanced planning by the contractor or the COR).<br />E.	Security.  Exceptional security circumstances require other than coach-class airline accommodations.<br />F.	Mission critical agency requirement.  Circumstances in which a critical agency priority or project will incur delay or degradation without the intervention of a contractor and that intervention urgently requires other than coach class ticketing.</p>
<p>2.	Coach "premium" class must be approved by the COR, subject to the availability of funds on the contract/order, and:<br />A.	The origin and/or destination are OCONUS;<br />B.	The scheduled flight time including non-overnight stopovers and change of planes, is in excess of 14 hours.  Scheduled flight time is the flight time between the originating departure point and the ultimate arrival point including scheduled non-overnight time spent at airports during plane changes.  Scheduled non-overnight time does not include time spent at the originating or ultimate arrival airports;<br />C.	The contractor is required to report to duty the following day or sooner; and<br />D.	The contractor does not take a rest stop en route or a rest period upon arrival at the duty site.</p>
<p>3.	Rest stops must be approved by the COR and cannot exceed 24 hours.</p>
<p>Note:  Travelers may upgrade flight accommodations at their own expense or through the use of frequent flyer miles if the coach airfare is upgradeable at no extra cost to MCC.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>H.8.	MCC 52.232-74 ODC Reimbursement (Jan 2007)</p>
<p>Other Direct Charges (ODCs) will be reimbursed for direct costs as provided in the contract and/or task order.  To be reimbursed, invoices including ODCs, must provide a detailed breakdown of the actual expenditures invoiced.  The contractor shall maintain the original or legible copy of receipts for all ODCs invoiced.  MCC reserves the right to request evidence of any ODC reimbursed.  To assure timely reimbursement of ODC's, the contractor is strongly encouraged to submit charges within 45 days of the expense.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>H.9.	MCC 52.242-70 Contractor Performance Assessment Rating System (CPARS) Registration (Aug 2011)</p>
<p>The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) utilizes the Contractor Performance Assessment Rating System (CPARS) to evaluate contractor performance (see FAR, Subparts 42.1502 and 42.1503).  Contractors doing business with MCC are required to register in CPARS accessible via the Internet at:  http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/cparsmain.htm.  An evaluation of contractor performance using the CPARS is mandatory for all contract actions exceeding $150,000, but may be conducted for contract actions lower than that amount should significant events occur such as a contract termination or extraordinary contract performance by the contractor.  Inquiries regarding the registration process should be addressed to the CPARS help desk.  The email address is WEBPTSMH@NAVY.MIL  and the telephone number is (207) 438-1690.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>H.10.	MCC 52.243-70 Increase in Services (Oct 2006)</p>
<p>The services described in Sections B and C (Statement of Work) represent the Government's best estimate for known requirements at this time.  However, due to the uncertainty of the work, the Government reserves the right to add or delete services if the need arises.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>H.11.	MCC 52.245-70 Contractor Acquired MCC Government Property Overseas (July 2012)</p>
<p>Property and equipment (hereafter stated "property") that MCC Contractors (other than Personnel Service Contractors) acquire and for which they receive MCC reimbursement through the invoice process is Government (MCC) owned property.  Government property is to be used, monitored, and inventoried in accordance with FAR Part 45, Subpart 45.5 Management of Government Property in the Possession of Contractors, as well as MCC Policy 350, "Policies and procedures on Property, Plant, and Equipment."  The contractor should start a running property inventory as soon as it begins to procure property and equipment the cost of which is charged back to the Government.  The Contractor shall furnish a copy of such inventory to the COR semi-annually or at least as the contract is in its final stages of completion if its duration does not exceed six months.  Mandatory fields on the inventory include:  The Contractor's Name; the Contractor Number; the Country Location and address location; a description of the item with model number serial number, and manufacturer; the acquisition date and cost; the Quantity; the expected life; and its condition at the time of the report.  The contractor is responsible for removing US Government identification from property that is to be abandoned.</p>
<p>(End of Clause)</p>
<p>H.12.	Additional Labor Categories</p>
<p>During the performance of this call order, it may become desirable to add new labor categories. In such cases, the Government may identify additional labor categories and the Contractor shall, in good faith, negotiate the hourly rates for the categories. Upon completion of such negotiation, the call order shall be modified to add the new categories and negotiated rate.</p>
<p>H.13.	Government Data supplied to the Contractor</p>
<p>During the course of this call order, the Contractor will have access to Government data relevant to this project, as may be required. Any information not previously published, received from the Government in connection with this call order, or furnished to the Contractor from other sources in response to the Government's requirements under this call order, will be restricted to this contractor and may not be disclosed or used for any other purpose, without the prior written approval of the Contracting Officer. These restrictions do not apply to information that:<br />1. Currently or subsequently enters the public domain (except by disclosure by the Contractor);<br />2. Has been released to any third party without restrictions; or<br />3. Is obtained by the Contractor independent of the Government.</p>

<p>2.	The Government will evaluate quotes in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in Section M of the RFQ.</p>
<p>3.	Offerors must submit their quotes in the following format and the quantities specified:</p>
<p>a.	COVER LETTER. Submitted via email to Andrew Lee as specified in L.2.2 above. The Cover Letter must be signed by an individual authorized to commit the company to the quote.

<p>L.2.4.	Blocked and Unacceptable Electronic File Types</p>
<p>Offerors are advised that due to current cybersecurity threats, MCC currently blocks attachments containing extensions that run programs.  These include any files that contain or are executables, macros, and other extensions that present a threat.  As such Offeror, must not use any of these file extensions and remove all macros from Microsoft Office documents (Word, Excel) or their quote/proposal will be blocked, preventing receipt of the quote/proposal by MCC and potentially preventing the Offeror from being considered for award.</p>
<p>The following are examples of file types that are blocked, however this list is not exhaustive or fully-inclusive as additional, similar file types may be blocked in the future:</p>
<p>.vbs (Microsoft Visual Basic script file)<br />.vbe (VBScript encoded script file)<br />.scr (script)<br />.reg (registration file)<br />.jar (java file extension)<br />.exe (executable)<br />.docm (Word with macros)<br />.xlsm (Excel with macros)<br />.pptm (PowerPoint with macros)<br />.app (executable)<br />.ani (animation files)<br />.ace (data compression archive file format used by WinAce)<br />.ico (image file format)<br />.js (java script)<br />.zip (compression file)</p>
<p>L.2.5.	Quote Content and Submission Instructions</p>
<p>The quotes should clearly demonstrate the Contractor's understanding of the technical requirements of the Statement of Work (SoW). A failure to convey the Contractor's ability to meet all the Government's requirements may result in the Contractor's quote not being considered for award. Clarity and completeness of quotes are of the utmost importance. Therefore, quotes must be written in a practical, clear, and concise manner.</p>
<p>The narrative must provide the Government with a reasonable assurance that the company has the relevant experience, capacity, and capability required to fully satisfy the Government's requirements. A restatement of the SoW will be deemed unacceptable and may result in a low technical rating.</p>

<p>Award evaluations will be conducted in accordance with FAR 13.106-2. A BPA call order will be awarded to the Offeror whose quote represents the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>M.1.	Basis of Award</p>
<p>The Government intends to award one (1) call order on a best value basis to the Offeror that is determined to be the most advantageous to the Government. Offerors are cautioned that an award may not necessarily be made to the lowest priced Offeror. However, if non-price factors are evaluated as comparatively equal between two or more Offerors, price may become a determinative factor. The Government reserves the right to award without discussion; therefore, it is incumbent upon all Offerors to submit their best quote.</p>
<p>M.2.	Evaluation Factors and Sub-factors</p>
<p>All quotes will be evaluated based on the evaluation factors listed below.</p>
<p>The following evaluation factors and sub-factors are listed in descending order of importance, starting with the most important: (1) Technical Capability, (2) Past Performance, and (3) Price.</p>
<p>Factor 1: Technical Capability</p>
<p>1: Firm's Overall Capability, Sector Experience, and Technical Approach</p>
<p>MCC will evaluate Offeror's demonstrated technical capability, clear technical approach, and realistic workplan on how it will achieve the deliverables.</p>
<p>MCC will evaluate the Offeror's comprehensive technical approach and demonstrated understanding of the challenges/problems of potential tasks involved. MCC will also evaluate the Offeror's quality assurance approach and methods for performing the tasks.</p>
<p>MCC will evaluate the Offeror's firm evidence and clear demonstration of the understanding of the requirements for quality work and deliverables, including appropriateness of style, grammatical correctness, and data integrity relative to the writing necessary for the project.</p>
<p>2: Management and Team Structure</p>
<p>MCC will evaluate the Offeror's comprehensiveness of the management and team structure as well as the proposed staffing plan. MCC will also evaluate the availability of resources, ability to timely deploy resources, ensure appropriate level of quality assurance and control, and ability to successfully perform relevant project to ensure successful execution of the task. MCC may request a 30-minute oral presentation by the team leaders to better understand the structure of the team and its ability to meet the satisfy MCC's requirements. MCC will evaluate the rationale for the proposed team members to meet the objectives outlined under the SoW.</p>
<p>3: Key and Non-Key Personnel Qualifications</p>
<p>MCC will evaluate resumes of key and non-key (core) personnel proposed in accordance with Subsection H.1 Personnel. Each Personnel will also be considered for satisfactory performance and exhibiting in-depth regional knowledge.</p>
<p>Factor 2: Past Performance</p>
<p>Firms will be evaluated on their performance under existing and prior contracts for urban transport, planning and land development during the past three (3) years in developing countries. The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality performance relative to the size and complexity of the requirement under consideration.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to consider information from any other sources when evaluating the Offeror's past performance.</p>
<p>Factor 3: Price</p>
<p>The Government will examine price quotes for reasonableness and completeness.  Offerors are requested and encouraged to provide any discounted pricing.</p>
<p>Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests, the Government will evaluate Quotes for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. This includes options under FAR clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, which applies to this solicitation. Evaluation of options under FAR 52.217-8 will be accomplished by using the prices offered for the last option period to determine the price for a 6-month option period, which will be added to the base and other option years to arrive at the total price. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>M.3.	Evaluation Methodology</p>
<p>A call order will be awarded to the Offeror whose quotes conform to the requirements outlined in this RFQ and are most advantageous to the Government based on the best value determination. The Government will perform a comparative analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of each quote as related to the Evaluation Factors above.</p>
<p>In terms of relative weights, the Technical Capability is more important than the Past Performance or the Price factor individually, but less important than the Past Performance and the Price factors combined. The Past Performance and the Price factors are listed in descending order of importance above.</p>
<p>The potential risk to the Government will also be evaluated. The technical and performance risk, based on the Offeror's evaluated technical capability and past performance, will be considered during the evaluation as well as any possible pricing risk. Throughout the evaluation, the Government may consider "correction potential" when a deficiency is identified.</p>

The project site is located in downtown Greenville, SC at the southeast corner of the intersection of East North Street and North Spring Street.</p>
<p align="left">Site size is approximately 1.97 acres. Due to the size and complexity of the work, the best procurement method is full and open competition.

<p align="left">In accordance FAR Subpart 15.305, the Contracting Officer will determine which proposals are within the competitive range based on the evaluated price and the non price evaluation factors included in the RFP. The Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). Total Evaluated Price shall be calculated using the prices indicated on the Price Schedule.</p>
<strong>
<p align="left">Bond Requirements</p>
</strong>
<p align="left">A bid guarantee will be required 90 days prior to the exercise of the Construction Option. The option award will require performance and payment bonds as specified in the Agreement.</p>
