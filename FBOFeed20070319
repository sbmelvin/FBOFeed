<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE, for executive training advisory and assistance service for the Director, Orlando VA Medical Center, 5201 Raymond Street, Orlando, Florida.  This proposed acquisition was formerly advertised in a Sources Sought notice dated 21 Feb 2007.  Period of performance is estimated 12 months.  Background:  A requirement exists in the Department of Veterans' Affairs, Veterans Health Administration VISN 8 for a contractor to perform executive training advisory and assistance services for the Director, Orlando VA Medical Center.  This requirement is critical to the success of the VA because the Orlando facility was elevated from VA Outpatient Clinic status to that of an independent VA Medical Center effective October 1, 2006.  With this change in status, functions previously handled by the James A. Haley Veterans’ Hospital in Tampa and the North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Health System (Gainesville and Lake City) are being transferred to the Orlando VA Medical Center.  Additionally, a site selection process is underway that will determine the location for the construction of a new VA medical center in Orlando.  The Director will oversee the activation process of this new facility.  Objectives and deliverables:  The objective of this service is an individual development plan (IDP) for the Director.  The IDP will serve as a “road map” for the performance of the contract or task order.  The contractor will provide advisory assistance regarding ad-hoc management and ethical dilemmas that may arise.  Generally, meetings will be conducted in concert with the VA’s Monthly Orlando Steering Committee meetings.  At the conclusion of the contract or task order, a long-term individual development plan will be completed.

The Baseline Assessment will consist of (1) a summary of the initial meeting, (2) an initial identification of the strengths and weaknesses of the Director, (3) a recommended reading list, and (4) an individual development plan for the Director that will incorporate a prioritized list of action items with an accompanying timeline that are to be completed during the POP.  3.  A Monthly Assessment will be submitted within 14 calendar days of end of each month during the POP, whenever a Quarterly Assessment is not due.  4.  The Monthly Assessment will consist of (1) a summary of the activities undertaken by the contractor during that month, (2) an identification of improvements in the previously identified strengths and weaknesses of the Director, (3) progress made on the recommended reading list, and (4) progress made on the individual development plan for the Director.  5.  A Quarterly Assessment will be submitted within 14 calendar days of the end of every third month in the POP (the approximate days from the start of the POP are 90, 180, 270, and 365).  6.  The Quarterly Assessment will consist of (1) a summary of the activities undertaken during that quarter, (2) an identification of improvements in the previously identified strengths and weaknesses of the Director, (3) progress made on the recommended reading list, and (4) progress made on the individual development plan for the Director.  7.  A final Assessment will be submitted within 14 calendar days of the final meeting with the Director.  8.  The Final Assessment will consist of (1) an overall summary of the activities undertaken during the POP, (2) an identification of improvements in the previously identified strengths and weaknesses of the Director with special emphasis on significant improvements and areas in which improvement is still needed, (3) progress made on the recommended reading list with an identification of a recommended recurring reading list, (4) an evaluation of the progress made on the individual development plan, (5) a new long-term individual development plan for the Director, and (6) an overall evaluation assessment of the Director.

Completion of background investigations will be required prior to contractor employee(s) beginning work.

<DESC>OFFICE SPACE WANTED BY
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT


The General Services Administration currently leases 81,480 BOMA rentable square feet (69,258 usable sq. feet) of office space with 29 on-site parking spaces at 606 S. Olive Street in downtown Los Angeles.  The space is occupied by the U.S. Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS). EOIR occupies 56,441 rentable sq. feet (47,975 usable sf); DHS occupies 25,039 rentable (21,283 usable) sq. feet.  

GSA intends to negotiate a superseding lease at this location and increase the square footage.  The proposed lease term would incorporate the remainder of the current lease term, which runs through late October 2009, plus another 5 years.  The new requirement will increase to approximately 70,000 rsf for EOIR and 30,640 rsf for DHS (based on a 17.65% building load factor).  

GSA will consider other buildings that can provide this total requirement provided they meet the criteria in this announcement and can prove overall cost effectiveness when considering relocation costs of furniture and communications (data and voice), tenant improvements and other factors. The total rentable space must yield approximately 88,760 usable square feet  for use by government personnel, furnishings and equipment – 61,975 usf for EOIR and 26,185 usf for DHS.  Floor plates must have potential for efficient space layout. A variety of inexpensive and moderately priced fast food and/or eat-in restaurants must be located within three blocks as well as other amenities such as retail shops, cleaners, banks, etc. must also be available within one-quarter mile.

In order to evaluate the total costs to the Government, competing offers should include 
an improvement allowance of $37.75 per usable sq. foot for duplicating existing office space for the DHS and EOIR office areas, and $70.00 per sq. foot for constructing each of the 32 courtrooms EOIR requires (each courtroom measures approx. 600 sq. feet).  In addition, moving costs of $5.00 per usable sq. foot will be added to competing offers.  

Buildings offered must be of sound and substantial construction of the type generally recognized as modern office having adequate means of ingress and egress; must fully meet the accessibility requirements of the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standard (ABAAS); must be altered or constructed to meet the government’s requirement, and must be fully serviced.  The building must also conform to the seismic requirements for new construction or the current edition of the Uniform Building Code if the lateral load resisting system is of concrete, masonry or steel composition. The buildings offered must not contain sprayed-on fireproofing or acoustical treatment containing asbestos.

LOCATION:  Offered properties must be located in the City of Los Angeles, California bounded by:

	North:	3rd Street;
	West:  	110 Freeway;
	East:	Broadway;
	South:	Olympic Blvd.


	
PROPOSED LEASE TERM:  Through October 2014.
 
Forward pertinent information by Friday, March 30, 2007 before 4:00 p.m. PDT:

		GSA Real Estate Services Branch
		Attn:  Royal Cochran
		300 N. Los Angeles St., Suite 2300

<DESC>Raytheon Technical Services Company LLC, Polar Services, (RPSC) will be soliciting proposals towards securing a charter for an ice capable Antarctic Research and Supply Vessel (ARSV) to operate in the Southern Ocean around the Antarctic Peninsula and other locations in support of the United States Antarctic Program (USAP).

RPSC presently charters and provides science support staffing on the R/V LAURENCE M. GOULD and the R/V NATHANIEL B. PALMER for the National Science Foundation (NSF), an agency of the United States Government.  On behalf of the NSF RPSC is pursuing the charter of a vessel to meet the oceanographic and logistics support requirements of the USAP.  The vessel is to be chartered for a period of five (5) years with options for another five (5) years.  The purpose of this announcement is to seek interested parties in industry capable of supplying a vessel to continue to provide services currently supported by the R/V LAURENCE M. GOULD.  RPSC will be seeking proposals that include the building of a new ship or the reconditioning of an existing similar classed vessel.  For reference purposes only, information regarding the GOULD may be found under Vessel Science and Operations at http://www.usap.gov/. 

The vessel will be required to operate frequently in the often extremely stormy waters south of Cape Horn in the Drake Passage with regular operations south of 60 degrees South Latitude and in sea ice to support oceanographic research and USAP logistics for Palmer Station and other field locations.  The vessel must be seaworthy, fully found, appropriately classed, be able to provide a stable platform from which to conduct scientific research and comfortable enough to safely support personnel at sea for extended periods.  Such remote operations necessarily require a reliable and well fitted vessel.  Operations in support of scientific research and the requirement to re-supply and carry personnel to Palmer Station will be of equal importance within the technical requirements of the Request for proposal (RFP).

It is anticipated that an RFP will be issued in June 2007.  To receive the full RFP, industry is requested to provide “Letters of Interest” by 1 May 2007 to:

Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101 (10 AUG 2005) the following applies:

(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. 

(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMBC A-76 competition performance decisions).

<SOLNBR>FA8625-07-R-64573
<RESPDATE>040207
<ARCHDATE>04302007
<CONTACT>LaToya Brown, 937-255-2454
<DESC>This announcement is an update to a synopsis posted on 7 Dec 2006, Referenced as solicitation number FA8625-07-R-6473. The 716th Aeronautical Systems Group (716 AESG) intends to award a sole  source contract to Lockheed Martin Aeronautics for Large Aircraft Infrared  Countermeasure (LAIRCM) Group A, spares for Group A hardware, Group A  interim contractor support (ICS), C-5 LAIRCM Group A/B kit assembly,  LAIRCM Kit installation, and associated over and above for the C-5B  LAIRCM.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or  a limited number of sources, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 -- Only  One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy  Agency Requirements.  This requirement will not be set-aside for small  business and will be covered under NAICS code 334511. A production and installation contract will be awarded in April 2007 for  Group A manufacture, and spares, for FY07 with annual (unpriced) options  for FY08-11, Group A/B kit assembly for FY08 with annual (unpriced)  options for FY09-12, Group A support for FY08 with annual (unpriced)  options for FY09-10, and Group A/B kit /installation for FY08 and Over and  Above associated with the installations acquired as necessary during the  course of the installation period.  This effort is currently funded for 21  aircraft; the number of aircraft per lot will be based on variable  quantities of one to six aircraft. Group B will be furnished by the  Government as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).   The anticipated lot  profile is five Group A kits in Lot I (FY 07); five in Lot II (FY08); six  in Lot III (FY09); four in Lot IV (FY10); and one in Lot V (FY11). If  additional funding becomes available, effort for up to a total of 24  aircraft may be purchased. LMA is the developer of the C-5 LAIRCM Group A, and the development effort  will still be under way at the time of the planned Apr 07 contract award.  In order to manufacture Group A another source would require knowledge of  or access to LMA proprietary internal specifications and standards.  The  LAIRCM system must integrate with all systems, subsystems, and components  of the C-5 aircraft.  LAIRCM must be installed in the aircraft without any  degradation of performance of the aircraft.  LMA, the original  manufacturer of the C-5 aircraft, is the prime contractor for both the C-5  AMP and Reliability Enhancement and Re-Engining Program. Both these  modernization programs must be considered in the design, fabrication, and  integration of the Group A and B kits. The installation Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO), which would be  required by another potential contractor to bid on and accomplish the FY08  C-5 LAIRCM installations, will not be available at the time of contract  award and installation of the first lot of aircraft.  Lockheed Martin  Integrated Systems, who is on contract (F09603-01-D-0207-0115) to develop  the initial Group A kit and install Group A/B kit in the first aircraft,  will deliver the necessary installation TCTO in March 2008.  The  Government will verify the TCTO with the first FY08 (Lot I) aircraft  installation.  A decision will be made in FY 08 about whether to  accomplish installation of future lots organically or via a competitively  awarded contract. Because the Government plans to issue a sole source solicitation,  FA8625-07-R-6473, an additional synopsis will not be issued.  The  approximate issue date of the solicitation will be 30 March 2007.   The  approximate response date of the solicitation will be 30 April 2007.  This  notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. For additional information please contract LaToya Brown at Aeronautical  Systems Center, Wright Patterson Air Force Base, ATTN: LaToya Brown, 2590  Loop Road West, Building 558, Room 104, Wright Patterson AFB, OH  45433-7142, fax to 937-656-5020, or email to latoya.brown@wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC>This effort is for engineering and inspection services for the continuation of an eighteen (18) year Pressure and Hazardous Material System (PHMS) certification program, an on-going effort to produce AEDC maintainable drawing schematics that accurately reflect the field installation of selected AEDC systems, completing the ultra-sonic inspection of 13 above ground oil-water separator storage tanks and the conduct of related engineering studies for the United States Air Force, Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC), Arnold AFB TN.  This effort also includes a start-up effort to certify the PHMS at AEDC facilities located at White Oak MD.  Certification is a multi-step process that includes field verification, engineering analysis, non-destructive examination, deficiency correction monitoring, as-built documentation review and in-service inspection planning.  Systems or subsystems are to be certified for continued safe operations under customer performance criteria with minimal impact to the AEDC test mission.  AEDC test systems range in age from new to over fifty (50) years old.  The White Oak systems are over thirty (30) years old.   

 To date, approximately 161 of the 252 certification projects at Arnold AFB have been completed.  Approximately 54 of the 252 certification projects are in various phases of completion.  The AEDC White Oak MD facility has identified eight (8) new projects for PHMS certification.

AEDC anticipates negotiating a one year cost-plus-award-fee contract with eight one-year options.  To be considered for award, the offeror must clearly demonstrate that it will provide a staff with appropriate management and technical skills to accomplish assigned certifications in the area of PHMS.  Significant evaluation factors will be (1) mission capability with emphasis on technical approach in compliance with the Request for Proposal (RFP) and Statement of Work, (2) relevant past and present performance and (3) cost.   

A  RFP will be posted on or about 9 April 07 with proposals due 30-days after the RFP is posted.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) intends to negotiate a one-year base period contract with four (4) additional one-year option periods to acquire the services of a third-party contractor to provide technical oversight of laboratory services (provided under separate contract to FRA) for toxicological analysis of samples obtained from various railroad employees subject to FRA’s mandatory Post-Accident Toxicological Testing Program, as implemented pursuant to Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 219 -- Control of Alcohol and Drug Use; and to provide specialized, expert advice and assistance to FRA in accomplishing its objectives and mandates under 49 CFR Part 219 and 49 CFR Part 40 --Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs. Since 1986, the FRA has required the special testing of rail crews to determine if drugs or alcohol were either a primary or contributing cause to a significant rail accident or incident. Following regulation-triggering events, samples are collected by carrier-selected medical facilities using FRA mandatory post-accident split-sample toxicology kits. Specimens include urine and whole blood for surviving crew members, and urine, whole blood, and tissue for deceased crew members. Samples are analyzed by utilizing FRA-established cutoffs in urine and whole blood, and results obtained must be scientifically sound and legally defensible. The third-party technical oversight contractor (contractor) must be capable of assessing and attesting to the reliability of the Department of Health and Human Services/Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (DHHS/SAMHSA) certified laboratory’s capabilities for (1) Receiving and preserving specimen sets. (2) Accessioning specimens and implementing strict chain-of-custody procedures. (3) Analyzing specimen sets based on FRA-approved screening and confirmatory protocols using approved immunoassays ranging from KIMS, EIA, RIA, or FPIA to GC/MS. Additionally, the contractor must provide FRA with ongoing assessments on the qualifications and expertise of the laboratory and assigned personnel relative to the interpretation of test findings and their capabilities to (a) provide expert testimony regarding the laboratory’s analysis of urine, whole blood, and tissue; (b) advise FRA regarding the significance of analytical data in the determination of accident/incident cause and the meaning of test findings with respect to human performance; (c) provide a statement of pharmacological significance related to positive determination, addressing drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, possible usage scenarios, and possible physiological effects; and (d) properly interpret post-mortem findings in light of possible microbial generation of alcohol. The contractor will be utilized by the FRA to help ensure, through scheduled quarterly inspections using DHHS certified/licensed inspectors and forensic toxicology experts, that the contracted laboratory’s procedures and analysis of FRA samples are scientifically sound and legally defensible, that the laboratory maintains high levels of quality and reliability in its product and service offerings to FRA, and that the laboratory’s operations otherwise fully satisfy FRA’s Post-Accident Toxicological Testing Program scientific, technical, and administrative goals. The contractor subjects the laboratory to both open and blind proficiency testing in whole blood and urine. Samples are constructed by the contractor to challenge the laboratory’s ability to analyze specimens in accordance with approved FRA protocols at established cutoffs. Following inspections, the contractor drafts (for FRA-approval) reports of findings, recommendations, and/or required changes to operating procedures for implementation by the contracted laboratory. The contractor is responsible for providing expert advice on Department of Transportation (DOT), Drug Enforcement and Program Compliance guidance documents, and developing or assisting in the preparation of materials and conducting technical training for FRA, Office of Safety, Operating Practices (OP) inspectors (Federal and state). The contractor must be prepared to individually instruct or co-instruct classes in urine specimen collection, laboratory analysis, MRO functions, Substance Abuse Professional (SAP) functions, breath specimen collection, mandatory post-accident specimen collection for both surviving and deceased crew members, and other topics as assigned. The contractor is responsible for providing FRA with one or more technical experts for Part 219 compliance audits of both rail carriers and their service providers at various designated locations throughout the country. Contractor technical experts must be prepared to act as senior adjunct members of a team of FRA inspectors auditing all drug and alcohol requirements of the applicable federal rules (both Part 219 and Part 40). Special expertise is required in urine, blood, and breath specimen collection; collection chain-of-custody and documentation; laboratory procedures, analysis, and test result documentation; MRO procedures and documentation; SAP procedures and documentation; and other elements and requirements of said rules. The contractor is responsible for development or updating of the Part 219 Compliance Manual for FRA OP Inspectors and the railroad industry, which provides detailed protocol on how to properly evaluate all Part 219 and Part 40 elements, and how to comply with all Part 219 requirements, including service provider and carrier responsibilities and record keeping. The contractor is also responsible for developing and presenting seminars specifically designed to show regulated carriers how to properly comply with Part 219 drug and alcohol regulations, and seminars/training modules for OP inspectors to certify them as Part 219 compliance field experts. Additionally, the scope of the Post-Accident laboratory contract is subject to change due to scientific and technical innovations; consequently, this scope requirement may be subject to change.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

NO RECONDITIONED ITEMS ARE ACCEPTABLE.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the CA/CST.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Remedy licenses.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST/DO is renewing their support contract for the Remedy Help Desk Application Software as well as the licenses that they currently have from a previous procurement of Remedy.  They will be utilizing this support during ad after the DO/PPT Help Desk integration; it is imperative that this product support be renewed.  The following is a description of the services required which will be renewed with the award of this requisition: CA/CST/DO needs programming capability to implement the new Remedy system.  These software development licenses will be used to create a developmental/test environment for the ARS-DO implementation of the Remedy ITSM products suite.  As well as creating a separate development/test environment for ARS-DO Remedy, these licenses will also allow the DO-Training team to train users using a mirror image of the current product database without impacting the production dataset. The value enhancement of a development environment is the ability to leverage additional features and functionality of the BMC Remedy product line.  Additionally, the environment can be torn down and rebuilt with an exact replica of production environment resources at any time without affecting the productions environment.<BR><BR>As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. This requisition is to renew the existing support contract and licenses which is justified by the following qualifications, unique to this requirement:   The BMC Remedy ITSM suite has been in use in DO since August 2005.  Internal and external groups utilize this system to inform and resolve problem areas and to manage the process of issue resolution.  Prior to last August, the programs used by DO to track trouble tickets and assets had traditionally been customized, internally developed applications.  Based on many analyses, DO moved from the custom application to an “out-of-the-box” solution that leverages industry standards and realigned business processes with industry best practices.  It has been recommended, based on a cost-benefit analysis, to configure a development environment for: ·	Conducting development efforts ·	Testing developed products ·	Compatibility testing ·	Use case scenario testing ·	Infrastructure change testing and evaluation ·	Training ·	Demonstrations The project team has received a dedicated server intended for use as a development and testing server.  It has been configured and is currently using temporary demo licenses obtained from BMC.  These temporary licenses allow DO to utilize the server for development and testing on the implemented ITSM modules until the purchase of development licenses is completed.  Development and training on the remaining modules cannot be performed in the system’s current state.  Using the dedicated server, the project team will apply the development licenses, which will provide the ability to perform development and testing activities for all ITSM modules in an isolated environment.  The development environment will mirror the production environment in every aspect possible.  Changes made in the development environment can be: ·	Duplicated in the production environment which will be the case with successfully tested and approved changes ·	Rolled back in the case of failed changes, unapproved changes, and after each training session to reset the databases, allowing the next training session to be conducted 	Separating the development from the production environment is an industry best practice.  The greatest benefit of the development environment will be that all changes that might cause a service disruption are isolated. Additionally, if developmental efforts have to be performed in the production environment, DO’s Remedy ITSM suite would be significantly impeded.<BR><BR>support contract # 32102.<BR><BR>CHANGED LINE ITEM 004<BR><BR>

<CONTACT>Anita Tolliver Contract Specialist 7037871092     Anita.Tolliver@mms.gov;
<DESC>THE FOLLOWING ANNOUNCEMENT IS CANCELLED: The Government intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed-price (FFP) acquisition with Agfa Corporation.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the Department of the Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of McGuire Air Force Base.  This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Soliciting from a single source.  Description:  The Government has a requirement for three (3) Barco Coronis 5 Mega Pixel (5MP) LCD gray scale monitors as an upgrade to the current Barco Coronis CRT monitors being used for radiological screening and testing.  The sole source determination is based on the fact that the monitors must be purchased from Agfa Corporation to ensure system compatibility since the monitors are an upgrade to the current Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) system.  The monitors connect to a graphics card that is designed to work only with monitors provided by Agfa, so an upgrade to the system monitors must be purchased from Agfa to ensure system compatibility. Additionally, the warranty and service maintenance agreements already in place will only continue if the monitors are purchased from and installed by Agfa.    No solicitation package will be issued.  This is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received by February 26, 2007, no later than 10:00am, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  POC: Anita Tolliver and Deborah Anderson, GovWorks, 381 Elden Street, Suite 4000, Herndon, Virginia, 20170.  Questions must be e-mailed to Anita.Tolliver@mms.gov and Deborah.Anderson@mms.gov.

<DESC>The CFT source selection team briefed OUSD/DPAP on 3-16-07 at the Pentagon.  The purpose of this briefing was to close the loop on several outstanding issues/questions from the 8 Jan 07 briefing to the same office.  The results of this latest briefing were positive.  A few minor taskings were issued, but overall approval of the acquisition strategy as presented was obtained.  OUSD/DPAP has agreed to recommend approval of the acquisition strategy to OSD/AT&L.  This will likely occur sometime in April 2007.  In the meantime, the team will begin preparation of the internal documents required to obtain written approval to issue the formal RFP from OSD/AT&L.  Notable outcomes from the briefing are: (1) The contract length was agreed to be up to 7 years and (2) it has been decided to increase the potential award pool to "UP TO" 6 contracts under the full and open portion.  No revisions were made to the SB approach.  No further changes to the strategy are expected.  There have been some changes overall to the process since the draft RFP was issued in Nov 2006, and all parties are highly encouraged to carefully review the formal RFP upon its issuance to verify these changes.  It is anticipated the formal RFP will be issued no later than 4 May 2007.  However, this date is dependant upon completion /approval of the formal RFP itself and all documentation required to issue the RFP.  The date is subject to change and notice will be posted as soon as any changes are known to WWW.FBO.GOV if this should happen.

We thank you for your continued interest.

<DESC>LAIRCM NEXT GENERATION (NEXGEN) MISSILE WARNING SUBSYSTEM (MWS) PRODUCTTION PROGRAM UPDATE

The Government hereby issues an Amendment to the final Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Next Generation (NexGen) Missile Warning Subsystem (MWS) Production effort.  This Amendment is issued to clarify Section L & M requirements. 

The current RFP, in the area of Total Evaluate Cost/Price (TECP) had a discrepancy concerning O&S (now Spares & Repairs) with showing it as an other cost consideration and as proposed.  The Government intends to establish a Government Estimate of Spares & Repairs and it will be reflected in the TECP.  Also, it stated that the TECP would consist of all basic award and all options but it stated too that we would present the Depot Repair/Reprocurement data options as other cost considerations.  The Government intends for both of these options to be reflected in the TECP as well.  The Schedule Risk Assessment (SRA) has been moved in its entirety from the Proposal Risk area to the Systems Engineering/Program Management (SE/PM) sub-factor of Mission Capability.  Since the Integrated Master Schedule is a function of SE/PM, the assessment will be done within the SE/PM area.

The Government has highlighted areas to facilitate review; however, other minor clarifications exist throughout Sections L & M that are not highlighted.  The following areas have been amended:

1)	In accordance with Section L, paragraph 6.1.7, estimates of labor categories and hours for Studies and Analysis purposes have been provided in Section L, Attachment L-14.
2)	The RSP requirement kit quantities in Section L, paragraph 6.1.6, page 28 have been updated to reflect the correct amounts as displayed in Section L, Attachment L-11.
3)	The fiscal years displayed for T&M estimates for ICS, Section L, Attachment L-14, have been updated to reflect the correct fiscal years - FY08, 09, and 10.
4)	All references to Operation & Support (O&S) are changed to Spares and Repairs Support.
a.	Clarification to Section L, Paragraph 6.3.4.2; concerning O&S.
b.	Clarification to Section L, Attach L-12, O&S Spreadsheet
c.	Clarification to Section M, Section 6.0, with regards to the evaluation of the O&S data provided by the offeror(s) and Reprocurement Data/Depot Repair Options.
d.	A new Spares & Repairs spreadsheet replaces the O&S spreadsheet  
5)	Clarify Section M, Para 6.3 concerning Total Evaluated Cost/Price
6)	All Cost Realism references were removed from Section M.
7)	References to Schedule Risk Assessment have been clarified throughout Sections L & M.
8)	Model Contract
a.	Revised ASC/GRK-H004 clause and added ASC/GRK-H006 clause to address Reprocurement Data.
b.	Updated Descriptive Data on CLINS 0031 & 0032

Offeror(s) shall submit updated proposals on 27 Mar 07 (Tuesday) no later than 3:00PM (Eastern Daylight Savings Time).

All communications regarding this source selection must be through the contracting officer, Capt Casey Kopecky at (937) 255-1943/0230 or e-mail, Casey.Kopecky@wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC>Note:  This announcement was originally posted 15 Mar 07.  With the posting of this modification, it is hoped that extraneous punctuation marks (appearing in the original post) will not appear. There is no change to the substance of the announcement.

The Naval Air Warfare Center - Training Systems Division (NAWC-TSD) has a requirement to provide curriculum and courseware support for the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA).

The CNATRA mission is to train Pilots, Undergraduate Military Flight Officers (UMFOs) and Enlisted Air Crewmen for the Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), as well as several foreign countries, through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program.  The overall goal / objective is to produce military qualified aviators that meet the skill requirements of a diverse client base optimized to a production and completion schedule that integrates with customer demand.

  The Assistant Chief of Staff (ACOS) for Aviation Training and Standardization, CNATRA N7, is tasked with the study, analysis, design, definition, development, documentation, implementation, training management, Revision and Maintenance (R&M), and standardization of all aviation training curricula, courseware, and training materials. This N7 tasking includes management and organizational support, front end analysis, labor, equipment, training facilities, tools, training devices, supervision and other services necessary to support all Naval Air Training Command (NATRACOM) classroom, simulator, and flight training programs; including extensive on-site support at the locations identified below.

Located at NAS Corpus Christi, Texas, the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) oversees the Naval Air Training Command (NATRACOM), which includes five Training Air Wings located on five Naval Air Stations in Florida, Mississippi, and Texas.  The five wings are home to 17 Training Squadrons.  In addition, Joint Services Training (JST) is also conducted with the Air Force on bases in Oklahoma and Texas.  There are six NATRACOM locations that support the primary mission of the CNATRA, including the N7 centrally managed Flight Training Support Center (FTSC).  

NATRACOM squadrons log approximately 400,000 flight hours each year in seven types of training aircraft/platforms with a total compliment of over 750 airplanes.  More than 1,800 pilots and Naval Flight Officers (NFOs) earn their  "Wings of Gold" from the NATRACOM annually.  These six NATRACOM locations include:

CNATRA N7  Flight Training Support Center (FTSC) - NAS Corpus Christi, TX
Training Air Wing One - NAS Meridian, MS
Training Air Wing Two - NAS Kingsville, TX
Training Air Wing Four - NAS Corpus Christi, TX
Training Air Wing Five - NAS Whiting Field, FL
Training Air Wing Six - NAS Pensacola, FL

This effort is to provide direct support for all NATRACOM curricula, courseware, and training materials, centrally managed and maintained by the Flight Training Support Center (FTSC), satisfying the Command's aviation training requirements within a well timed, efficient, and accurate corporate continuum.  The FTSC is composed of the Operational Support Segment (OSS), which includes Training Integration Management System (TIMS) product development, the Curriculum and Courseware Support Segment (CSS), and the Configuration Management and Quality Control - Support Segment (CM/QC-SS); all Support Segments are dedicated to direct operational/functional training support.  The FTSC Support Segments are critical elements of the NATRACOM training environment and crucial to primary mission objectives.  Present course material is undergoing conversion to Authorware 7.0 with full Shareable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) compliance.  The Contractor shall deliver to the Government all products, software, author-ware, hardware, documentation, data rights, and operating licenses procured / developed for, or incidental to, this Contract effort.  This total effort involves "roughly" 40 aviation curricula, 825+ Computer Based Training (CBT) lessons, and approximately 135 aviation training technical documents/publications.

Contractor activities will include the design, development, Revision and Maintenance (R&M), conversion, testing, documentation, training, delivery of completed product to the government, and establishing and tracking the inter-dependent relationships and operational support of all CNATRA Headquarters and NATRACOM aviation training curricula, courseware, and training materials/publications.  This requirement also includes: Instructional System Design (ISD); courseware authoring; technical publication support; program/project management; configuration management and quality control; and data management. 

In addition, the contractor shall provide process-engineering support that is focused on a continuous process improvement that increases the quality of the product and services provided to the CNATRA and NATRACOM customer base.  The selected contractor must be able to comply with Capability Maturity Model Integrated (CMMI)-Level 3.

A critical element of the CNATRA corporate business process, which includes the contract work-force, is effective utilization and implementation of Operational Risk Management (ORM).

Structurally, the NATRACOM and CNATRA staff utilize microcomputer based client server network, hardware, and software to support current and future requirements. All technology services provided must comply with Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) standards established by Naval Network Warfare Command (NETWARCOM). 

	It is anticipated that the contracted effort will take the form of a combination SOO/SOW, with written proposals supported by an oral component.  

           Anticipated contractual milestones are as follows:

      RFP Release -16Apr07
      Possible site visits - 7-11May07 
      Proposals due - 14Jun07 
      Anticipated award - 1Sep07
      Anticipated contract start date - 1Oct07

The Government intends to conduct a competitive acquisition under the 8(a) Program per FAR Subpart 19.8.  The resultant contract is anticipated to be a 5-year contract with one (1) base year and four (4) option years with both Fixed Price and Cost contract type elements.  8(a) businesses capable of accomplishing the required effort, within the NAICS code 511210, are invited to submit a statement of interest to include possible teaming/subcontractor arrangements.  Information should be sent via e-mail to paul.host@navy.mil.

Responses are requested by close of business 30 Mar 07.  The submission of this information is for PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any services, nor for the Government to pay for the information received.  No solicitation document exists at this time.  Questions concerning this requirement should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Paul Host, via email at paul.host@navy.mil or by telephone at (407) 380-4272.

Tasks in support of this effort are subject to change as the dynamics of the Department of Defense, Department of Navy, and CNATRA mission requirements change.  As the Navy undergoes an evolution in automation, tasks within this effort are subject to modification, revision, removal, or addition.

<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency Region I Boston, Massachusetts is seeking sources for the following equipment:

Computerized Ambient Air Monitoring Calibration System  
Basic Description: The calibration system mixes clean zero reference air with a certified calibration gas to produce and display a known gaseous concentration which is then introduced into on-site instruments to be calibrated/audited. The system must have on board automated software that automatically calculates flow rates and concentrations, multi-event programming and unattended automatic operation and allows for selection of various flow ports for assignment. Types of ambient air monitoring pollutants include Ozone (03), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Sulfur Dioxide (S02), and Oxides of Nitrogen (NO- N02-NOx). This system must produce an air flow rate up to and including 30 Standard Liters per Minute (SLPM) and a gaseous flow rate of up to 100 Standard Cubic 
Centimeters per Minute (SCCM) by using two individual Mass Flow Controllers. The calibration system needs an internal Ozone generator to conduct both Ozone output concentrations for ozone calibrations and ozone 9utput for Gas Phase Titration (GPT) calibrations utilizing a reaction chamber blender. The system must use Teflon tubing throughout. Weight and size are important because the system needs to be portable and 
rack mounted while still maintaining the best quality system. The calibration system must be able to output a 30SLPM gaseous mix under pressure to a receiving instrument or sampling manifold. 
Mass Flow Controllers (MFC): 1 MFC with flow range of 0 -30 SLP~ 
1 MFC with flow range of 0 -100 SCCM 
MFC's must be traceable to NIST using a reference temperature of 25 degrees C 
and a reference pressure of 760mmHg. Flow accuracy from 10% to 100% of scale 
of +/- 1 % with a 1% repeatability. Warm up time of not more than 30 minutes with not more than 30 second response times to 2% of flow set point. Stainless steel 
surfaces with Viton seals. MFC calibrations automatically stored within system software. 
Uv Ozone Generator: Range 0.5 to 1.25ppm @ 10SLPM 0.500ppm @ 30SLPM. 
Accuracy of+/- 2% or +/- 0.005ppm @10SPLM 30 day repeatability of +/-2% or +/- 0.005ppm Pressure and temperature controlled. 
Input/Output Requirements: 
All fittings are 1f4 inch stainless steel Swagelok. Four 1f4 inch span gas input ports. One 1f4 inch output fitting. Reference air in fittings. 
Minimum 10 psig input pressure with a max of 150 psig 
Maximum weight 40 pounds 
Maximum Rack mounted dimensions 19" X 7" X 25" Operating temperature 32 deg F to 122 deg F. Rack mounts 
Standard 115 V AC 60 Hz @ 3 amps electrical needs. 
Large backlit liquid crystal display for better visibility&safety with status board 
interface. 
RS 232 data port. 

EPA is considering a Brand Name Purchase of an Environics Series 9100 Computerized Ambient Monitoring Calibration System to fulfill this requirement.If you produce or distribute a different piece of equipment which meets the above technical requirements please contact the listed point of contact.

<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency Region I, Boston Massachusetts, is seeking sources for the following equipment:

Zero Air System Requirements: 
Basic Description: The Zero Air system filters/scrubs impurities from the air and 
supplies instrumentation with clean dry air, under pressure at a desired flow rate. Inlet air is pulled into the pump and routed through a pre-cooler and water trap which removes the water. The air then passes through a regenerative scrubber, where final drying occurs and then to an internal storage tank The system needs to have an internal oil-less diaphragm- less pump and provide an air flow of 30 Liters Per Minute (LPM). The scrubbers need to remove water (H2O), Sulfur Dioxide (S02), Ozone (03), Carbon Monoxide (CO), 
Oxides of Nitrogen (NO-N02), H2S and Hydrocarbons. Where size and weight are important, the system must have an internal pump, internal storage tank and rack 
mounting. The dimensions are not to exceed 8.57" X 17" X 23.5" and a maximum weight of 55 Ibs. 
Specifications: 
Flow: 30 LPM @ 3Opsig

<DESC>THIS PROJECT IS ADVERTISED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS PURSUANT TO THE SMALL BUSINESS COMPETITIVE DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM.     THE NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE FOR THIS PROJECT IS 238220.  The Department of Veteran's Affairs (DVA) is contemplating the award of up to six  Multiple Award Contract (MAC) to Electrical Contractors having experience with design/build and performance-based contracts, and with past experience with Department of Defense (DoD) or other Government healthcare facilities, to perform as prime contractors on various Electrical Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization (SRM) projects within the Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) locations.  Approximately 10 to 15% of projects may require performance in non-hostile OCONUS and/or foreign locations.  These projects are being procured by the DVA for the Air Force, or other potential DoD agencies, under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 8111.  In general, the MAC contracted efforts will consist of furnishing all labor, supervision, tools, materials, and equipment necessary to perform SRM services for DoD Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF) nationwide, possibly including Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico, and other US Territories, as well as OCONUS locations such as Japan, South Korea, Italy, and Great Britain.   Anticipated requirements include one-time repair, renovation, and maintenance of electrical equipment within medical facilities to include preventive, predictive, demand, and emergency maintenance.   In addition, task orders may include efforts classified as construction requirements incidental to SRM needs (such as installation/extension of utilities, minor reconfiguration of treatment areas to support new medical equipment, etc).   Medical facilities may be of any configuration or state of repair depending on age and location.  Example systems and equipment include but are not limited to transformers, control panels, generators, metering, electrical system components, circuits, and switchboards.  Contractors must be aware of the health and life safety issues that must be considered while performing these demanding tasks in an occupied medical treatment facility with an active inpatient population.   Specific requirements, such as the stringent infection control measures in place at all medical treatment facilities, will be identified in the individual task orders, but potential offerors are advised that special requirements (to include requirements ranging from security to immunization requirements for individual workers) are typically required because the work will be performed in occupied medical treatment and/or medical research facilities.  The Government contemplates awards of at least three Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts resulting from this solicitation which will include a base year and four one-year options.  The total maximum value to be shared amongst all contracts awarded under this solicitation is estimated at $150,000,000.00 over five years. There is no guarantee that this maximum value will be distributed equally.  Awardees will share this total value through a competitive task order award process.  SPECIAL NOTE:  One MAC contractor will be issued an initial task order based on competitively evaluated award of a seed project included in the MAC solicitation.  This seed project within this MAC solicitation is a modernization effort will take place at the 374th Medical Squadron Hospital located at Yokota Air Base Japan.  The 132,300 Sq Ft facility was constructed in 1974.  This effort will entail the following tasks:  1 - Replacement of the 2000 Ampere Building Service Entrance Switchgear; 2 - Revalidation & Re-programming of the Hospital's Emergency Electrical System Life Safety Load Management system,  3 - Replacement of the Antiquated Mechanical System Motor Control Center;  4 - Revise clinic transformer service configuration to provide disconnecting means and overcurrent protection to all existing service feeders;  5 - Replacement and Upgrade of the 6600 volt Medium Voltage Feeder Circuits #9 and #10 local to the Hospital;   6 - Upgrade the 6600 volt Medium Voltage Selector Switch Serving the Clinic; 7 - Upgrade the Secondary Power System for the ASF Facility.  The estimated value of this effort is between $1,400,000 and $2,000,000.    Performance and payment bonds will be required on this task order in an undetermined percentage, and also in a majority of other task orders issued under this MAC award.  Offerors must possess the bonding capabilities and sufficient resources required by the scope of this contract in order to be favorably considered.  This requirement is being procured through the Joint Venture Acquisition Center, Austin, TX.  Solicitation documents should be available for download on or around 30 March 2007.

<DESC>Joint Contracting Command Iraq/Afghanistan on behalf of the Gulf Regional Division (GRD) Reconstruction Logistics intends to solicit for continued operations of two strategically located Wholesale Distribution Center Warehousing and Staging Area facilities; one located within the vicinity of Baghdad North/Abu Guraib and one located within the vicinity of the Port of Umm Qasr, both having satellite locations; for the receipt, accounting, cross-docking, re-packaging, re-shipping, and re-distribution of material with minimal warehousing operations within reasonable cost.  Secondarily, this proposed contract shall provide the capability to facilitate the management and physical responsibility to maintain site operations, security, management, facilities/equipment maintenance, life support, and secure transportation requirements for the movement of materiel from the Wholesale Distribution Center Warehouse and Staging Area to receiving retails distribution centers or end users.  Additionally, subject services may be used to move materiel for projects supporting U.S. military forces, coalition and/or multinational forces, and other governmental/non-governmental agencies.  Each of the two warehouse facilities will require the necessary maintenance to ensure the facilities are operated in an efficient and effective manner that is conducive to perform tactical, operational, and strategic level logistics.  Site management and operations will require the need to facilitate interior security, which will be performed by an independent contractor, of associated facilities, any auxiliary sites, and all materiel under control of the contractor in order to ensure that equipment, supplies, and materiel can be held in a fully accountable, short-term, transient status pending redistribution to its final destination.  As part of the overall concept of operations, the Contractor will be responsible for providing or coordinating secure transportation services which include but will not be limited to moving equipment, supplies, and materiel using all types of consignments ranging from local less-than-truck-load moves to long hauls involving multiple truck loads.

The Department owns perpetual software licenses for the products -- however software support is a separate expense and represents an ongoing annual expenditure. PeopleSoft products are the basis for much of ILMS.  The PeopleSoft products currently used by ILMS include: PeopleSoft Inventory, PO, CRM Support server license, Object Studio,  Balanced Scorecard,  Enterprise Warehouse,  Supply Chain Management,  Activity Based Management,  GL, and AM modules A full description of the software maintenance services that are required can be found on the GSA Federal Supply Schedule for Mythics.<BR><BR>Due to the proprietary nature of the PeopleSoft software, the required software support is available only from Mythics, the firm that is certified to resell software support by Oracle/Peoplesoft.  Software support is crucial for continued utilization of the software in ILMS.   ILMS is the State Department's comprehensive supply chain management system. ILMS is composed of an assortment of customized off-the-shelf software products as well as certain purpose-built software modules that have been linked and integrated with one another, and with the State Department's Financial Management System.  In the course of design and development of ILMS for the State Department, the systems integrator selected and incorporated into ILMS the products and support services provided by PeopleSoft USA, Inc.  ILMS will not function without these components. Although it would theoretically be possible to purchase and customize software that could replace the PeopleSoft software currently used by ILMS, integrate the new software with the rest of the ILMS software modules, and retrain the existing user base -- such an effort would be time consuming, prohibitively costly and would not shield the Department from an identical need for ongoing expenditures for maintenance and support.  Moreover, a decision not to proceed to procure support from would have a significant adverse impact, placing at risk the majority of the software that makes up ILMS.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Technology Transfer of Best Practices for Concrete and Concrete Pavements 

Potential Sources Sought. This is not a RFP.   
The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources for an anticipated award to advance the knowledge and use of best practices for concrete and concrete pavements.  The effort requires: development of training materials; delivery of seminars and related training activities; and, sponsorship of conferences for the highway community, including all of FHWA’s customers and partners concerned with the design, construction, repair, and rehabilitation of concrete pavements.

The advancement of best practices for concrete and concrete pavements consists of three distinct yet related parts: 

Part A:  Development of training materials; 

Part B:  Delivery of seminars and related training activities; and

Part C:  Sponsorship of conferences for the highway community. 

Part A:  Development of Training Materials  

The training materials needed for seminars, workshops and conferences will be prepared and distributed in both printed and electronic documents as needed such as, but not limited to, informational flyers, technical briefs, videos and technical reports. The major tasks are:

Task 1:  Develop a training syllabus and related materials needed by State DOTs to prepare their inspectors for the ACI Transportation Inspector Certification test.  

Task 2:  Update and refresh course materials currently used for FHWA sponsored seminars.

Task 3:  Publish training materials in both printed and electronic formats. 

Task 4:  Distribute sample copies of the materials and information on the Inspector Certification Program to each State DOT and to FHWA’s field offices including Division Offices, Federal Lands Offices, and Resource Center. 

Part B:  Deliver Seminars and Related Training Activities  

The seminars and related training activities are for delivery as needed throughout the USA. The major tasks are:

Task 5:  Distribute marketing brochures to advertise the seminars and related training activities to State DOTs, FHWA’s field offices, and members of the concrete industry.

Task 6:  Provide two instructors and handout material for approximately twelve (12) seminars and related training activities per year incorporating information concerning the following subject areas.
•Cementitious materials and concrete mixtures
•Admixtures, including self-consolidating admixtures

Task 7:  Provide an evaluation report to FHWA and to the sponsoring State DOT for each seminar and related training activity conducted. 

Task 8:  Conduct training sessions as needed for State DOT inspectors in preparation for administering the ACI Transportation Inspector Certification test.  

Task 9:  Prepare a report on the activities under this cooperative agreement on an annual basis, and submit it to the Government.

Part C:  Sponsor National and International Conferences  

Currently, there are significant national and international conferences on concrete-related topics that are of interest to the highway community.  This task would provide a means for FHWA to participate in and fund selected conferences as a co-sponsor.

Task 10:  Develop and routinely update a listing of national and international conferences on concrete-related topics that are of interest to the highway community and submit this listing to FHWA for review and prioritization. 

Task 11:  Coordinate the process for FHWA participation in and funding of up to three (3) such conferences per year.   


The awardee selected will be expected to have capabilities in:

•Technical and engineering – Capabilities to fully understand the technical aspects of materials and admixtures for use in concrete, concrete mixtures and properties of fresh and hardened concrete; and, the ability to convey that knowledge to other parties including but not limited to engineers, contractors and agency/owners of roadways. Technical and engineering staff members should be conversant in current and relevant topics concerning best practices for concrete materials and concrete production, and best practices for concrete pavement design, construction, repair, and rehabilitation.  

•Communications and marketing – Capabilities to develop, maintain and utilize a variety contact lists and mailing lists.  Other capabilities that would be considered useful include editorial and document production services.


•Project management and reporting – Capabilities to perform and/or direct the efforts of technical, engineering, communications, and marketing staff. Timely and cost-effective performance in each of these areas is required. 

The estimated period of performance for the project is five years.  FHWA anticipates a level of effort ranging from 2 to 4 professional and technical staff members per year for the duration of the project.  

Note: the level of activity will greatly depend on continued and additional funding under the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) to FHWA. 

RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE: Any interested organizations are invited to submit a Capability Statement by April 02, 2007, by e-mail to Katasha.White@DOT.gov, or in writing to Federal Highway Administration, Office of Acquisition Management, Attn: Ms. Katasha G. White, HAAM 40F, Room 4410, 400 7th Street, SW, Washington DC, 20590.

The Government is in need of information on potential sources for a  contractor support contract for the B-2 Training System. Responses to this  RFI will support the development of an acquisition strategy for a contract  to supplant the current B-2 TSCLS contract (F33657-98-D-0005). B-2 Training System (TS) Components The B-2 TS provides aircrew, maintenance, and weapons loading training at  Whiteman Air Force Base, MO.  It includes training devices, software,  courseware, academic materials, and support elements (hardware, software,  support equipment, spares, and documentation) necessary to train B-2  aircrews, maintenance personnel, and weapons load crews, and to keep the  system current with the fielded aircraft.  The B-2 Training System  consists of the following: the Aircrew Training System (ATS) consisting of  Weapons System Trainers (WSTs) and Mission Trainers (MTs); the Maintenance  Training System (MTS) consisting of Cockpit Procedures Trainers (CPTs),  which are used for both aircrew and maintenance training, Computerized  Maintenance Training System (CMTS) suites each with six Weapon System  Training Aids (WSTAs), a Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer, a Flight  Control Systems Trainer (FSCT), and a Weapons Loading Trainer.  The B-2  Training System also includes a Training System Support Center (TSSC)  which provides on-site sustaining engineering support activities for the  training system.  There is also a Training System Center (TSC), located at  the contractor’s facility, to handle any software updates to the  maintenance training system. There are 58 devices as follows: Device	                    Number    Location	        Location Weapon System Trainer	    3	      Whiteman AFBMission  Trainer	            2	      Whiteman AFB (1)  Contractor’s Facility (1) Cockpit Procedures Trainer  8	      Whiteman AFB (4)	Contractor’s Facility  (4) Computerized Maintenance Training System                            6	      Whiteman AFB (5)	Contractor’s Facility (1) Weapon System Training Aid 36	      Whiteman AFB (30)	Contractor’s  Facility (6) Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Flight Control System Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Weapons Loader Trainer	    1	      Whiteman AFBTotal  Devices	           58Services Anticipated The anticipated need for the B-2 TS will include: field services for  training systems, academic instruction, training system contractor  logistics support, and concurrency management and software and systems  engineering.  The effort will include work associated with Distributed  Mission Operations (DMO), the Radar Modernization Program (RMP), and the  Extremely High Frequency (EHF) SatCom Program, as well as future efforts  needed to maintain training system concurrency with the jet. DMO For DMO, the B-2 Weapon System Trainers and Mission Trainers will connect  into the DMO Network (DMON) via a portal provided by Northrop Grumman  Mission Systems (NGMS), the DMO Operations and Integration contractor, and  will have to meet the Combat Air Forces (CAF) DMO Interoperability  Standards.  The contractor will be responsible for ensuring that the WST  design achieves and maintains compliance with DMO System Standards as they  evolve. RMP The B-2 RMP modifies the radar system to operate in a different, approved  radar frequency band.  The B-2 RMP does not provide new capability;  however, it is forcing changes to the aircrew and maintenance training  systems. EHF Satellite Communications (SATCOM) The B-2 EHF SATCOM and Computer Upgrade Program provides a secure, command  and control EHF communications system that ensures the interconnectivity  with a survivable communications link in either a nuclear or conventional  combat-stressed environment at all times throughout the mission. The  Training System will have to evolve in step with the changes being made to  the jet. Security Contractors will be required to have a secure facility.  Personnel working  on the B-2 Training System are required to have security clearances. Contract Items Effort for the B-2 Training System is desired to begin 1 January 2009  (immediately after the current contract expires on 31 December 2008). The Government anticipates a 10-year service delivery period. The B-2 Training System will remain at Whiteman Air Force Base, MO, where  it will be operated and maintained under Contractor Support.  The customer  at Whiteman is Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Education and Training  Command (AETC). CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY B-2 Training System Part I.

<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agencey Region I Boston, Massachusetts is seeking sources for the following equipment:

Computerized Ambient Air Monitorin2 Calibration System Requirements: 
Basic Description: The calibration system mixes clean zero reference air with a certified calibration gas to produce and display a known gaseous concentration which is then introduced into on-site instruments to be calibrated/audited. The system must have on board automated software that automatically calculates flow rates and concentrations, multi-event programming and unattended automatic operation and allows for selection of various flow ports for assignment. Types of ambient air monitoring pollutants include Ozone (03), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Sulfur Dioxide (S02), and Oxides of Nitrogen (NO- N02-NOx). This system must produce an air flow rate up to and including 30 Standard Liters per Minute (SLPM) and a gaseous flow rate of up to 100 Standard Cubic 
Centimeters per Minute (SCCM) by using two individual Mass Flow Controllers. The calibration system needs an internal Ozone generator to conduct both Ozone output concentrations for ozone calibrations and ozone 9utput for Gas Phase Titration (GPT) calibrations utilizing a reaction chamber blender. The system must use Teflon tubing throughout. Weight and size are important where the system needs to be portable and 
rack mounted while still maintaining the best quality system. The calibration system must be able to output a 30SLPM gaseous mix under pressure to a receiving instrument or sampling manifold. 
Mass Flow Controllers (MFC): 1 MFC with flow range of 0 -30 SLP~ 
1 MFC with flow range of 0 -100 SCCM 
MFC's must be traceable to NIST using a reference temperature of 25 degrees C 
and a reference pressure of 760mmHg. Flow accuracy from 10% to 100% of scale 
of +/- 1 % with a 1% repeatability. Warm up time of not more than 30 minutes with not more than 30 second response times to 2% of flow set point. Stainless steel 
surfaces with Viton seals. MFC calibrations automatically stored within system software.

<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency Region I, Boston Massachusetts, is seeking sources for the following equipment:

Zero Air System Requirements: 
Basic Description: The Zero Air system filters/scrubs impurities from the air and 
supplies instrumentation with clean dry air, under pressure at a desired flow rate. Inlet air is pulled into the pump and routed through a pre-cooler and water trap which removes the water. The air then passes through a regenerative scrubber, where final drying occurs and then to an internal storage tank The system needs to have an internal oil-less diaphragm- less pump and provide an air flow of 30 Liters Per Minute (LPM). The scrubbers need to remove water (H2O), Sulfur Dioxide (S02), Ozone (03), Carbon Monoxide (CO), 
Oxides of Nitrogen (NO-N02), H2S and Hydrocarbons. Where size and weight are important, the system must have an internal pump, internal storage tank and rack 
mounting. The dimensions are not to exceed 8.57" X 17" X 23.5" and a maximum weight of 55 Ibs. 
Specifications: 
Flow: 30 LPM @ 3Opsig

<SUBJECT>R -- CONSULTING SERVICES FOR CMS HCPCS WORKGROUP
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-HCPCS31907SEC
<RESPDATE>040207
<ARCHDATE>04172007
<CONTACT>Susan Crizer, Contracting Officer, Phone 410-786-5167, Fax 410-786-9643, Email SCrizer@cms.hhs.gov - Phillip Harrell, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-786-8635 , Fax 410-786-9643, Email phillip.harrell@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC>In October of 2003, the Secretary of HHS delegated authority under the HIPAA (45 CFR Parts 160 and 162, effective October 16,2000) legislation to CMS to maintain and distribute HCPCS Level II codes.  In an attempt to provide a fair and equitable system for the modification process of the HCPCS Level II code set for use by all payers, it is crucial that we capture a balance of input from both public ( i.e., Medicare & Medicaid)
and private insurers.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is seeking sources for the following requirement: The Level II Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) is a standardized coding system that is used primarily to identify products, supplies, and services not included in the HCPCS Level I (CPT) codes.  For example, ambulance services ad durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS) are identified by the Level II codes when used in a patient’s home, or in an outpatient setting.  Because Medicare and other insurers cover a variety of services, supplies, and equipment that are not identified by CPT codes, Level II codes were established for submitting claims for these items.

There is a need to contract for consulting from the private sector in order to ensure that the operating needs of all payers are considered.  In order to retain efficient coordination among national third party payers, we are soliciting proposals from such organizations.  We have already identified a candidate through a prior Request for Quote.  Also, the CMS HCPCS Workgroup currently has consultants in place to represent private payers.  However, we are advertising to solicit proposals from other entities that may have qualifications that are equal to organizations that have previously demonstrated their capability, such as the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association and America’s Health Insurance Plans.

It is critical that all proposals for consultants to the CMS HCPCS Workgroup meet all of the following criteria at the time the proposal is received:

A representative employee(s) or designee of a national third party payer; or a representative employee(s) or designee of a national association representing a large majority of national third party payers;

Knowledge of all aspects and impacts, to represented insurers, of modifications to the national HCPCS Level II Code System; 

Insight into the needs of internal and external customers and users of codes;

Extensive medical coding expertise;

An organization with a system in place that would facilitate the processing of “S” (primarily used by private sector) codes.

We anticipate award of a government purchase order utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures (dollar threshold of $100,000). All interested parties who wish to receive a Request for Quotation solicitation package should contact via e-mail susan.crizer@cms.hhs.gov or fax to (410) 786-9088 ( mark to the attention of Susan Crizer).  Telephone calls are not acceptable.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT, A MARKET SURVEY FOR ELECTRONIC/WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY.  THERE IS NOT A SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED.  THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO PAY FOR INFORMATION SUBMITTED.

The Social Security Administration (SSA), Office of Systems (OS) and Office of Disability Adjudication and Review (ODAR) are seeking to identify qualified sources interested in providing and implementing a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Image Knowledge Base software product or a service that provides and/or utilizes the functionality of an Image Knowledge Base software product.  The software or service may consist of multiple components, if necessary to meet the SSA’s requirements.  Qualified sources must have the capabilities of installing, configuring, and customizing the COTS software product or service to fulfill all SSA requirements for the Image Knowledge Base.

SSA’s ODAR, through its 145 hearing offices and remote sites is responsible for reviewing disability applications submitted by people all across the country requesting benefits from SSA.  ODAR reviews the relevant documents, conducts hearings, and awards benefits.  The use of the Electronic Folder (EF) by ODAR offices still requires manual organization of documents within the folder and data entry (keying) of information regarding those documents in order for the documents use in conformance with its business process.  Information has to be examined and organized in a manner that is useful to judges hearing the case.  In order to do so, ODAR employees in hearing offices classify documents into various categories and extract pertinent information from those documents.  The employee must look at a document’s identifying features, determine the type and title of the document and then enter the information into the electronic folder.  Afterwards, the employee organizes the documents chronologically and removes duplicates. 

The SSA invites all qualified sources to respond to this sources sought announcement.  ALL REQUIREMENTS ARE MANDATORY. 

REQUIREMENTS:

•	At a minimum, possess the capability to process a national workload from 145 hearing offices and remote sites nationwide that process approximately 550,000 cases per year that consist of, on an average, 300 document images per case.  Possess the capability to process these images within an acceptable period of time and with an acceptable level of accuracy.

•	Possess the capability to analyze scanned document images that are stored using Tagged Image File Format (tiff) and extract information and data from the images in order to build a knowledge base of information.  

•	Possess the capability to use the knowledge base of information to classify the document images into categories and subcategories according to the established SSA Electronic Folder (EF) rules for classification.

•	Possess the capability to separate document images from one another to avoid multiple document images from being inappropriately scanned, stored, and treated as a single document image.  The document images may be any combination of multiple known forms and/or multiple free format text documents.  This needs to include the ability to address those document images that already exist within SSA’s unstructured data repository where there is already some document separation and classification information.

•	Possess the capability to extract structured data from the document images such as Social Security Number (SSN), treatment dates, treatment source names, etc., and place the data in the appropriate fields specified by SSA for the Electronic Folder using SSA’s application program interfaces (APIs).

•	Possess the capability to automatically organize the document images (after classifying them), chronologically by treatment date or other parameters established by SSA for the EF. 

•	Possess the capability to support SSA’s viewing function (of the document images) by accessing the stored metadata in the EF, using SSA’s API’s, to organize the document images based on parameters established by SSA.

•	Possess the capability to identify and flag duplicate document images.

•	Possess the capability to identify and flag document images with poor quality.

•	Possess the capability to identify and flag images with low probability of being classified correctly with the ability to configure and dynamically adjust the probability ratio.

•	Possess the capability to monitor systems performance and provide statistical data.

•	Possess the capability to configure the service to dynamically enable/disable each specific function.

•	Possess the capability to integrate into SSA’s electronic disability (eDib) architecture as a service.

•	Possess the capability to demonstrate the document imaging tools and user interface in a test environment to show the capability and functionality.

•	Potentially possess the capability to identify and extract handwritten dates from the document images when necessary to establish treatment dates.

•	Potentially possess the capability to provide automatic redaction of structured data from document images for purposes such as Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests or other privacy reasons.

•	Support the Governments obligations under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (See http://www.ssa.gov/oag/acq/oagacq_508.htm).

•	Interoperate with both Internet Protocol (IPv6) from IPv4 systems and products, and if not initially, IPv6 compliant provide a mitigation path and provide a commitment to upgrade to IPv6 by June 2008.

•	The solution must adhere to SSA’s Enterprise Architectural standards.


Interested vendors must be able to provide verifiable proof by submitting information in sufficient detail to demonstrate clearly their ability to meet the Agency requirements, above.  A detailed response to each of the above requirements (including substantiating documentation) as well as the following information is required:

General Information about your firm Company Name, Address, Point of Contact, Telephone Number and E-mail address, GSA Schedule Number (if applicable), and  Tax ID Number;

Discussion of your firm’s ability to provide the Image Knowledge Base software product and/or service and additional components, if necessary, and any necessary customization;

Recommended products and implementation approach to providing the Image Knowledge Base solution that at a minimum includes: 

•	Development and testing of a  pilot integration plan for the functionality listed above for integration into the eDib architecture (See Note below);  

•	Testing performance of the plan in the Social Security Administration’s hearing office environment;

•	Evaluating and validating the results of the pilot (See Note below);

•	Providing statistical performance results as to loading, document and image processing times that can be validated by SSA;

•	Providing an estimate regarding the amount of hardware needed to support the project volumes (each disability case contains an average of 300 images);

•	Providing physical and functional block diagrams and/or high level data flows, architecture diagrams, etc., of the products offered that address interfaces/interface processes to other applications/databases;

•	Presenting the licensing structure for the software offering;

•	Providing detailed information on updating and maintaining the knowledge base.

•	Explaining related services, components, project management, technical support, training, updates, etc., that you would provide in addition to the products.

Note: The intent is to develop and implement a national system with the first phase consisting of a pilot within a select number of hearing offices.  Upon successful testing and implementation of the pilot, next would be a roll out of the system nationwide with the ability to make immediate refinements to the knowledge base.  

Please show experience demonstrating your firm’s ability to provide, install, configure, and customize a major/federal integrated Image Knowledge Base solution that, at a minimum, supports the volume of ODAR caseloads and images and supports customization and enhancement.  

SSA will not consider simple marketing information or incomplete responses.  SSA will not consider reference to vendor web sites a valid response.  Respondents should indicate whether their software is available on GSA Federal Supply Schedules, other Government-wide Agency Contract (GWAC), or Open Market.  Vendors may submit generalized pricing data for market research.  SSA will only accept electronic responses, which the vendor should submit by April 4, 2007.  Microsoft Word is SSA’s standard word processing software.  The size limitation for email attachments is 10 megabytes.  SSA will not permit faxed information.  SSA is not responsible for any failure to access information.  

Responses may also include comments, recommendations as well as suggestions for additional information.  All responses should be sent via email to: rick.bolt@ssa.gov.  No Phone Calls, Please.  This is not a request for proposal.  A formal solicitation is not available at this time.  Therefore, SSA will not honor or respond to written and/or verbal requests for copies of a solicitation or other information related to this announcement.  SSA will use this information in the assessment of capable sources.  SSA may request a demonstration of the software at their facility in Woodlawn, Maryland.  SSA will not notify respondents of any evaluated results from the data received or demonstrated.

If a solicitation should result from the analysis of the responses, SSA anticipates that such a solicitation will occur sometime during the third or fourth quarter of calendar year 2007.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>M -- Operation and Maintenance of NOAA/NMFS/Newport Field Research Station ? Newport, OR
<DESC>This special notice is issued in accordance with FAR Part 5.201(b)(1)(ii). The Western Region Acquisition Division (WRAD) proposes to extend the existing contract for the Operation and Maintenance of NOAA/NMFS/Newport Field Research Station (NFRS) in Newport, OR (Contract Number 50ABNF200029) with the current contractor, Oregon State University, for a period of up to six months beyond the contract's current expiration date of March 31, 2007. The follow-on requirement for continuation of these services has been solicited on a competitive basis under Solicitation Number AB133F-07-RP-0017. Proposals have been received in response to the solicitation and are currently being evaluated by WRAD. The extension to the current contract is necessary due to the existence of a pending agency protest that is delaying award of the follow-on contract.  Oregon State University operations and maintenance staff is currently mobilized at the NFRS. The time frame available between now and the expiration of the current contract would make it impossible for any entity other than the current contractor to mobilize and ensure the continuity of services for the operation and maintenance of the NFRS.  It is anticipated that the time frame necessary to adjudicate the protest and award the follow-on contract will take no more than six months.  This extension will be utilized on a month to month basis for the amount of time necessary to adjudicate the pending protest and award the follow-on contract. The extension shall not exceed six months.

Questions concerning this proposed action shall be directed to Contracting Officer Paul Reed via telephone at (206) 526-6034 or via email at Paul.J.Reed@noaa.gov.

<SUBJECT>A -- Global Mental Health
<DESC>The National Institute of Mental Health intends to conduct negotiations on a sole - source basis with the University of Michigan for a multi-year contract to provide a variety of assessments on global mental health issues, using the World Mental Health Survey (WMHS) database.  The WMHS database is not publicly available and can not be accessed by 3rd parties. The University of Michigan serves as the WMHS Data Collection Coordination Centre, and is thus in a unique position to provide access to this dataset and to provide first-hand expertise in analyzing the data. 

The WMHS dataset is a collection of nationally or regionally representative population surveys conducted in 26 countries. These data are the only existing source of accurate cross-national information about the prevalence and correlates of mental, substance, and behavioral disorders, in both developed and developing countries. It is also the only source of consistent, population-based cross-national information needed to measure quality adjusted life years (QALYs), the preferred outcome for cost-effectiveness research in health care; specifically, it includes 'standard gamble','time tradeoff', and 'visual analogue scale' measures of respondents' quality of life, as well as unprecedented detail on morbidity and disability. These data will allow NIMH to develop, test and compare different methods of evaluating the impact on quality of life of different mental health and medical conditions; and to relate epidemiology and health care use with country-level measures of health system capacity, spending, and other relevant indicators, e.g., to identify potential policy 'levers' for addressing mental health burden.

The objectives of this contract are to: 1) Update evidence on the burden of mental illness and other disease by implementing and comparing alternative measurement methods; 2) Identify major areas of unmet need for mental health care globally, along with individual and environmental correlates of mental illness and mental health treatment; 3) Develop a research agenda of treatments, delivery strategies, outreach methods, policy planning and implementation, financing and human resource development aimed at reducing unmet needs for mental health treatment globally; and 4) Help identify specific 'leverage points' for educating key stakeholder groups, focusing/targeting public awareness and other types of interventions, and ultimately facilitate access to effective mental health treatment across developed and developing countries. 

The authority to conduct negotiations with only one source (the University of Michigan) is: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(b)(1) and HHSAR 306-302-1(b)(1) -- unique supplies or services available from only one source.

This is not an announcement of the availability of a Request for Proposals, nor is an RFP available.

<SUBJECT>A -- State Mental Health Programs, Policies, and Epidemiology
<DESC>The National Institute of Mental Health intends to conduct negotiations on a sole - source basis with the NASMHPD Research Institute (NRI) for a multi-year contract to improve data resources and knowledge regarding state-level mental health spending, health care use, epidemiology and unmet need. The mental health agencies of all 50 states, 4 U.S. territories and the District of Columbia are represented by a single organization, the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD, and the NASMHPD Research Institute (NRI: http://www.nri-inc.org/) is the only existing source of cross-state data on state mental health programs from all US states and territories, and NRI's databases are not publicly available. Also, NRI is the only organization with established relationships with all (or even most) states for collecting and analyzing mental health-related data. As such, NRI is the only viable source for conducting this work. 

The objectives of this contract are to 1) Develop an initial assessment of the scope and quality of data currently collected by NRI for conducting policy research, and identify priorities for strengthening and extending these data; 2) Conduct cross-state analyses of mental health-related costs, service use, epidemiology and unmet need across multiple relevant state agencies and programs, including analysis of different levels of geographic variation; 3) Work with states to build an initial consortium of states willing to pool mental-health related data for ongoing policy evaluation, and a framework for such pooling; and 4) Develop pooled data from multiple states, for potential use by states for research and policy evaluation. 

The authority to conduct negotiations with only one source (the NRI) is: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(b)(1) and HHSAR 306-302-1(b)(1) -- unique supplies or services available from only one source.

<SUBJECT>A -- Engaging Large Employers Regarding Evidence-Based Mental Health Treatment
<DESC>The National Institute of Mental Health intends to conduct negotiations on a sole - source basis with the National Business Group on Health (NBGH: http://www.businessgrouphealth.org/) for a multi-year contract to engage large employers regarding their employees' mental health treatment and to encourage them to adopt/disseminate current evidence-based mental health practices. Through this contract, the NIMH seeks to engage the largest employers in the U.S. (i.e., Fortune 100/Fortune 500 companies), to identify their current practices regarding mental health and to engage them systematically regarding specific, business-focused steps to facilitate evidence-based practices and improve mental health treatment. 

The NBGH has unique capabilities for conducting this work. In particular, NBGH is the only national organization that specifically represents large employers on health care and health policy issues, and thus has a direct mandate both to solicit and represent the views of large employers and to engage them proactively regarding health and health care; and NBGH is the only health-focused organization whose membership includes a majority of Fortune 100 firms - overall, NBGH's membership directs health benefits for some 55 million Americans, i.e., approximately 1/3 of all Americans with employment-based health insurance. Thus NBGH is the sole organization with the access and mandate needed to conduct this work. 

The objectives of this contract are to: 1) Understand the current mental health benefits strategies within these companies, and their strategies for addressing other health/productivity issues; 2) Understand the receptivity of these large employers to initiating specific new strategies to improve mental health treatment and outcomes, and on barriers to change; 3) Study dissemination of evidence-based practice recommendations for improving mental health treatment and outcomes to individual large employers; and 4) Develop research reports on potential leverage points for engaging large employers, based the findings from the other activities in this contract. 

The authority to conduct negotiations with only one source (the National Business Group on Health) is: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(b)(1) and HHSAR 306-302-1(b)(1) -- unique supplies or services available from only one source.

All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the NIMH.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. RFQ No. 07SQ810094, this solicitation is issued as a request for quotation.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-15. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 423430 with a small business size standard of 100 Employees.  (See Numbered Note 1). The following Justification for Technical Facts Supporting A Request To Enter Into An Acquisition Which Precludes Consideration Of A Product Manufactured By Another Company (FAR 11.105) has been prepared in support of this acquisition: 1. Identification of Agency, Contracting Activity and Document.  Bureau of Reclamation, Chief Information Office, Information Technology (IT) Services Division, Testing and Quality Assurance Group, Denver, Colorado 2. Nature and/or Description of Action Being Approved.  Reclamation would like to purchase maintenance services for 24 Juniper IDP Devices.   3. Description of the Supplies or Services Required to Meet Agency's Need.  Reclamation is in need for Maintenance Services to include technical support (web-based, telephone, & email), repair, replacement, signature releases and operating system upgrades for 24 Juniper Intrusion Detection Protection (IDP) Devices.  These devices currently reside on Reclamation's Network Backbone and provide a layer of network security.  Several of the devices have already experienced expired maintenance. 4. Unique Features of the Proposed Product. The need for Maintenance services is not unique in itself, but maintenance services for the Juniper IDP Devices are.  These devices are already in existence within Reclamation throughout Reclamation's networks.  These devices are used on a 24x7 basis and provide Reclamation a strengthened security stance against possible compromise.  It is imperative that these devices are kept up to date and can be repaired as needed. 5. Evaluation of Other Potential Sources.  No sources for maintenance services have been researched.  Reclamation does not have a preference for where the Juniper IDP Maintenance services are bought only that direct access to Juniper can occur for the services.  For example, we have in the past used an authorized reseller for Juniper IDP Maintenance services but have contacted Juniper directly for technical support.

The Decision Agent™ (DA), Communications Gateway System (CGS), Enhanced Communications Gateway System (ECGS), Mail Room (MR), LMDS, and Message Center are all Proprietary Software Products of NGSC/CMS. The development and support of these products require specific message handling expertise, expert teams of engineering talent, access to the source codes, and an extensive system of product configuration and testing capabilities. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the Technology Refresh of the Departments Alternate Communications Site (ACS) Decision Agent (DA) Computer System. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products and services of another company. The Department has been advised that Northrop Grumman has not certified its proprietary software to run on and be compatible with any other vender’s hardware.   Northrop Grumman’s Decision Agent (DA) software products are tested, certified, and implemented on the IBM X-Series and incorporates its Mail Room and Enhanced Communications Gateway System (ECGS), is used by the Department to provide an alternate command and control messaging capability in the event of a national emergency when the Department’s primary systems would be inoperable. The system has been certified and accredited. Currently all message traffic is backed up to the site, and in the event of an emergency it would allow the principle officers within the Department, and other connected agencies to communicate via secure direct and dial up connections to send and receive official messages. The system is a critical component of the Department’s Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) planning. The project was approved, and funds provided by the Department’s Critical Infrastructure Protection Steering Committee.  This alternate communications capability is vital to the continued accomplishment of mission essential business and support of diplomatic activities worldwide in the event of a catastrophic loss of communications capability at Main State (HST) or the Beltsville Information Management Center (BIMC). The ACS provides assurance that there will be a wide range of survivable communications maintained with Embassies and Consulates around the world. The Alternate Communications Site (ACS) concept addresses the single point of failure and disaster recovery issues that were found to be inadequately supported and provides the Department of State with reasonable and cost effective survivable communications necessary to maintain the Diplomatic Command and Control communications and the interoperability of the Foreign Affairs Community.<BR><BR>The ACS as part of the Global Telecommunications Network has established a survivable telegraphic command & control communications capability with alternate routing provided  by dial-up and leased communications circuitry for more than sixty agencies. IRM requires the Technology Refresh of Northrop Grumman’s Decision Agent (DA), Mail Room, Hardware, and Enhanced Communications Gateway System software products, and includes renewal of the Software Subscription Service Agreement on a brand name only basis.  The software products being supported are proprietary to Northrop Grumman, which has not licensed the software, annual maintenance, or training to any other entity. As this is a brand name only justification, the hardware products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements for a commercially available product for command and control messaging. No other commercially available products are available that could meet the Department’s requirements. The Department intends that DA, Mail Room, and ECGS software will continue to be installed on IBM hardware and operational for at least three years into the future The Department cannot afford to replace the existing products with another vendor’s non-tested / non-certified hardware products.  This Brand Name Hardware procurement will ensure that support for the Northrop Grumman software is renewed for the next three years and is significant in terms of critical infrastructure protection and emergency preparedness.   The nature of this Technology Refresh procurement prevents the Department from considering, at this time, any hardware other than the Northrop Grumman recommended IBM X-Series Servers for which their software products have undergone extensive tests and assessment, evaluation for security testing, and received final Certification and Accreditation. The Information Resource Management, Beltsville Messaging Center, Alternate Communications Site Manager request this requisition be processed as soon as possible.<BR><BR>

The entire Air Force will benefit from total network interoperability, the ability to communicate and transfer information amongst bases, and from the existence and cohesion of personnel already trained and certified in CISCO technology.

current and future programs and initiatives. The Work is subject to the requirements of DoD Instruction 5120.4 and the regulations and instructions incorporated therein by reference.

The content of the Work will include, but not be limited to, features, factual information, articles and images about DARPA’s accomplishments and challenges since its founding in 1958, and information about current and future programs. The vendor will provide qualified, experienced personnel who can work independently and produce the content with minimal reliance on assistance from DARPA’s staff.  The vendor shall develop the 
content, publication’s layout and design.  The vendor will work with the DARPA Public Affairs Office (PAO) to develop topics for the content to be included as a part of the Work.  The vendor will also coordinate with DARPA to obtain existing content and images that may be used as a part of or as a basis for content the vendor is developing.  DARPA will make final approval of all content and publication layout and design. The vendor shall provide draft versions of all content and page layouts for DARPA review at

4. ADVERTISING

The Work will not involve the expenditure of any appropriated or non-appropriated government funds. U.S. Government appropriated funds, non-appropriated funds, government materials, equipment or personnel will not be used to publish, print or distribute the Work. The vendor agrees to bear all costs and expenses of publishing and distributing the Work as provided for herein.  It is expressly agreed that neither the United States Government, the Director of DARPA, his or her representatives and/or successors, nor DARPA shall be liable for any expenses or obligations incurred in publishing or distributing the Work. All costs to the vendor are solely the responsibility of the vendor.  The vendor shall provide proposed advertisements to DARPA for review, and DARPA may disapprove any advertising containing or failing to contain information that is either prohibited or required under federal laws or regulations or this agreement as stated below. The contractor agrees not to include in the Work any advertising of the following types: 

a)	Paid political advertisements for a candidate, party, or which advocate a particular position on a political issue, including advertisements advocating a position on any proposed DoD policy or policy under review, or which advocate lobbying elected officials on a specific issue; 
b)	Advertisements that are contrary to law or to DoD or Military Service regulations or that in the Government's opinion pose a danger or detriment to DoD personnel or their family members, or that interfere with the command or installation or 
DARPA missions;
c)	 Advertisements for gambling activities such as games or lotteries;
d)	Advertisements that are worded or phrased to give the reader the impression that DARPA in any way endorses, guarantees, or sponsors any product or service, or that otherwise implies U.S. Government or DARPA endorsement of any private entity or enterprise; 
e)	Advertising that discriminates or implies discrimination against any person because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, marital status, physical handicap, political affiliation, or any other non-merit factor of the purchaser, user 
or patron;  
f)	Advertisements that are in poor taste, that fail to maintain the professional image of DARPA or that could reasonably be construed as being discrediting to DARPA or DoD;
g)	Advertisements for any establishment declared "off limits" by a National Capital Region military command. 

All proceeds from the sale of advertisements for the Work belong to the publisher, who shall look exclusively to such advertising proceeds to cover all costs and profits associated with the publishing of the Work. The contractor agrees not to enter into any exclusive advertising agreement with any firm, broker, or individual for the purpose of selling advertising associated with this contract or the Work.

5.  DISTRIBUTION

For proposal purposes, the maximum number of copies of the Work is estimated to be 10,000 with approximately 8000 copies directly distributed to DARPA and the remainder distributed to other locations.  However, the final production number may vary. The 
vendor agrees to produce and provide, at no cost to the government, a minimum of 4000 and a maximum of 10,000 copies of the Work for DARPA use.  Additional no-cost copies may be produced and provided based on the mutual agreement of the publisher 
and DARPA.  An electronic copy of the Work, less advertising copy, is to be provided via a CD/DVD in PDF format (Adobe Reader 7.0).  A notional DoD distribution list shall be proposed by the vendor; although, a comprehensive DoD distribution list will be required.

(End of provision)
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for leased office space that will house NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) employees.  The Government’s Baseline requirements are required submittals in the Offeror’s proposal in order for the proposal to be considered for further evaluation.   The Government’s value characteristics, or trade-offs, are not required characteristics in the Offeror’s proposal; however, they are highly encouraged.   The Government contemplates a firm fixed price contract.  The lease will be a twelve month period of performance with two, three month options for a total eighteen month potential period of performance.  BASELINE REQUIREMENTS: The building shall have a minimum of 8,000 square feet.  The building will be a combination of open space and at least eight single offices, with one conference room seating up to 50 people.  The building shall be open to NASA employees from 7:00 am to 7:00 pm.  Parking spaces shall accommodate approximately 50 people. The office shall be identified, at a minimum, as CLASS B office space and shall include a floor plan with the proposal.  CLASS B space is a classification used to describe buildings that generally qualify as a more speculative investment, and as such, command lower rents or sales prices compared to CLASS A properties.  Such buildings offer utilitarian space without special attractions, and have ordinary design, if new or fairly new; good to excellent design if an older non-landmark building.  These buildings typically have average to good maintenance, management and tenants.  They are less appealing to tenants than Class A properties, and may be deficient in a number of respects including floor plans, condition and facilities.  They lack prestige and must depend chiefly on a lower price to attract tenants and investors.    VALUE CHARACTERISTICS: Size: Consideration will be given to proposed buildings in excess of 8,000 square feet with a maximum of 14,000 square feet. Single offices: Consideration will be given to the number of single offices in excess of eight offices. Conference Rooms: Consideration will be given to the number and seating limit of conference rooms. Parking spaces: Consideration will be given to the number of parking spaces in excess of 50 spaces. CLASS A office space: Consideration will be given to CLASS A office space.  CLASS A space is a classification used to describe buildings that generally qualify as extremely desirable investment-grade properties and command the highest rents or sale prices compared to other buildings in the same market.  Such buildings are well located and provide efficient tenant layouts as well as high quality, and in some buildings, one-of-a-kind unique floor plans.  These buildings contain modern mechanical systems, and have above-average maintenance and management as well as the best quality materials and workmanship in their trim and interior fittings.  They are generally the most attractive and eagerly sought by investors willing to pay a premium for quality.  IT Cost Considerations:  1.  Line of Sight: Consideration will be given to proposals that have an unobstructed clear line of sight from the roof of the facility to the roof of Building 45 (the second tallest building on the JSC campus).  This will allow for wireless communications. 2.  North Side of NASA Parkway: Consideration will be given to proposed buildings that are located on the north side of NASA Parkway. This will allow compatibility with other Government communications systems.  3. Copper Wiring: Consideration will be given to proposals that have existing Category 5 copper cabling. This will allow for installation of JSC workstations and phones. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Once leased, the property may undergo minor modifications such as moved walls, doors, electrical outlets, and installation of security systems to accommodate the needs of NASA JSC.  Any prohibitions or restrictions against such modifications shall be expressly stated in the proposal. The Government intends to view the proposed property after receipt of proposals.  Dates and times will be determined with the Offerors after receipt of proposals. INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROPOSAL PREPARATION: Proposal prices shall be identified for the twelve month base period and each three month option.   Prices shall include additional elements that comprise the square footage price such as, but not limited to, overhead, management fees, janitorial fees and utilities.	A description detailing such elements shall be included in the proposal.	 Proposals must be submitted to the Contracting activity identified below by 3 PM CST 3/23/07: NASA JSC Attn: Maria Alberty/BJ3 2101 NASA Parkway Houston, TX 77058 EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS: Selection and award will be made to that offeror whose offer will be most advantageous to the Government, with consideration given to price and other factors considered.  The following trade-offs, or value characteristics, shall be used to evaluate offers: Size of the office space  Number of single offices Number of conference rooms Number of available parking spaces Classification type of the building IT cost considerations It is critical that Offerors provide adequate detail to allow evaluation of their offer.

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-11. Delivery and acceptance will be at Bethesda, Maryland.
The National Institute on Drug Abuse has a requirement for expert in publication of articles. Background: The work includes three specific tasks, 1) editorial assistance with the expeditious publication of manuscripts containing scientific data generated in the Drug Design and Synthesis Section (DDS), Chemical Biology Research Branch (CBRB), NIDA, NIH, DHHS; 2) coordination of the establishment and management of existing and future databases of compounds prepared in DDS and necessary for its work; 3) Coordination and facilitation of the molecular modeling and quantum chemistry programs necessary for DDS.  Sufficient expertise and knowledge is required in these areas to allow efficient interaction with the Chief, DDS. 
To accomplish these tasks: 1) The contractor will discuss with scientists involved with the manuscript how the scientific work should be described to enable publication of a scientific manuscript in first-rate refereed journals, and the various steps that must be followed for the process. The contractor will keep the Chief, DDS, informed as to the progress of the manuscript; 2) Databases that the Chief, DDS, deem necessary for material gathered in the Section will be established under the guidance of the contractor to allow easy access by the Chief, DDS, and the members of the Section; 3) the theoretical chemistry (molecular modeling, quantum chemistry) needed for the work of the Section will be facilitated and overseen, when necessary, by the contractor.Organic/medicinal chemistry and pharmacology are the foundation for the multidisciplinary approach used in DDS research.  The work requires synthesis of novel agonists, antagonists, imaging agents, affinity ligands, and other drugs for specific applications. New, highly selective ligands for drug receptors are synthesized, using all of the contemporary tools of medicinal chemistry, including computer assisted molecular modeling. DDS (1) Plans, develops, and conducts research to obtain and evaluate new compounds for various types of pharmacological activity; (2) promotes the use of molecular modeling and quantum chemistry to determine structure-activity relationships; (3) develops synthetic routes and methodology as required for the design, synthesis, and testing of new therapeutic agents, (4) develops ligands for positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging of drug receptors in the CNS of living animals and conscious humans; and (5) collaborates with other laboratories in the evaluation of new compounds. The data that are obtained from DDS studies are published in first-rate journals. It is essential that the research findings of DDS are made available to scientists, worldwide, through the expeditious publication of research findings, that the necessary databases for essential information be established and maintained, and that important theoretical concepts derived from molecular modeling and quantum chemistry be explained so that the scientists in the Section more fully understand them.  It has been determined that it is cost efficient and in the best interests of the Government to have a contractor perform the three tasks. The provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial, applies to this acquisition. The provision at 52.212-2,Evaluation Commercial Items, is applicable. Specific evaluation criteria are: (1) Ability to meet technical requirements in Journals associated in fields of medical chemistry,organic chemistry and pharmacology (2) past performance with regulation of NIDA,NIH.  Offers will also be evaluated on best value in relation to price. Offerors must include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items, with its offer. Clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Condition Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. Clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  The quotations are due March 28, 2007 3:00 PM Est and will be submitted to Kathleen Gregory, Contract Officer, 31 Center Drive, Room 1B59, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.

Both gates are open Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays.  These gates will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours  and 2100 hours.  These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holidays.  On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, and on other days on which these gates are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I-5 ).  Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtained.  All commercial vehicles will be searched.  The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The Contractor must also allow additional time fo r commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis.  If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as possible and request th at the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority.  On weekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12'-5in clearance) will require a time stamped searched- label to ga in access to North Fort Lewis.  Searched- labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate  guard that their vehicle is over 12'-5in in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a -searched- label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis.  (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lan e except at Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate.  All passengers in  the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes.

Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any  contract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort L ewis more than twice per week.  Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logis tics Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed).  The visitors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor employees if the contractor partici pates in the Fast Access Gate Program.  The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program.  b.  The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history bac kground check (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis.  The contractor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the fast access identification card.  If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee.  If a fast access i dentification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identification badge, the Gov ernment may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.  c.  If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the co ntractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change.  If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day.  An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/she does not have the required identification badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract.  The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, w ith or without advance notice to the contractor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.  d.  Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subc ontractors, or their employees.  If an employees identification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or repro duction is discovered, followed by a written report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered.  e.

The identification badge shall not be used for access to any Governmen t installation except for performance of work under the contract for which it was issued.  f.  The contractor shall, upon expiration or termination of the contract, collect all identification badges and turn them in to the FAGPC. The final invoice will not  be considered proper for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act (FAR 52.232-25 or FAR 52.212-4(i)) until all identification badges have been accounted for.  g.  If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be notified by t he Contracting Officer as to whether the fast access identification cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and which gate(s) may be used for access to the installation.- Local clause 52.111-4004 states:  -In accordance with the FAR Part Two ele ctronic commerce definition and FAR Subparagraph 4.502 (Electronic Commerce in Contracting Policy), the Contractor shall communicate with the Government utilizing electronic mail.-  Quoters are required to submit completed copies of the provisions at FAR 5 2.212-3 and its ALT I, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, and DFARS 252.212-7000, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with their quotes.

UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEM TO SUPPORT WILDFIRE and FOREST INVENTORY ASSESSMENT MAPPING


1.0 	INTRODUCTION

The USDA Forest Service is currently examining the need for a close-range Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) system a.) to provide thermal IR mapping support to wildfire incidents during the 2007 wildfire season, b.) to provide communication relay support to wildfire incidents during the 2007 wildfire season, and c.) to provide a stable platform for forest inventory mapping for a mapping project in Nevada.  The following specifications provide the expected requirements for equipment and operational support in these challenging environments.

Scope

The scope of this performance specification includes the requirements for a complete UAS system over the intended usage period of the system (July through September, 2007).

1.1 	Intended and Desired Use

The primary intended use of the selected UAS system will be to provide tactical thermal imaging and communications support to a wildfire incident command during extended attack.  The site and dates for deployment will be determined during the early stages of the fire season.  The expected location of wildfire incident support will likely be in the Rocky Mountain States and west.

The secondary desired use of the selected UAS system will be to acquire high resolution imagery over selected forest inventory assessment locations in central Nevada.  The exact sites and dates for deployment will be agreed upon by the service vendor and the Forest Service.

In order to support wildfire and forest inventory mapping and monitoring, the following are attributes, features, or goals that are desirable by the Forest Service:

Desired Future Condition:  Ability to interoperate with remote receiver stations currently in use in other ?all risk environments? (i.e., compatibility with Homeland Security and Air National Guard).

Questions and Answers are provided as follows:

1.	Should we quote a computer and printer? If yes, do you have any requirements such as operating system, etc. 

Please quote a computer, no printer. OS to be Windows XP.

2.	A vacuum is required for the dry mode. Should we quote one? 

No vacuum (house vacuum already available).

3.	Since this a wet and dry system do you require automatic switching of modes or is manual change of modules by operator ok? 

Manual switching okay, no specific requirement.

4.	Our model includes imaging capability from 300-2500 microns as standard. Extending the imaging range down to 20 microns is an option. Should this be quoted as an option? 

Not sure of the term “imaging”.  We need to see down to approximately 100 nanometers (we have particles near 250 nm and need to see tails below this level).  If the term “imaging” refers to particle size detection, then we need the lower limit.  If the term imaging refers to some additional means of looking at particle shape (in addition to particle detection), this is not needed.  If the system does not use a light scattering principal, then the first statement is true (we need the lower detection limit).

5.	Our technician checks the instrument using ISO 13320 standards. Would you like an additional supply of ISO 13320 standards quoted? 

No standards needed.

6.	The specified particle size range of .025-2800 microns is specific to the manufacturer Microtrak. Other vendors ranges will vary. Our closest model has a range from .04-2500 microns, has automatic change from wet to dry and includes imaging from 300-2500 microns. Is this acceptable? 

Size range is acceptable.  No imaging needed (unless it is part of the way the instrument does particle size analysis).

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.
(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]: __ it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;

(End of provision)
 
Notice to Offerors:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  

Informal forum with the Ombudsman:  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman:  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.
