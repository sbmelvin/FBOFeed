<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 13.106-1) with Sun Nuclear Corp., 425 Pineda Ct. Suite A, Melbourne, FL 32940, as the ArcCHECK/MapCHECK/RadCalc/Daily QA3 components make up the only radiation dosimetry system that meets the minimum requirements of the government.  The system is the only radiation dosimetry system capable of measuring and analyzing the radiation fluence of a rotation linear accelerator treatment as a function of gantry angle.  This allows for detection of dose delivery errors as a function of beam output, gantry angle and Multi-Leaf Collimator (MLC) segment.  This also allows for detection of beam modifiers or attenuators traversing the treatment beam in only a portion of the arc treatment, e.g., treatment couch support, immobilization device, etc.  Also, the RadCalc program of this system is the only component that can upgrade the current RadCalc program with improved technology.  This acquisition is being conducted under the FAR 13.106-1.  Provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-24 are incorporated.

NMC San Diego has a requirement for a radiation dosimetry system.  The system shall include the following: volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), 4D isotropical cylindrical detector array for rotational delivery QA/dosimetry, two dimensional detector array, independent MU/point dose verification for 3D/IMRT treatment planning systems, an isocentric mounting fixture for array at up to 10cm of water equivalent depth securely in a linac accessory tray, cavity plug insert, power-data interface module, and wireless 13 total ion chambers for daily output.  The system shall be compatible with the new Varian system at NMC San Diego.  The cylindrical diode array shall be capable of measuring and analyzing radiation fluencies as a function of gantry angle for arcs, which allows for increased patient safety in terms of radiation damage to surrounding healthy tissue.

The system shall be compliant with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements to market and deliver medical products for use in the United States of America, even should delivery be requested outside of the United States.  The claims made for the product shall comply with the regulations of the FDA with respect to products for marketing and delivery of a medical product for use in the United States of America, even should delivery be requested outside of the United States.


Items being purchased in this acquisition:
Radiation Dosimetry System (1)

This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures.  There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 334519 with a Small Business Size Standard of 500 employees.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement.  However, parties interested in responding to this notice shall submit technical data, including cost, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same product. All capability statements received by closing of this notification of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

Based on the above information, the only technically acceptable system is provided by Sun Nuclear Corporation.

Submit email capability statements (using PDF, MS Word, Excel attachments) to Courtney Piar at Courtney.piar@med.navy.mil. Fax quotes may be sent to 301-619-1132 Attn: Courtney Piar. Email statements are preferred. Statements are due not later than 1:00 P.M. EST on 06 July 2010. No phone calls accepted
