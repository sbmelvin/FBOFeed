S. Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republ ic of the Marshall Islands.  The contract also includes requirements for participation in Partnering efforts and provision of Strategic Planning Services. The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers will utilize this contract for its purchase requirements for packag ed ice in performance of its responsibilities for man-made or natural emergency or disaster response and recovery activities under the Federal Response Plan, and reserves the right, at its discretion, to utilize this contract for other packaged ice require ments when necessary.  Time is of the essence in performance of this contract, as this ice is required to sustain life in the aftermath of disasters that have or will disrupt the normal source of refrigeration in the disaster location.  Therefore, this con tract requires immediate response, with timely production, delivery, and reporting by the Contractor.   The Contractor may be required to respond to simultaneous disasters with deliveries to multiple sites for each disaster.  In order to meet the intent of the Stafford Act, the Contractor shall give preference to the extent feasible and practicable in meetin g its subcontracting and hiring requirements with those organizations, firms, and individuals residing or doing business primarily in the area affected by the disaster.  The performance period for this contract is for a one - year base period from February  1, 2003 through January 31, 2004, with two one-year option periods.  (At the option of the Government, the contract period may be extended for two additional years.) The contractor will be required to submit daily production and product delivery reports t hrough an automated system.  That data will be verified through acceptance reports from Government personnel at the receiving locations.  The contractor will be required to provide copies of State/local inspection reports, and permits for all producers/pla nts.  The contractor will be further required to provide periodic reports relative to hiring and subcontracting in the disaster location to monitor compliance with the Stafford Act.

If a business has not been in existence for 12 months, number of employees means the average employment of such concern and its affiliates during the period that such concern has been in existence based on the number of persons employed during each of the pay periods of the period that such concern has been in business.  If a business has acquired an affiliate during the applicable 12-month period, it is necessary, in computing the applicants number of employees, to include the affiliates number of em ployees during the entire period, rather than only it s employees during the period in which it has been an affiliate.  The employees of a former affiliate are not included, even if such concern had been an affiliate during a portion of the period.  The solicitation will be made available on compact Disk (CD- ROM) and will be provided free of charge, on or about November 12, 2002.

The offeror may provide information on past performance of predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or subcontractors that will perform major or criti cal aspects of the contract. If no relevant past performance information is available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. The information presented in the offeror's proposal, together with that from other source s available to the Government, will provide the input for the evaluation of this factor.       		(c) Subfactor 3.  The Government will subjectively evaluate the qualifications of key personnel to determine their technical capability and experience in performance of work similar in scope and size (monetary and level of effort), as required in t he proposed contract.  		(2) Factor 2, Capability to  Perform.   			(a) Subfactor l.  The Government will evaluate the offeror's capability to simultaneously respond to multiple disaster locations and multiple delivery sites within those locations; how the contractor will ensure quality control of all performance; the c apability of the offeror to provide real time data on production and delivery of ice; computer hardware and software, other office equipment and communication capabilities to be utilized in contract performance, and the contractors plan for training to ma intain an effective organization. 			(b) Subfactor 2.  The Government will evaluate the depth and size of the offeror's organization relative to capability to perform under this contract. 			(c) Subfactor 3.

To evaluate the price proposal, offerors are required to provide a breakout of pricing for all items in the base year of the contract.  Option year prices may be submi tted as single line item prices with no breakout.

<DESC>Overview

This is a Request for Information (RFI) in support of the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) Information Technology (IT) competitive sourcing study being conducted under Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 and Supplemental Handbook (hereinafter referred to collectively as OMB Circular A-76). 

The DoDEA IT activity encompasses four regions:  DoDEA Headquarters located in Arlington, VA (hereinafter DoDEA HQ), Department of Defense Elementary and Secondary Schools (regional headquarters located in Atlanta, GA and schools located throughout the southeastern United States as well as New York, Puerto Rico and Guam) (hereinafter DDESS), Department of Defense Dependent Schools-Europe (DoDDS-Europe) (regional headquarters located in Wiesbaden, Germany and K-12 schools located throughout Europe), Department of Defense Dependent Schools-Pacific (DoDDS-Pacific) (regional headquarters located in Okinawa, Japan and K-12 schools located in Japan and Korea) (hereinafter collectively referred to as regions).  The regions require IT services and Administrative Technology (AT) support services at both educational and administration locations worldwide.

The type of services that will be required of the successful Service Provider (SP) include: 

?	Technical support and advice for all worldwide DoDEA schools, district offices, area offices, headquarters offices and related facility administrative and data processing systems
?	Perform DoDEA network installation, administration, upgrading, maintenance and troubleshooting on Local Area Network (LAN), Wide Area Network (WAN), Campus Area Network (CAN) and Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
?	Perform workstation installation, administration, maintenance, upgrading and troubleshooting
?	Provide direction and advice to administrative and educational staff at DoDEA sites
?	Serve as network administrator at DoDEA sites
?	Assist in planning for future development of worldwide DoDEA schools and facilities
?	Ensure coordination with all other DoDEA IT support personnel.

 

Specific request for information

DoDEA requests that industry carefully review the draft PWS and offer comments.  Comments that do not include a reference to the applicable portion of the draft PWS may not be considered.  In preparing the Performance Work Statement and other solicitation documentation for the A-76 study, the government is requesting input from all interested parties in the following areas:

Scope of the study

The current study encompasses work wide performance of IT and AT services.  They government is requesting input from all interested parties on the benefits and/or risks associated with an approach that contemplates both an option to perform a signgle provider cost comparison for the entire requirement as well as an option to conduct four separate cost comparisons for DoDEA HQ, DoDDS-Europe, Dodds-Pacific and DDESS.  Please provide comments on the use of the following process:

To accommodate the complex nature of this study and to afford a competitive opportunity to all commercial entities to include small businesses, the function under study has been divided into four regional requirements (DoDEA HQ, DoDDS-Europe, DoDDS-Pacific, DDESS).  However, because the intent of performing a commercial activity study is to gain the maximum attainable cost and performance efficiencies for the function under study, the government may also consider a single service provider for the entire IT function.  For these reasons the Government is considering the following two approaches to this study.

The first approach requires that the Government Management Plan (GMP) team prepare a management plan and an In-House Cost Estimate (IHCE) for the Most Efficient Organization (MEO) that supports the primary approach of a separate service providers a for each of the four regions.  Secondly, the GMP team will prepare a management plan and an IHCE for an alternative single service provider (one service provider for all regions performing under a single contract).  All management plans (for the regional approach and the single service provider consolidated approach) will be sealed by the contracting officer.

Industry offers will be solicited to support each of the regional requirements.  In addition, industry will be encouraged to submit alternate proposals supporting a single provider approach.  The following statement (or something substantially similar) will be included in the solicitation:

 ?The government intends to either select four individual and independent offers, one for each region, or select a single alternate offer for a consolidated activity, depending upon which scenario offers the best value to the Government cost and performance factors.  Should four independent offers be selected, there will be four independent cost comparisons conducted to evaluate if government MEO performance or industry performance is most advantageous in accordance with OMB Circular A-76 guidelines.  Individual contract awards by region will be made if the industry offers are determined to be most advantageous.?  

If selection of individual offers for each region be determined to offer the best value approach after industry competition, the GMP for each region will be opened and compared to each of the selected industry offers.  If the single consolidated alternative is determined to offer the best value to the government under industry competition, the GMP for a single consolidated function will be opened and compared to the industry offer in accordance with OMB Circular A-76 instructions.

 
Industry days 

The government is contemplating hosting ?industry days? to obtain input from all interested parties as well as to provide further information and insight into the requirements under study.  The government anticipates holding from one to four industry days.  It is anticipated that there will be an industry day held in each of the four regions under study.  Comments on this plan are welcome.

What could the government do or include in this study/procurement that would provide incentives for small business participation (e.g. contract type, award incentives, performance incentives, or some other type of incentive)? 

Contract types

Understanding that this is an international effort being studied under OMB Circular A-76, what type of contract would you support as being the most appropriate for this effort (i.e. Cost Plus, Fixed Price, Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery, or Hybrid)?

If you believe a hybrid type of contract is most appropriate, please give an example of how you would recommend structuring the contract type.

Transition period

How should the transition period be considered?  Should the government mandate a timeframe for the transition or should offerors be allowed to propose individual transitions?

Should transition be considered part of the selection criteria?

Project Summary: The scope of services under this proposed contract includes elevator replacement; HVAC work; upgrades to the electrical system; sidewalk vault repairs; and installation of an emergency generator.  The building will remain fully occupied by various Federal tenants, and it will be the contractor?s responsibility to phase and coordinate all work around these tenants. The estimated cost of construction falls within the range of $5.0 million to $10.0 million, with anticipated construction duration of approximately twenty-one (21) months.  Funds are currently available for this acquisition.  Procurement Type and Methodology: A firm, fixed-price contract is contemplated.  Contractor selection will be in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15.3 for Source Selection procedures and the Best Value Trade-off process.  For this procurement, the following technical factors, when combined, are more important than cost or price.  When technical factors are equal between offerors, price becomes more important.  1. Past Experience with Similar Projects, 2. Past Performance on Similar Projects,  3. Qualifications of Key Subcontractors, and 4. Management Plan and Project Schedule.   Proposal Requirements and Selection Process: Proposals will be evaluated using a two-stage, Source Selection process. Under Stage 1, offerors will submit technical proposals (demonstrating qualifications, past experience, references, personnel, and resources that clearly address the evaluation factors identified in the Request for Proposal (RFP) and price proposals in separate envelopes.  The evaluation factors summarized above will be used in Stage 1 to evaluate technical proposals and determine a competitive range of the most highly qualified firms that will be invited to participate in an oral presentation to take place in Chicago, IL, tentatively January 14th, 2003.  Further narrowing of the competitive range may result based on the results of the interviews.  In Stage 2, the price proposals submitted during Stage 1 will be evaluated for the firms in the competitive range.  Negotiations will be conducted if necessary, but the Government reserves the right to make an award based on initial proposals without holding discussions.  The final selection will be made based on Best Value.  Small Business Requirements:  This procurement for Building Alterations falls under NAICS code 233320 and, as such, is open to both large and small business concerns in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  The small business size standard for this work category is $27.5 million.  Although this procurement is open to large business firms, small, small woman-owned, small minority-owned, small HUBZone, and small Veteran-Owned (including Service Disabled Veteran-Owned firms) are strongly encouraged to participate.  Large businesses will be required to provide the maximum practical opportunities to small, small woman-owned, HUBZone small, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and Veteran-Owned small business concerns through participation as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.  In Stage 2 of this process, each large business in the competitive range will be required to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan in compliance with the minimum acceptable subcontracting target goals set by the Small Business Administration (SBA).  (Small businesses are not subject to this requirement.)  Firms seeking consideration for this contract shall demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the highest subcontracting goals for the concerns mentioned above.

<DESC>The NOAA is interested in obtaining information from organizations that are currently  conducting  financial assistance program for a competitive grant selection process. (NOTE: THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL).  Of specific interest is organizations that are currently coordinating, announcing,  receiving, disseminating, evaluating, and the tabulation of scores for those applications.  There are various types of competition; such as: GROUP COMPETITION,  that in which all applications are grouped together to compete with one another and are ranked in order of the independent reviewers' scores.   INDIVIDUAL COMPETITION, is a review where each single application is judged individually to determine its qualifications based on published criteria  (e.g.,  the notice may stipulate that the first complete applications received that meet the minimum published requirements will be approved until the available funds are exhausted).  The minimum requirements for each selection category are listed below.  

[Note:  The Program Office may also implement additional tiers of internal reviews between the independent or technical review and the final selection stage as long as the additional internal reviews are described in the Federal Register notice and any other alternative publications along with the evaluation and selection criteria.] 
	
Group Competition.  Based solely on independent reviewers' evaluation and scoring of each complete application which was received in accordance with the requirements of the notice, the Program Office must prepare a rank ordering of the applications.  The selecting official must use the evaluation and other selection criteria published in the solicitation as the standard by which applications will be measured when making recommendations to determine successful applicants.  The selecting official must prepare a package that demonstrates that the process is in compliance with the procedures published in the Federal Register or in the program regulations and summarizing the results of the competitive review that consists of the following documentation:   
	
a.	Copy of authorizing legislation and appropriations act (only relevant pages);  
	
b.	Copy of the Federal Register notice which solicited applications; 

c.	Citation for and copy of evaluation criteria used, if not included in Federal Register notice;
	
d.	Copy of any review instructions and checklists and/or other review documents provided to the independent reviewers;
	
e.	List of reviewers (may be coded to protect the privacy of the reviewers);
	
f.	List of all applications/proposals received;
	
g.	List of all applications/proposals rejected and the reason(s) for rejection;
	
h.	List by rank order of the results of the merit review of applications/proposals by the independent reviewers, to include reviewers' scores and the average score of each application;
	
i.	List of applications/proposals selected and recommended for funding by the selecting official and the reason as allowed by the published criteria for selection, including justification for funding application if out of rank order;

j.	A copy of Federal Assistance Law Division comments, if any, and the Program Officer's response; and

k.	Identification of the selecting official.  

Individual Qualification.

<DESC>SUBJECT: COMMERCIALIZATION OPPORTUNITY FOR MERCURY MEASUREMENT
  TECHNOLOGY
DESC: The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) intends to license   two (2) technologies related to the measurement of mercury in gases: 1) a method to compensate for interferences to mercury measurement in gases (patent number 5,750,992) and, 2) a gas-phase mercury reduction method to permit the measurement of total mercury in exhaust gases (patent number 5,879,948). The two technologies can be integrated into a mercury continuous emissions monitoring system for accurate, real-time measurement and speciation of mercury in gases. Potential licensees should express interest in the technologies in writing by mail or fax to TVA no later than NOVEMBER 25, 2002, including proposed license terms and a brief statement of your experience and capabilities to commercialize the technology.  As resources permit, TVA's Environmental Research and Services staff will be available on a fee basis for technology engineering and commercialization support. TVA will entertain proposals for both the exclusive and non-exclusive licensing of the technology.  Reply and requests for additional information should be directed to Tracey R.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Puget Sound is conducting an A-76 Commercial Activities Study, involving FISC Puget Sound Physical Distribution support. The effort involves the performance of physical warehouse work, such as receiving, inspecting, stocking, conducting physical inventories, issuing materials, accepting material returns, kitting, traffic management, and special events support. The work generally does not include related work of managing files, processing requisitions, and providing inventory management. Also it generally does not include heavy packing, shipping, and transporting materials. Commodities handled can vary widely. Commodities can range in size and weight to include extremely large, heavy, or bulky items.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) intends to negotiate with the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research to continue the maintenance of the NHLBI chimpanzee colony for hepatitis and AIDS research. Of the 45 chimpanzees in the colony, 34 are on various investigative programs related to hepatitis and AIDS projects. Most of these projects have long term goals and objectives and some of them have reached a critical phase and others will enter into that phase in the near future. Therefore, any attempt to relocate the colony will not only interrupt critical aspects of the study but is also likely to adversely affect the outcome of ongoing studies. The period of performance is May 1, 2003 - April 30, 2013. The authority to use other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1. The incumbent has been performing work under this contract and, therefore, has unique capability to provide the required services to the NHLBI without disruption of ongoing research and, more importantly, without any deleterious impact in the health and well-being of the chimpanzees. See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>Background

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) through its High Temperature Superconductivity (HTS) Program works in partnership with U.S. universities and industry to establish HTS as a major, competitive contributor to the U.S. electric energy supply. The Program sponsors research and development that will help the United States realize substantial economic, environmental, and energy security benefits. The research must support Superconductivity for Electric Systems Program milestones, research objectives, and long-term goals. Information on the Superconductivity for Electric Systems Program can be found at URL: http://www.eren.doe.gov/superconductivity/.

The coated conductor approaches for fabricating the textured, buffered metal tapes in lengths include the rolling-assisted, biaxially textured substrate (RABiTS) approach pioneered by Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the ion beam assisted deposition (IBAD) technique perfected by Los Alamos National Laboratory and also being researched by Argonne National Laboratory. In addition, laboratory-scale samples of templates have been made by the inclined substrate deposition (ISD) process at Argonne National Laboratory.

The textured template consists of a metal tape covered by one or more buffer layers.   Electron beam evaporation, solution-based (metal-organic deposition, also referred to as non-vacuum), sputtering, pulsed laser, and chemical vapor deposition techniques for deposition of the buffer layer(s) and the YBCO layer have been demonstrated on relatively short (1-10-m) lengths of textured metal substrates to produce high critical current densities.  Other processes are in an earlier stage of development (viz., pulsed electron deposition). The YBCO is typically coated with silver for environmental as well as electrical stabilization.  Key parameters that are important for research on processing of such tapes in long lengths are manufacturing cost and performance, where performance properties may be further subdivided into mechanical properties and electrical performance measured as a function of temperature, applied magnetic field, and mechanical strain.

OVERALL GOAL

The goal of the effort described  proposed for a competitive solicitation is to enable processing in the United States of continuous lengths of RE-123 coated conductor wire possessing all of the following minimum performance characteristics:

1.  Current carrying capability of 300 A per centimeter width (77 K, self field).
2.  Engineering critical current density (Je) in excess of 1 x 104 A/cm2 (3 T, 65 K), including a passivation/stabilization layer covering the RE-123.
3.  Minimum piece length: 100-m.
4.  Width, thickness, stabilization layer, and mechanical strength commensurate with cable and magnet systems manufacturing needs.
5.  Operating temperature range: 25-77 K, depending upon the application.
6.  Projected wire price for large volume manufacture <$50/kA-m (at 50,000 kA-m/year manufacturing rate).

Minimum Tasks Required and Task Titles

The following five tasks will be the minimum required tasks for any proposal submitted in response to a formal Request for Proposals to be issued at a later date, if pursued.  Applicant may choose to include additional tasks in the proposal.  Applicant shall provide a concise description of the following for each task proposed, including identifying the roles of any partner(s) for each task:

Task 1:  Process Research and Development: Textured Template 
Task 2:  Process Research and Development:  Superconductor Growth
Task 3: Process Research and Development: Passivation, Stabilization, Joining, and Insulation
Task 4:  Analysis, Conductor Design, and Measurements for Electric Power Applications
Task 5:  Provision of RE-BCO HTS Tapes 
Additional Tasks

Companies may propose additional tasks, at their option, believed to be necessary for satisfactory performance of the project.

SCHEDULE

A maximum of 36 months effort may be proposed.  Effort must be subdivided into phases, as described below.

Phase I:  First 12 months
Phase II (if proposed):  Months 13 though 24
Phase III (if proposed):  Months 25-36

If pursued, the competitive solicitation for research and development would be open to all US based, industrial applicants, in order to encourage the broadest possible participation.  If pursued, the solicitation would involve the award of an estimated $2M per year subject to the availability of funds from the US Department of Energy.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  All proposals would be subject to merit review by peer evaluation.  Merit review will be based upon the applicant?s research and development concept and plan, capabilities and facilities, and analysis and proposed benefits.  Minimum 50% cost share will be required from non-Federal sources.

Interested parties MUST submit, by email, an expression of interest to Lance Copeland, Subcontract Administrator, at copelandlb@ornl.gov, by close of business November 18, 2002.  The email should contain (a) the company name (b) point of contact including name, email address, telephone number, and US mail address.

This announcement is not a Request for Proposals and shall not be construed as a commitment by Oak Ridge National Laboratory, UT-Battelle, LLC, or the US Government to award a subcontract or subcontracts at this time.

This is a Commercial CONUS Closed-Loop Re-Refined Oil Program Fixed Price/EPA Requirements Type Corporate Contract Solicitation, intended to put in place a follow-on contract to the current contract SP0450-98-D-4043 [due to expire 07Feb03]. PURPOSE: The purpose of this Closed-Loop Re-Refined Oil Program is to assist U.S. Federal and Military installations in complying with EO 12873 and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) with regards to the use, recycling, and disposal of Re-Refined Oil. This Closed-Loop Re-Refined Oil Program will be accomplished by supplying re-refined oil to installations (one of the Affirmative Procurement Program Items under RCRA) and providing for pick-up and re-refining of Used Oil. RE-REFINED OIL PRODUCT: The Offeror must provide the following grades of Engine Oil, produced from re-refined base stock, in accordance with (IAW) the corresponding documents: SAE 10W30 IAW A-A-52039B; SAE 15W40 IAW A-A-52306A; 15W40 IAW MIL-PRF-2104G; SAE 80W90 AIW MIL-PRF-2105E. The Offeror must furnish proof that all Engine Oil provided contains a minimum of 25% re-refined base stock.

The contractor shall also responsible for coordinating the collection of Used Oil with the delivery of bulk shipments to the proper customer point of contact, as designated by the base, camp, or station. This Closed-Loop Program consists of a customer order placement for specific NSNs, pickup of Used Oil (at no additional cost from Contractor) from said customer, re-refinement of Used Oil received, and disposal of contaminated oil IAW environmental rules and regulations. The quantity oil for pick up may vary significantly from the amount of new oil ordered. For quantities of 55 gallons or more, the customer would simply call the nearest contractor location at least 48 hours in advance of needed pick-up. The contractor will then pick up the Used Oil within this 48-hour time frame. The oil will subsequently be returned to the successful re-refined oil contractor for re-refining purposes. The contractor must dispose of all excess oil that is incapable of being re-refined in accordance with (IAW) all Environmental Laws and Regulations. Offeror must be able to recover the Used Oil from underground storage tanks, above ground storage tanks, and 55-gallon drums. Frequency of Used Oil collection shall be on an as needed basis. All collection, re-refining, and disposal of product by the contractor shall be performed at no additional cost to the customer. The Contractor is required to compile and submit quarterly reports to the COR (contracting Officers Representative). These reports shall provide information on the delivery of Re-Refined Oil and pick-up of Used Oil during the said quarterly period. This information shall be broken down by location and quantity in order to facilitate environmental tracking requirements. The Contractor shall agree to assume all liability, under the applicable environmental statutes, arising from the improper disposal, use, or sale of the used motor oil picked up from the participating facilities, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the contract. Contractor shall assume complete and total responsibility for all Used Oil, from commencement of oil pumping (in the Contractor?s possession), through final disposition of the Used Oil. Complete and total responsibility includes full and complete compliance with all EPA, Federal, State, and Local Laws, Codes, Regulations, and Requirements of this Statement of Work (SOW), whether incorporated by reference or specified elsewhere in this SOW or contract document. The prime contractor shall be responsible to completely absolve the Government, including the contracting activity named in a contract award and/or the designated military using activity named in a delivery order and/or contract call requiring delivery and/or pick-up services, from any and all costs attributable to the prime contractor?s and/or its sub-contractor?s (s?) failure to fully and completely comply with all SOW (Statement of Work) and contract requirements.

<DESC>SSA-RFP-03-0512, EVALUATION OF THE TICKET TO WORK PROGRAM - PART A AND PART B.  The Ticket to Work program began implementation in 2002 with the mailing of Tickets to Ticket-eligible DI and SSI beneficiaries in first-round implementation states over the five months from February to June.  Ticket implementation will proceed to second-round implementation states approximately nine months later.  Tickets will be mailed to Ticket-eligible DI and SSI beneficiaries in the remaining states approximately nine months after the second-round implementation states.  This project implements an evaluation of the impact of the Ticket to Work Program.  The evaluation was designed by the Lewin Group, Inc., in association with Cornell University and Westat, under contract to the Social Security Administration (SSA). The overall Evaluation of the Ticket to Work Program is broken into two parts.  PART A will prepare data files from SSA administrative data and conduct the adequacy of incentives evaluation, process evaluation, participation analysis, and impact/outcomes analyses.  PART B will conduct the national surveys of SSA disability beneficiaries, which will include collecting the data, preparing the data files, and preparing documentation.  Coordination between the Part A and Part B Contractors is critical to the success of the overall Evaluation.  The Project Directors and project teams must work together to ensure success both individually and collectively.   The national survey of SSA disability beneficiaries will collect critical data for addressing evaluation issues specified in the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act, such as service utilization, consumer satisfaction, and adequacy of provider incentives to serve the SSA disabled population.  The survey will consist of four, nationally representative cross-sections of Ticket-eligible (and soon-to-be Ticket-eligible) Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) beneficiaries, including Ticket participants.  These cross sections will be supplemented with cross-section surveys of Ticket participants in early, middle, and late Ticket implementation states.  The cohort of Ticket participants in the early implementation states will be followed up longitudinally.  In all, four annual rounds of interviews will be conducted.  These survey data, combined with SSA administrative data, form the key data sources for the evaluation.   The process evaluation will use SSA administrative data and data from the Program Manager (PM) contractor (Maximus, Inc.) combined with qualitative data collected through site visits, telephone interviews, and focus groups with Employment Networks (ENs), the PM, and SSA.  The purpose of the process evaluation is to document how the program was implemented, assess the effect of the program on the market for employment-related services, and provide contextual information to help interpret impact analysis findings.   The participation analysis will use administrative and survey data to assess who participates and who does not, whether nonparticipation is voluntary or involuntary, the relationship between participation, beneficiary characteristics, and area characteristics, and reasons for non-participation. In particular, the participation analysis will examine the extent to which hard-to-serve groups have adequate access to services.  The impact and outcomes analysis will use administrative data to estimate the net and gross impacts of the Ticket to Work Program on employment, earnings, program participation, benefits, and program costs.  A nonexperimental design incorporating multiple comparison groups will be used to estimate the impacts.  Statistical methods will be used to adjust for differences in beneficiary and environmental characteristics.  Survey data will be used to make comparisons between Ticket participants and nonparticipants on additional outcomes of interest that are not measured in the administrative data.  The primary evaluation objective is to determine the net impact of the Ticket to Work initiative as compared to the results that would occur under the current system.  The Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act also requires the evaluation of several specific aspects of the program and outcomes. The evaluation will examine the total and net costs of the program, the individual and service provision characteristics affecting return-to-work, the employment outcomes for participants, the characteristics of service providers and provider networks, the appeal of the program among the eligible population, the adequacy of the initial Ticket incentive structure in providing services to interested SSA beneficiaries, and the satisfaction of participants with the program in general.  The evaluation will also provide feedback to policymakers through periodic reports detailing data collection, findings and recommendations for program modifications.  The government anticipates the award of 1-2 cost-reimbursement type contracts for a 5-year period of performance (offerors may propose on Part A only, Part B only, or on both Parts A and B.  If an offeror submits a combined proposal for both Parts A and B, the government reserves the right to make an award for Part A only or Part B only if it is in the government?s best interest to do so.  An offeror that submits a bid for Part A only or Part B only cannot appear as a subcontractor on another offeror?s proposal). The RFP will be available for downloading on or about November 13, 2002 via the Federal Procurement website: www.fedbizopps.gov.  HARD COPIES WILL NOT BE MAILED.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

However to minimize logistical considerations it is desired that the 18 inch CPFD and the LSD 18 inch module be identical.  The SOW will be revised to delete the requirement for controls on the rear for the V1 and V2 18? and 21? CFPDs. The controls shall be placed on the front for the V1 and V2 18? and 21? CFPD.  See paragraphs 3.1.4.11 and 3.1.4.12.  57. 	Q: Can the requirement for a 3.5? floppy disk drive be removed from the NCU-RISC?  A: The requirement for an internal 3.5? floppy can be satisfied by an external 3.5 inch 1.44 MB floppy disk drive.   141. 	Q: Can the requirement for dual link DVI-I be changed to single link DVI-I for the 18? CFPD?  A: Yes single link is more currently more widely available in the commercial marketplace.

<DESC>Program Research and Develop Announcement (PRDA) 
for Ship Disposal Solutions

Description:

THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS TO REPLACE AND SUPERCEDE THE ORIGINAL ATTACHMENT A (LIST OF SHIPS) WITH THE ATTACHMENT A INCLUDED HEREIN.

The Maritime Administration (MARAD) is seeking innovative engineering/technical/ production/management solutions for the disposal of multiple obsolete vessels located in the reserve fleet sites in the James River, VA; Suisun Bay, CA; and Beaumont, TX.  A complete listing of obsolete vessels is attached for informational purposes as Attachment A.  The list of ships (Attachment A) is subject to change.  Some listed ships (and/or components of listed ships) may be subject to a hold or not available status due to commitments for sales, loans, and donations which were made prior to procurement actions associated with this PRDA announcement.  MARAD anticipates that the obsolete vessels in the worst condition, many of which are located in the James River Reserve Fleet, will be disposed of using traditional competitive contracting practices, depending on the availability of funding.  A draft Request for Proposal (RFP) has been issued to solicit industry comments to that end.

In an effort to obtain maximum program flexibility, the Government is seeking, from public and private concerns innovative solutions for the disposal of the remaining obsolete vessels by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2006.  The use and/or development of Government facilities is not excluded.


Criteria for Evaluating/Selecting Proposals:
Proposals in response to the PRDA must address, at a minimum, the following:

Innovative engineering/technical/production/management approaches for the disposal of obsolete vessels identified in Attachment A
Environmental and worker safety/health considerations associated with the disposal of obsolete vessels and the abatement of hazardous materials
Production throughput/capacity with schedule and funding/cost relationships
Offerors' requisite and relevant experience with the disposal of obsolete vessels
Funding requirements associated with the proposed approach

In evaluating the offerors' submissions, the Government will consider the following criteria, listed in relative order of importance: 

Feasibility and likelihood of success of engineering/technical/management approach for the disposal of obsolete vessels identified in Attachment A and the risks associated with the proposed approach
Productivity of the proposed approach(s) including schedule/cost assessments
Type and sufficiency of proposed environmental, worker safety and health considerations proposed and compliance with applicable laws
Type and sufficiency of proposed abatement of hazardous materials and compliance with applicable laws
Depth, relevance and currency of requisite experience with the complete disposal of obsolete vessels
Realism and reasonableness of proposed funding requirements/costs when compared to the proposed engineering/technical/management solution


In selecting proposed solution(s), the Government will evaluate the overall best value to the Government, considering innovative technical solution(s) meeting the above listed minimum criteria at a reasonable price.   

Historically, the annual program level associated with MARAD ship disposal has been $10 million. The PRDA process permits the Government to evaluate each proposal on its own merit and potentially negotiate implementation of a Pilot Program(s) for proof of concept/methodology, as well as provide justification for budgetary purposes to support a proposed program.  Unlike procedures associated with unsolicited proposals, submissions made under the PRDA will not be advertised/competed.  Based on the evaluation results and budgetary constraints, the Government may choose to select none, part of, or proposal(s) in their entirety to implement innovative solutions offered. 

Instructions for the Preparation of Proposals:
To be given evaluation consideration, submissions in response to this PRDA must conform to the following standards:

1. Technical/engineering/production/management solutions, inclusive of the listing below,  shall not exceed 25 typewritten pages, single sided, single spaced, Arial, 12 pitch:
Production throughput/capacity
Environmental considerations
Worker safety and health considerations
Hazardous abatement considerations
Requisite experience

2. Funding/pricing requirements must be proposed in sufficient enough detail to show all anticipated costs associated with the complete dismantlement of the vessel(s), including cost categories such as towing, remediation of hazardous materials, labor costs etc, as appropriate. Pricing information must be detailed enough to permit the Government to make a determination of cost realism and reasonableness when assessed against the proposed approach. 
Submission of pricing information shall not exceed 3 typewritten pages, single sided, single-spaced, Arial, 12 pitch.

Individual offeror's may submit multiple proposals.  Proposals must be separable and each in accordance with the above criteria.

 Instructions for the Submission of Proposals:
Initial responses to this PRDA must be submitted not later than 2:00 pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) on November 18, 2002 to:

	U.S. Department of Transportation
	Maritime Administration
	Office of Acquisition, MAR-380
	400 Seventh Street S.W., Room 7310
	Washington DC 20590
	Attn: Michael Delaney

Offerors must submit five (5) complete copies for each proposed approach, inclusive of  technical/engineering/production/management and funding/pricing proposals. Electronic submissions will not be accepted.  

It is the intent of the Maritime Administration that this notice be valid until 1 year from the initial date of posting, unless otherwise canceled/amended. 

Submission address remains unchanged for subsequent proposals. 

Questions regarding this PRDA must be submitted in writing via e-mail to the following Internet address:
				rilla.gaither@MARAD.dot.gov OR michael.delaney@marad.dot.gov

NOTE:  THE SUBJECT LINE OF THE E-MAIL SHALL READ PRDA Questions

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intends to negotiate with the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), Atlanta, Georgia, to use "research value mapping" methods (Bozeman and Kingsley, 1999) to review the effectiveness and efficiency of the National Cooperative Program for Infertility Research (NCPIR), a research centers program managed by the Reproductive Sciences Branch of the NICHD Center for Population Research.  The overall purpose of the review is to determine if the NCPIR is achieving its three principal goals of research, training, and community outreach.  The overall review objectives are to:  (1) examine the three NCPIR centers as a "national resource" for the infertility research community; (2) determine the program's capacity to form linkages with other center/network programs and how the program influences other researchers in the reproductive sciences; (3) assess the capability of the centers to train clinician-scientists and contribute to their career trajectories in infertility research; and (4) study the organization and structure of the NCPIR centers compared with similar NIH and non-NIH research programs, and how the NCPIR structure can be changed to influence program outcomes.  To accomplish these objectives, however, the NICHD will use three specific data collection and analysis strategies, pioneered as the "research value mapping" methods for scientific program analysis.  These include: (1) case studies of the NCPIR research centers, including a comparative analysis of other research center case studies performed by Georgia Tech; (2) a survey of the principal users of research products (publications and new technologies) created by the NCPIR research centers, employing the concept of the "knowledge value alliance" (Bozeman, Dietz, and Gaughan, 1999), as a sampling strategy and analytic framework; (3) a research training analysis performed by coding and analyzing the curriculum vitae of researchers and research fellows affiliated with the NCPIR centers (Dietz, Chompalov, Bozeman, O'Neil Lane, and Park, 2000).  The corporate capability of offerors to perform the NCPIR review will be evaluated on four criteria:  (1) knowledge of "research value mapping" methods developed at the School of Public Policy, Georgia Tech, including an understanding of the concepts of "knowledge value alliance" and "scientific and technical human capital"; (2) experience in applying case study methods to research center programs and comparing organization and structural properties with that obtained from prior case studies of science programs performed by Georgia Tech; (3) experience in designing and conducting "user surveys" of scientific programs; and (4) experience in coding curriculum vita and analyzing data to measure the career trajectories of researchers and research fellows, employing "event history analysis" as the principal statistical tool.
