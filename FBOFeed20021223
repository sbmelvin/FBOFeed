<RESPDATE>040103
<ARCHDATE>05012003
<CONTACT>Viola Underdue-Mitchell, 202 267-7529
<DESC>The Broad Information Technology Services contract (BITS) is being replaced with The Broad Information Technology and Services Contract II.  BITS II is a follow-on contract to BITS I.  BITS II will be designed to be a contract vehicle that will allow the contractor/team, when selected for a specific task, to meet the IT and telecommunications support service requirements of the FAA.  BITS II will be a multiple award, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract.   <P> The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is hereby attaching a draft statement of work for the anticipated work to be performed under BITS II.  This draft statement of work should not be considered the actual Screening Information Request (SIR).  Although there may be some changes to this statement of work, the government does not anticipate making changes to the overall scope of this statement of work.  <P> The BITS II requirement is being set aside exclusively for Small and Small and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDBs).  It is anticipated that the percentage of awards made to SEDBs will be higher than the number of awards made to small businesses.  Regarding the NAIC codes chosen for BITS:  <P> (a.)	NAIC codes 517110, 541511, 541512, 541513 and 541519 will be used for the BITS II requirement. <P> (b.)	Offerors will be required to submit proposals that address each and every one of the types of services described in the statement of work, (i.e. they must bid on all of the identified NAIC codes).  Pursuant to SBA guidelines, if a procurement calls for two or more items or services with different size standards and the offeror must bid on all end items/services, it may qualify as a small business if it meets the commons size standard for those items accounting for the greatest percentage of total contract value.  For BITS II, the greatest percentage of total contract value is represented by theses NAIC codes:  541512, 541513, and 541519 that have identical size standards. <P> (c.)	The predominant size standard for BITS II is NAIC Codes 541512, 541513, and 54519, which indicate that a business may not earn in excess of $21 million in revenues for the year in order to qualify as a small business or SEDB. <P> (d.)	517110 cannot be used as the predominant NAIC code under the BITS II, but can be used at        the subcontract level within SBA's guidelines. <P> The government reserves the right to identify additional NAIC codes prior to the release of the final SIR. <P> In order to qualify for consideration as a prime contractor under BITS II, the offeror must have business income resultant from performance of IT and/or telecommunications support services totaling thirty six million dollars $36,000,000 over the past 3 years and no less than $10,000,000 million in any one of the past three years.   The anticipated release date of the SIR has been changed to January 28, 2003. <P> The anticipated award date of the BITS II contract has been changed to June 2003. <P> If potential offerors have any questions regarding the draft statement of work or other related issues, the questions must be submitted to the BITS II Contracting Officer, Viola Underdue-Mitchell in writing via e:mail at  http://www.viola.mitchell@faa.gov on or before January 13, 2003.   <P> Attached is a compiled list of vendors expressing interest in BITS II in response to the announcement posted June 18th.  The sole purpose of the vendors list is to provide contractors interested in BITS II with the names and addresses of potential team members.  This Vendors List will not be used as a mail list by the government.  Potential offerors are responsible for obtaining the SIR from the FAA's Contract Opportunities Homepage.  The FAA will not add anymore vendor names to the BITS II Vendors List. <P>

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a sole-source Request for Quotation (RFQ) for four (4) hand-held TRACeR III-V X-Ray Flourescent Instruments. This procurement is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures (FAR Subpart 13.5). NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from KeyMaster Technologies, 415 N. Quay St., Ste. 1, Kennewick, Washington, pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and FAR 13.501(a) (Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996) for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the Agency's requirements.   KeyMaster will build four Phase III prototype hand-held X-ray Flourescent instruments by modifying phase II instruments with a vacuum enhancement capability for use as a material analysis device called TRACeR III-V.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1. KeyMaster is a NASA partner under Space Act Agreement 8-02020 for construction of the Phase III prototype hand held device using parts supplied by NASA.	KeyMaster has agreed via the Space Act Agreement to supply the skilled labor and facilities (cost sharing arrangement) to develop the TRACeRTM III-V hand held device. 2. KeyMaster is uniquely qualified to supply these services for the assembly of the hand held device.  KeyMaster delivered the Phase II device in accordance with the in the Space Act Agreement.  KeyMaster will incorporate a NASA technology called the Vacuum Enhanced Capability (VEC) into the Phase II unit to make the Phase III unit.  KeyMaster's previous experience with the Phase I and II units make them uniquely qualified to build the interfaces required for the VEC to work in conjunction with the Phase II unit.	3. The TRACeR TM III-V technology uses a NASA/MSFC and KeyMaster joint patent pending that enables the analysis of elements on the periodic table with atomic numbers 9-17 for part identification, failure analysis, and contamination (silicon) detection during surface preparation procedures for welding and the application of protective coatings. KeyMaster holds the exclusive rights for manufacturing portions of the needed TRACeR TM III-V.   4. This Phase III TRACeRTM III-V supports the NASA Direct Part Marking Standard 6002A and Handbook 6003A, approved in November 2002, found at	     http://standards.nasa.gov     .  These documents require all NASA parts to be marked with machine-readable matrix symbols.   Therefore, upgraded marking technologies are critical to deal with parts that are painted or covered with foam.  The X-ray fluorescent method has demonstrated the unique capability to detect identification symbols marked with certain materials through 1.5  inches of External Tank insulating foam and six layers of Reusable Solid Rocket Motor rubber insulation.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on January 6, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation Number is:  667-25-03 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  Award will be made using part 13.5 test program for commercial items and the simplified acquisition procedures.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2001-10.  This acquisition is a 100% Set-aside for Small Business.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 421420 and the size standard is 100 employees.  It was originally suspected that the equipment needed is currently under contract, but RFQ 9542 that was issued on November 12, 2002, through GSA Advantage, received 0 (Zero) responses.  Statement of Work:  The Overton Brooks Veteran Affairs Medical Center, located at 510 East Stoner Avenue, Shreveport, LA 71101, needs a vendor to furnish all necessary equipment, software/hardware, licenses, labor, tools, transportation/shipping, and personnel needed to install a new dictation/transcription system that is needed to digitally store the dictations of medical health care providers who dictate progress notes, discharge summaries, operation reports, nuclear medicine reports, radiology reports and history/physical exams for inpatients and outpatients.  The digitally stored information will then be retrieved by our Medical Center transcription staff and vendor(s) who provide supplemental support for transcription of this stored data.  Vendor must provide interface with existing and/or be compatible with all Department of Veterans Affairs systems and software.  The equipment will need to have the capability of being upgraded in order to accommodate a higher traffic volume that may materialize in future years.  The present system in place is not able to accommodate the increasing number of individuals that need to use the unit efficiently, without additional cost.

<DESC>Request for Quotations
"Federal Budgetary Policy and Processes" Seminar

The U.S. Office of Personnel Management is soliciting price quotations to perform the services described in this request for quotations (RFQ).  This procurement is set aside for competition among small businesses only.  The North America Industrial Classification Code (NAIC) is 611430 with a size threshold of 100 or fewer employees for determining if a company is considered small business for purposes of this acquisition. 

The work will consist of three segments - (1), assisting in the design and staffing of a week long seminar overview of the Federal budget process, (2), the creation of a four-day case simulation that models the federal budget process explained in the first week, and (3), the delivery of the simulation at the Western Management Development Center (WMDC) in Aurora, Colorado (a suburb of Denver).

This work will support the delivery of the Federal Budgetary Policies and Processes seminar at the WMDC from April 21- May 2, 2003.  The WMDC plans to conduct the seminar and simulation in 2004 and 2005 as well. We expect each seminar will be attended by up to 90 Federal managers from both domestic and Department of Defense (DOD) departments and agencies.  

Any proposal must cover all three programs.  Partial proposals will not be accepted.

After all proposals have been submitted, the responsible WMDC Associate Director and WMDC Contracting Officer will review the proposals and award a contract for the simulation based primarily on the WMDC's experience of running simulations in various policy seminars.  This experience will be used to assess the ability of the simulation to meet the primary learning objective of teaching the implementation of budget policy and the role of the mid-level Federal manager in that process.  The secondary, though important, basis of the award will be the price, though price is not the sole determinate.  The dollar amount of this award will be less than $100,000.

Your proposal must be received at the address listed below by close of business , 5:00 pm MST on January 6, 2003.  Any proposals received after this time and date may be considered only if the Government determines it is in its best interest to do so.

	Western Management Development Center
	ATTN:  Ms. Jean Speed
	3151 South Vaughn Way, Suite 300
	Aurora, CO  80014


DESIGN AND STAFFING

This part of the requirement will involve working closely with the WMDC Associate Director and Program Manager of the seminar to design and staff a one week overview of the Federal budget process which provides both an analysis of the political, macroeconomic and policy forces affecting the Federal budget and an in-depth explanation of how to successfully prepare and defend a budget submission.

SIMULATION 

The primary learning objective of the simulation is to create an experiential exercise where the participants will learn and successfully practice the knowledge and skills they will need to produce a successful budget submission for their organization.

In the past, successful simulations have taken the following approach:

1. Describe a simulated organization for which budgets (domestic agency and DOD) need to be prepared, and the scenario in which the domestic agency and DOD agency budgets are being formulated for the simulated organization. 

2.  Describe the players in the simulation and their roles in the budget process as they relate to the budgets to be simulated.  These roles usually include:

a. Budget Officers for the agency (or bureau, branch, unit - whatever level is appropriate for the budget to be simulated in both the domestic and DOD organizations). 

 
b. Program Officials for the agency (or bureau, etc.).

c. Departmental Budget Director or Comptroller (for DOD agency).

d. OMB policy analysts 

e. Constituency group leaders (if appropriate to the simulation).

f. Congressional members/staff from the appropriate appropriations subcommittees.

The relationship of these roles has been built into the simulation and described along with their relationships and interactions with other major players in the budget process, i.e., Department Secretaries, OMB Director, President, Speaker of the House, etc., who play a role in the simulation as described under "DELIVERY."

3. Engage in a step-by-step walk through of the budget process as it directly relates to the organization simulated to include, in chronological order of occurrence, the following stages of (1) the formulation of the President's budget including output and outcome measures required by the GPRA and (2) the congressional budget process. The usual stages are:  
  
a.	OMB policy guidance including OMB circulars
b.	Agency internal budget process
c.	Agency and Departmental budget formulation
d.	Submission of budget to OMB
e.	OMB budget review
f.	OMB budget hearings with agency
g.	OMB passback
h.	Agency appeals	
i.	OMB preparation of President's budget 
j.	Submission of budget to Congress
k.	Appropriations subcommittee hearings
l.	Subcommittee markups
m.	Full committee hearings and/or
n.	Full floor debate of the bills

The case materials normally include a schedule for the dates and times these steps will be played out during the course of the simulation. Obviously, any simulation cannot be fully realistic because of time and capacity constraints.  For example, in reality small pieces of appropriations bills would not go to the floor of the House, but in the simulation they may for the sake of demonstrating the process.

Other ways of approaching the simulation that will clearly achieve the main learning objective of the four-day experiential exercise are welcome and will be considered.

A summary or outline of the simulation materials must be submitted for review to the WMDC no later than February 28, 2003, while all final case simulation documents and materials must be submitted to the WMDC no later then March 14, 2003.  Historically, the case simulation materials (i.e., descriptions of the players, schedule of Executive and Congressional Branch actions, description of the case, Executive Branch simulated budget preparation instructions, and Congressional Branch simulation instructions) required about 60 pages of text.
 
 
DELIVERY

The proposal must also include preparation for and the actual delivery of the simulation on the dates specified.  The preparation consists of timely submission, i.e., 3 weeks in advance of first day of seminar, of a camera ready copy of all documents and materials needed for the simulation and the identification of other experienced individuals who would be willing to help guide the seminar participants through the simulation. In this context, experience is defined as at least 3-5 years dealing with budget issues of the type faced by the role being portrayed/advised by the resource person.  These individuals will play the roles of Departmental Secretaries, Director of OMB, President of the United States, Speaker of the House, and Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Staff Director of the Appropriations Subcommittee, and, if appropriate, the Chair of the constituency group.  Because these resource persons are absolutely necessary to the simulation, submission of names of individuals who are available and willing to take part in the simulation is a vital component of the delivery of the FBPP seminar. Because clearances may be needed for some resource people, they should be identified as far ahead of the seminar dates as possible. In addition, resource people must be able to motivate and make substantive presentations to the seminar participants they are advising regarding the issues and perspectives needed by the staff persons the seminar participants are role playing. The WMDC Program Manager in charge of the FBPP seminar will approve/disapprove all potential resource person nominations based on the above criteria. 

The WMDC will prepare separate purchase orders to provide honoraria for the resource persons identified by the contractor, with the understanding that no honorarium may exceed $2,500, the WMDC's standard rate of compensation.  The names of all resource persons and identification of those specific individuals who should receive an honoraria will be provided to the WMDC Program Manager at least 1 month in advance of the first day of the seminar.  If government employees are identified, honoraria will not be paid. Travel, lodging, and meals will be provided by the WMDC for all resource personnel during the simulation. The WMDC will also provide (either in kind or at standard government rates) travel, lodging and meals for contractor personnel engaged in any on-site simulation activities during the course of the seminar.

The contractor will also provide biographical statements for all speakers and resource persons participating in the FBPP 3 weeks in advance of the first day of the seminar.  This information will be provided to participants in their seminar materials.

The actual delivery of the simulation consists of briefing the participants on the particulars of the simulation, answering questions throughout the simulation, assisting the participants as their roles require, and coordinating the ongoing simulation with the resource faculty.  All individuals conducting the simulation should be prepared to be fully involved in the simulation from 8:30 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. during its presentation. The WMDC Program Manager in charge of the FBPP program will be the final authority for making decisions regarding any activities during the seminar or simulation.
 
EVALUATION CRITERIA

The following criteria will be used by the WMDC to review, evaluate, and select the subject contractor:

Technical/Management Evaluation Criteria

The successful bidder shall demonstrate their expertise in design and delivery of an intensive two week residential seminar that is focused on providing participants with a meaningful experience and simulation which transfers knowledge to participants about the entire Federal budget process and associated policies.  The evaluation will be based on the ability of the bidder to sufficiently outline the entire participant learning experience so extent of knowledge transfer can be determined.   The Kirkpatrick Four Level training evaluation model will be used as a reference for this evaluation.

Evidence of specific experience in design and delivery of similar seminars to Federal government audiences must be provided.  Materials such as participant evaluations, client evaluations or client referrals of these similar seminars shall be provided to demonstrate level of success.  The successful bidder will be evaluated on their ability to meet or exceed customer requirements and obtain high ratings from seminar participants.

The sample simulation materials will be evaluated for appropriateness and significance in transferring the knowledge to all participants.  Again, the Kirkpatrick Four Level training evaluation model will be used as a reference for this evaluation.  The simulation will also be evaluated for its relevance to current Federal government policies.

Submission of Quotations

Each company should submit a proposal that consists of two parts:  a technical proposal and price quotation.

The technical proposal should contain the following:

1)	a proposed agenda for the seminar;
2)	a list of proposed presenters and their respective topic(s) for the seminar;
3)	a detailed description of the simulation and the process used to present it;
4)	actual case materials to be used in the simulation;
5)	materials demonstrating experience with similar seminars in the Federal government;
6)	past seminar participant and/or client evaluations;
7)	client contact information

The price quotation should contain a breakdown of expenses associated with all required services, including, but not limited to:  presenter and staff honoraria, seminar and simulation materials, and estimates of  any other associated seminar costs.

Evaluation of Quotations

The WMDC will award a purchase order to the company that offers the best value to the Government considering primarily their technical excellence and, secondarily, their total proposed price for performing the services described in the RFQ.  For this procurement, technical excellence is significantly more important than price to the Government in making its award decision.

Technical Proposal Evaluation

The following criteria will be used by the WMDC to review and evaluate technical proposals.  They are listed in descending order of importance:


Criteria
1)  Demonstrated ability to design and deliver a successful 2 week seminar on Federal budget policies and processes, including securing the services of all presenters and support personnel.
2)  Demonstrated ability to design and deliver a successful experiential simulation of the Federal budget process in the context of a Federal budget policies and processes seminar.
3)  Cost
4)  Thoroughness and overall appropriateness of all documents and related case materials for the Federal budget process simulation.
5)  Experience performing the same or similar work for the U.S. Office of Personnel Management's Office of Executive and Management Development, other Federal agencies, or the private sector.

<DESC>17.	The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) plans to establish a Coast Guard Information Technology Services Solutions (CGITSS) Multiple Award Contract (MAC).  CGITSS will provide for the full range of IT service solutions for the U.S. Coast Guard, with the potential for use by organizations performing Homeland Security functions within the same department as the Coast Guard, through four primary support services functional areas:  Information Management Analysis and Planning (MAP), Information Systems Engineering (ISE) and Design, Information Systems Operations and Management (SOM), and Information Systems Security (ISS).  The attached draft requirements document contains additional information on these functional areas and the anticipated labor categories.  CGITSS will provide contracting opportunities for full and open competition, as well as set-asides for small business, 8(a), and HUBzone in all functional areas. The anticipated NAICS codes are 541511, 541512, 541513, and 541519.  The Small Business size standard is $21.0M.  CGITSS contracts will be awarded to vendors in all functional areas for which they are determined to provide the best value to the government taking technical capability, management approach, past performance and pricing into consideration.  Therefore, a vendor may receive a CGITSS contract that includes all four functional areas, three functional areas, two functional areas, or just one functional area.  CGITSS contracts will promote the use of performance based contracting, however, contracts will also accommodate the issuance of task orders for all types of pricing arrangements (firm-fixed price, time & material, cost-plus fixed fee, labor hours).  CGITSS contracts will allow for various incentive contracting features, including award fee and award term.  This means that the opportunity will exist for CGITSS contracts/task orders to go beyond the normal 5-year performance period, with possible maximum performance periods of up to 15 years.  In addition, CGITSS will require pre-approval of prime contractors teaming partners/subcontractors.  Interested vendors are invited to attend one of two planned Industry Days to be held from 9:00 A.M. till 11:00 A.M. on December 16, 2002 and from 1:30 P.M till 3:30 P.M. on December 17, 2002 at the Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20590.  The purpose of the Industry Day sessions is to kick-off the CGITSS MAC project, review the functional areas and labor categories with industry, provide additional information regarding CGITSS, provide a forum for industry to pose questions regarding the project, and obtain from industry lessons learned from their involvement with other MAC and Government Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs).  If you cannot attend an Industry Day session, you will NOT be precluded from competing for CGITSS contracts, and, you WILL be able to pose questions regarding CGITSS to the contacts identified herein even after Industry Day.   Vendors interested in attending one of the Industry Day sessions must make an advance reservation in response to this announcement.  Due to limited seating, vendors are limited to sending one representative to one Industry Day session.  Reservations must be made by e-mail to Brenda Peterson, bpeterson@comdt.uscg.mil and Dani Wildason, dwildason@comdt.uscg.mil no later than 3:00 P.M. EST on December 6, 2002.  Telephone reservations and inquiries will not be accepted.  The subject line of the e-mail should read CGITSS and the e-mail should contain only the following information:  the name of the person requesting attendance at Industry Day, full corporate name and mailing address, attendees telephone number, attendees fax number, attendees e-mail address, and preference of Industry Day dates.  These e-mail responses shall NOT contain any attachments, corporate capabilities or other corporate marketing information.  Seating at Industry Day is on a first come, first serve basis.

<DESC>Notice of Contract Action (NOCA). A Sources Sought Synopsis was released on 19 November 2002, with no amendments, under the project title Air Force Nuclear Weapons and Counterproliferation Agency (NWCA), Kirtland AFB NM. This announcement is to notify all interested parties that Det 8 Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at Kirtland AFB, NM is seeking to award a small business set-aside contract for the upcoming NWCA effort and anticipates releasing a solicitation F29601-03-R-0001 on or about 9 January 2003 entitled Air Force Nuclear Weapons and Counterproliferation Agency (NWCA) Support. NWCA has primary technical and programmatic Air Force responsibility for Department of Defense (DoD) and National Nuclear Security Agency-Department of Energy (NNSA-DOE) nuclear weapon and counterproliferation activities. Activities include: (1) weapon effectiveness analysis, systems design and evaluations, and operational studies for counterforce strikes against chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives (CBRNE) and other asymmetric threats; (2) CBRNE target and intelligence assessments; (3) nuclear weapon modifications assessments, life extension assessments, system and component analysis, and management from operational deployment through retirement; (4) technical and programmatic oversight, technical interchange participation and documentation including summary reports of Nuclear Weapons Project Officers Groups (POGs). Nuclear weapon and counterproliferation solution concepts are developed and fielded through the USAF, DoD, and DOE acquisition processes to meet user requirements and ensure continued mission readiness, operation, and reliability certification throughout their lifetime.  Interaction between the USAF, DoD, and DOE agencies occurs through integrated product teams led by AF NWCA. To support this objective, NWCA is interested in augmenting their technical and engineering expertise in the following major areas, to be performed at the contractors facility and on-site at NWCA, Kirtland AFB, NM: (A) program management, (B) engineering, (C) scientific, (D) computational, (E) analysis, (F) testing, (G) technical reporting/documentation, (H) targeting/intelligence, (I) office administration and (J) network administration.  The primary objective of the overall effort is the integration of all these areas to support NWCA programs such as nuclear stockpile sustainment and life extension; agent defeat weapons concept development; and targeting and collateral effects tools development and application. Due to possible office space constraints at NWCA, the effort may have to be performed off-base at the contractors facility. Therefore, the contractor facility must be located within a 50-mile radius of NWCA, Kirtland AFB, NM. A draft RFP will not be issued for the acquisition; however, RFP attachments will be made available for viewing at the FedBizOpps website http://www.fedbizopps.gov prior to release of the RFP.  Offerors responding to this announcement are encouraged to monitor closely the website for potential changes to the acquisition. Offerors are also encouraged to register under the FedBizOpps Interested Vendors List (IVL). The list will allow vendors to register their interest in the solicitation and will be monitored and accessed by AFRL/PKVE personnel. Amendments and questions and answers concerning the announcement will be posted exclusively at the FedBizOpps website. All posted information will clearly display its date of posting. Offerors are reminded of the requirement to acknowledge all amendments (if any) in their proposal. This acquisition will be solicited as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside. Small business offerors submitting proposals should indicate whether they are a small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned small business or an HBCU/MI. Any resulting efforts will fall under NAICS Code 541710, with a size standard of 1,000 employees. A cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) completion type contract is contemplated. It is anticipated that the contractual effort will consist of one (1) award and will be a two (2) year basic effort with three (3) one-year priced option periods. The anticipated funds available for this effort are not anticipated to exceed $16.2M. Proposals will be due thirty days after the RFP release date. An organizational conflict of interest clause is anticipated in any resultant contract. Reference AFMC FAR Clause 5352.209-9002, Organizational Conflict of Interest (Jul 1997). The security classification of the contract is anticipated to be TOP SECRET/SCI. Foreign-owned firms are advised to contact the contracting officer or program manager before submitting a proposal to determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award. Only offerors certified by the Defense Logistics Information Services (DLIS) may submit offers. Contact US/Canada Joint Certification Office, DLIS, Federal Center, 74 Washington Avenue, North, Battle Creek MI 49017-3084, (1-888) 352-9333, http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/, for further information on certification and the approval process. Offerors are required to either submit a copy of the DLIS approved DD Form 2345 with their proposal or to the Contracting Officer, if access to unclassified, limited distribution data is required to prepare the proposal. All offerors must be registered in the Central Contracting Registration (CCR) to be eligible to receive a contract award.

<DESC>UNITED STATES TREASURY DEPARTMENT
GOVERNMENT DEBT ISSUANCE AND MANAGEMENT ADVISORS 
EMERGING MARKETS, WORLDWIDE.   

The U.S. Treasury Department provides technical assistance and policy advice to senior government and central bank officials and market participants in nearly 30 countries. We are recruiting candidates for positions as resident (long-term) and intermittent (short term) advisors in government debt issuance and management in countries throughout the world, including Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, Southeast and Central Asia, Latin America, South America, Africa, and the Middle East. This recruitment is for global assignments and significant international travel is required.

For resident (long-term) assignments, we seek experts in domestic government securities issuance and management. Experience in international bond markets is highly desirable. Applicants for resident assignments ideally should have a combination of public and private sector experience in government debt management, investment banking or financial advisory work. For intermittent (short term) assignments, we are seeking advisors with particular expertise in: liability management policy and procedures; legal framework for government securities; market regulation; custody, clearing and settlement; fixed income trading; treasury operations; and mortgage and other asset-backed finance. For all positions, management experience is desired. Prior overseas work experience in challenging environments is a distinct advantage. Foreign language skills are highly desirable. While technical skills are essential, the ability to gain the confidence of host government officials and provide sound but realistic advice to a sovereign government in an emerging market environment will determine ultimate success.   Candidates must be U.S. citizens or U.S. resident aliens.

SALARY AND BENEFITS: Salaries are negotiated in accordance with program regulations, based on demonstrated salary history and the skills required. The salary range is from $85,000 to $130,000, subject to January 1, 2003, cost of living adjustments (COLA).  Overseas benefits are provided as allowed by federal regulations.  Successful applications will be subject to a background investigation at the appropriate level.   This announcement is open and continuous until June 30, 2003.  Applicants should submit a cover letter, resume or OF-612 by e-mail to: tgray@ota.treas.gov or by mail to:  U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Technical Assistance, ATTN: Recruitment Coordinator, 740 15th Street, N. W., 4th Floor, Washington, D.C. 20220.  Please reference Solicitation Number IET-2003-0006 on your cover letter, resume or OF-612.  Only applicants to be interviewed will be contacted.  NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.      If you wish to be considered for this announcement and all future announcements for the Government Debt Issuance and Management Program, you must state so in the cover letter to your application. For application materials, visit our web site at: www.ustreasury.hu/other/empforms.shtml and www2.eps.gov/spg/TREAS/DODPSD/PSD/postdate_1.html  (search by solicitation number IET-2003-0006).

<SOLNBR>M0068102X0001

<ARCHDATE>02262003
<CONTACT>Susan Currey (760) 725-8136 Susan E. Currey, Contracting Officer, (760) 725-8136.
<DESC>The Regional Contracting Office Southwest (RCO-SW), Camp Pendleton, CA 92051-1609 is seeking information on Emission Reduction Credits (ERCs) within the San Diego Air Pollution Control District (SDAPCD) in exchange for Reclaim Trading Credits (RTCs) issued by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD). Specifically, the Marine Corps is interested in exchanging the RTCs for the greatest amount of stationary Class A NOx ERCs that could be made available from the SDAPCD. This Request for Information (RFI) is the initial stage of Market Research under Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and is not a Request for Proposals (RFPs) to buy, sell, or exchange any ERCs or RTCs. The Marine Corps is considering the authority of 41 C. F. R. 101-46.300 to conduct an exchange and is interested in receiving comments and recommendations, whether positive or critical, from potentially interested sources on such a transaction. The Marine Corps will use this information to assist in planning a solicitation for such an exchange. Comments will have no bearing on any subsequent evaluation of proposals and are not a prerequisite to participating in any future solicitation for the exchange of ERCs. The use of any comments in completing a RFP will be at the discretion of the Marine Corps. Submission of comments in response to this RFI is strictly voluntary. The Government does not intend to pay for any information furnished pursuant to this RFI. Proprietary information is not solicited; but if submitted, it should be marked as such. Accordingly, the Government is seeking information or comments in response to the following questions and concerns: 1. What is a reasonable time to allow offeror's to prepare a proposal to exchange ERCs for RTCs? 2. What  is a reasonable time to consummate an exchange of credits once we have accepted an offer? 3. Do you anticipate that you could procure reasonable quantities of NOx ERCs from existing ERC holders within SDAPCD to exchange for the credits to be disposed of in the SCAQMD? 4. If there are no existing credits that can be procured in the SDAPCD, could offerors reasonably facilitate credit-generating projects and then exchange such ERCs for the RTCs identified in Attachment 1? 5. If there are no ERCs available from existing holders that could be exchanged for RTCs, what would be a reasonable outside timeframe for generating such credits within the SDAPCD? 6. If the Marine Corps were to permit the disposal of its RTCs prior to the tender of exchange credits, what kind of security could be provided to the Marine Corps such as a performance bond, or irrevocable letter of credit? 7. Are p rices of SCAQMD RTCs sufficiently stable to enable offerors to predict the quantity of SDAPCD ERCs that could be provided in exchange without undue risk to the offeror? 8. Would you anticipate that the Government could procure more SDAPCD ERCs if it exchanged its SCAQMD RTCs on an "all or none" basis, or permitted offers to be based upon an exchange of partial quantities of credits?  If the latter, what would be a reasonable minimum increment, e.g. all credits in a year? 9. Do you anticipate any administrative difficulties in having the SDAPCD transfer ERC's from existing owners to the U.S. Marine Corps? If so, what might these difficulties be and are there any aspects of the contract that would make such transfer easier or more difficult? 10. The Marine Corps intends to award a contract to exchange credits on a "best value" basis and would intend to evaluate an offeror's past  performance and ability to obtain credits to be provided to the Marine Corps in addition to the quantity of credits to be provided. Do you anticipate that there are offerors who would have significant experience in exchanging credits, and if not, what kind of transactions do you believe might be relevant? With regard to the ability to obtain credits, do you anticipate that offerors could structure firm arrangements to generate credits that could be described in a proposal to the Marine Corps? 11. Are there standard industry contracts or provisions for the exchange of credits? 12. Are there any industry publications or other media that would be appropriate for advertising the Marine Corps' interest in exchanging RTCs for ERCs? Please provide written responses by close of business 27 January 2003 to the following address:  United States Marine Corps, Regional Contracting Office S outhwest, ATTN:  Susan E. Currey, Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, P.O. Box 1609, Oceanside, CA 92051-1609.  Point of Contact (POC) for this RFI is Susan E. Currey, Contracting Officer.  E-mail: curreyse@pendleton.usmc.mil.

Request for Price Quotes: Hourly Rate plus Expenses	 	STATEMENT OF WORK 	On-Site Utility Capacity Development 	for 	Tribal Public Water Systems 	in 	North and South Dakota Purpose 	The purpose of this contract is to develop the necessary technical, managerial,  and financial capacity of tribal public water system (PWS) utility organizations located in North and South Dakota through assessment, training, and technical assistance services.  Background 	The Safe Drinking Water Act (Section 1452(a) and (i) and Section 1420) encourages PWS regulatory  agencies to ensure that all new community or non-transient, non-community water systems commencing operation after October 1, 1999 demonstrate technical, managerial, and financial capacity with respect to the national primary drinking water regulations.  The tribal PWS regulatory program is  implemented by the U. S. EPA Region VIII office in Denver, CO.  To help accomplish this goal in Indian Country in EPA Region 8, all drinking water construction projects funded by the EPA Tribal Set-Aside (TSA) program will be included in a capacity assessment or review of assessment, and if needed,  capacity development followup.    	Some PWSs in Indian Country, whether owned by tribal entities or not, are not regulated by EPA, but by the appropriate state agency.  There are some general rules for jurisdiction, some specific exceptions, and much more to be determined in the future legally.   For the purposes of this Contract, capacity work will be done on all TSA projects, unless otherwise instructed by the Work Assignment Manager. 	Some TSA projects which need capacity work have been underway or completed for several years.  Other TSA projects are in all stages of development and  construction.  Still others are yet to be funded and started.  Generally, the goal of this Contract will be completion of capacity work before completion of construction.   	Review of existing capacity assessments and previous work will be done by EPA Region 8.  Recommendations for additional  work in these cases will be give to the Contractor by the Work Assignment Manager.  Capacity Assessments will be done according to EPA Region 8 tools, including primarily the Region 8 Tribal Capacity Assessment and Planning Worksheets for Public Water Systems, a copy of which may be obtained from  EPA Region 8.  Other capacity followup work will be tailored to each case according to specific direction of the Work Assignment Manager using various tools, many of which may be provided by EPA Region 8.   	The review, assessment, or followup process will usually be initiated by the Work  Assignment Manager.  In some cases the Contractor may be contacted directly by the PWS owner or operator.  In theses cases, the Contractor is expected to inform, and obtain direction from, the Work Assignment Manager before proceeding. 	In Indian Country, the Indian Health Service (IHS) is usually  involved in construction projects.  The Contractor is expected to coordinate capacity development efforts with the appropriate IHS personnel.  Sometimes other funding agencies may be involved.  The Contractor is expected to coordinate with any agencies involved in the construction or operation of  the facilities.  Responsibilities 	The Contractor will receive written (FAXed or e-mailed) assignments from the Contract's Work Assignment Manager for the one or both of the following two tasks: (1)	Capacity Assessment of PWS utility organizations in North and South Dakota Indian Country. 	At  the start of the contract, the Work Assignment Manager will send the Contractor a list of sites or utility organizations that are expected to need utility assessment during the next year.  Contacts, a brief summary of each site, and estimated date will be included.  The Work Assignment Manager will  provide more information as it is received, and will notify the Contractor when assessment services are required.  Generally, at least two weeks advance notice will be given to the Contractor for scheduling purposes.  The Contractor shall then schedule the assessment with the PWS owner or utility  manager.  One month will be allowed for assessment and reporting to EPA by the Contractor, after starting the assessment. 	Occasionally, the Contractor may be contacted directly by PWS owners, their engineers, or utility managers.  The Contractor shall then contact the Work Assignment Manager with  the case information and await further instruction on the case. 	The Contractor shall travel to the site, perform the assessment, communicate with the appropriate owner and agency representatives, and take photos if appropriate.   	The Contractor shall perform an assessment of the utility  organizations identified by the Work Assignment manager using the EPA Region 8 Tribal Capacity Assessment and Planning Worksheets for Public Water Systems.  This includes checklists and a spreadsheet to be completed by the Contractor on-site, working and coordinating with the appropriate  representatives. 	The Contractor shall prepare a written report for each assessment.  The reports must have the following features: 	They must include the completed Capacity Assessment and Planning Worksheets for Public Water Systems in WordPerfect and Lotus 123 formats. They must be addressed  to the Work Assignment Manager.  Email or FAX is the preferred transmission method. They must include a summary narrative including any comments concerning deficiencies, findings, recommendations, and conclusions, and a brief plan to address the deficiencies in capacity. (2)	Capacity development  followup to address deficiencies noted in the capacity assessment of PWS utility organizations in North and South Dakota Indian Country. 	At the start of the Contract, the Work Assignment Manager will send a list of probable sites needing capacity development followup during the next year.  This  will include approximate dates, contacts, and a brief scope of work for each site.  The Work Assignment Manager will send further instructions and specific dates when other on-site followup is needed at least two weeks prior to the required date. 	The Contractor will usually be instructed to  follow up at a site where a capacity assessment has been completed.  In these cases, the assessment and associated report or recommendations shall be used by the Contractor to complete the followup.  In some cases, an assessment may not be completed.

Request for Price Quotes: Hourly Rate plus Expenses	 	STATEMENT OF WORK 	On-Site Utility Capacity Development 	for 	Tribal Public Water Systems 	in 	Montana and Wyoming Purpose 	The purpose of this contract is to develop the necessary technical, managerial, and financial  capacity of tribal public water system (PWS) utility organizations located in Montana and Wyoming through assessment, training, and technical assistance services.  Background 	The Safe Drinking Water Act (Section 1452(a) and (i) and Section 1420) encourages PWS regulatory agencies to ensure that  all new community or non-transient, non-community water systems commencing operation after October 1, 1999 demonstrate technical, managerial, and financial capacity with respect to the national primary drinking water regulations.  The tribal PWS regulatory program is implemented by the U. S. EPA  Region VIII office in Denver, CO.  To help accomplish this goal in Indian Country in EPA Region 8, all drinking water construction projects funded by the EPA Tribal Set-Aside (TSA) program will be included in a capacity assessment or review of assessment, and if needed, capacity development  followup.    	Some PWSs in Indian Country, whether owned by tribal entities or not, are not regulated by EPA, but by the appropriate state agency.  There are some general rules for jurisdiction, some specific exceptions, and much more to be determined in the future legally.  For the purposes of  this Contract, capacity work will be done on all TSA projects, unless otherwise instructed by the Work Assignment Manager. 	Some TSA projects which need capacity work have been underway or completed for several years.  Other TSA projects are in all stages of development and construction.  Still  others are yet to be funded and started.  Generally, the goal of this Contract will be completion of capacity work before completion of construction.   	Review of existing capacity assessments and previous work will be done by EPA Region 8.  Recommendations for additional work in these cases  will be give to the Contractor by the Work Assignment Manager.  Capacity Assessments will be done according to EPA Region 8 tools, including primarily the Region 8 Tribal Capacity Assessment and Planning Worksheets for Public Water Systems, a copy of which may be obtained from EPA Region 8.  Other  capacity followup work will be tailored to each case according to specific direction of the Work Assignment Manager using various tools, many of which may be provided by EPA Region 8.   	The review, assessment, or followup process will usually be initiated by the Work Assignment Manager.  In some  cases the Contractor may be contacted directly by the PWS owner or operator.  In theses cases, the Contractor is expected to inform, and obtain direction from, the Work Assignment Manager before proceeding. 	In Indian Country, the Indian Health Service (IHS) is usually involved in construction  projects.  The Contractor is expected to coordinate capacity development efforts with the appropriate IHS personnel.  Sometimes other funding agencies may be involved.  The Contractor is expected to coordinate with any agencies involved in the construction or operation of the facilities.  Responsibilities 	The Contractor will receive written (FAXed or e-mailed) assignments from the Contract's Work Assignment Manager for the one or both of the following two tasks: (1)	Capacity Assessment of PWS utility organizations in Montana and Wyoming Indian Country. 	At the start of the  contract, the Work Assignment Manager will send the Contractor a list of sites or utility organizations that are expected to need utility assessment during the next year.  Contacts, a brief summary of each site, and estimated date will be included.  The Work Assignment Manager will provide more  information as it is received, and will notify the Contractor when assessment services are required.  Generally, at least two weeks advance notice will be given to the Contractor for scheduling purposes.  The Contractor shall then schedule the assessment with the PWS owner or utility manager.  One  month will be allowed for assessment and reporting to EPA by the Contractor, after starting the assessment. 	Occasionally, the Contractor may be contacted directly by PWS owners, their engineers, or utility managers.  The Contractor shall then contact the Work Assignment Manager with the case  information and await further instruction on the case. 	The Contractor shall travel to the site, perform the assessment, communicate with the appropriate owner and agency representatives, and take photos if appropriate.   	The Contractor shall perform an assessment of the utility organizations  identified by the Work Assignment manager using the EPA Region 8 Tribal Capacity Assessment and Planning Worksheets for Public Water Systems.  This includes checklists and a spreadsheet to be completed by the Contractor on-site, working and coordinating with the appropriate representatives. 	The  Contractor shall prepare a written report for each assessment.  The reports must have the following features: ?	They must include the completed Capacity Assessment and Planning Worksheets for Public Water Systems in WordPerfect and Lotus 123 formats. ?	They must be addressed to the Work  Assignment Manager.  Email or FAX is the preferred transmission method. ?	They must include a summary narrative including any comments concerning deficiencies, findings, recommendations, and conclusions, and a brief plan to address the deficiencies in capacity. (2)	Capacity development followup  to address deficiencies noted in the capacity assessment of PWS utility organizations in Montana and Wyoming Indian Country. 	At the start of the Contract, the Work Assignment Manager will send a list of probable sites needing capacity development followup during the next year.  This will include  approximate dates, contacts, and a brief scope of work for each site.  The Work Assignment Manager will send further instructions and specific dates when other on-site followup is needed at least two weeks prior to the required date. 	The Contractor will usually be instructed to follow up at a  site where a capacity assessment has been completed.  In these cases, the assessment and associated report or recommendations shall be used by the Contractor to complete the followup.  In some cases, an assessment may not be completed.  In these cases, specific instructions will be given to the  Contractor by the Work Assignment Manager.  In all cases the followup work will be within the scope of the "Getting Started" list on page 2-1 of the EPA Region 8 Capacity Assessment and Planning Worksheets for Public Water Systems. 	The Contractor shall travel to the site, perform the needed  capacity development activities, communicate with the appropriate tribal, utility organization, and other agency representatives, and take photos.  Several site visits to each site may be necessary, over a lengthy time period.  Close communication with the Work Assignment Manager is necessary to  prioritize work.

<DESC>The Department of State contemplates the award of a sole-source contract to Trans Digital Technologies for the purchase of consumables (foil, ribbon and coating), and the related technical services to support Toppan MP300 US passport printers currently in use at the 16 domestic passport agencies and centers over the next 5 years.  This procurement also includes the purchase of additional passport printers to support current and new passport facilities.  This is a follow-on to a competitive procurement for passport printers that was awarded to Trans Digital Technologies in April, 1998.  The Department of State?s capital investment in the MP300 printers is over $14,000,000.00.  These printers have proven to be highly reliable and have only been in use for approximately one quarter of their 10 year minimum life expectancy.  The following is an estimate of the current requirement: 125 additional printers; coating for 64,000,000 books; 8,400,000 ribbons/foil sets; and remedial maintenance; preventive maintenance; and spare parts for the new printers and the 425 currently in use at the passport facilities.

Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) plans to establish a Coast Guard Information Technology Services Solutions (CGITSS) Multiple Award Contract (MAC).  CGITSS will provide for the full range of IT service solutions for the U.S. Coast Guard, with the potential for use by organizations performing Homeland Security functions within the same department as the Coast Guard, through four primary support services functional areas:  Information Management Analysis and Planning (MAP), Information Systems Engineering (ISE) and Design, Information Systems Operations and Management (SOM), and Information Systems Security (ISS).  The attached draft requirements document contains additional information on these functional areas and the anticipated labor categories.  CGITSS will provide contracting opportunities for full and open competition, as well as set-asides for small business, 8(a), and HUBzone in all functional areas. The anticipated NAICS codes are 541511, 541512, 541513, and 541519.  The Small Business size standard is $21.0M.  CGITSS contracts will be awarded to vendors in all functional areas for which they are determined to provide the best value to the government taking technical capability, management approach, past performance and pricing into consideration.  Therefore, a vendor may receive a CGITSS contract that includes all four functional areas, three functional areas, two functional areas, or just one functional area.  CGITSS contracts will promote the use of performance based contracting, however, contracts will also accommodate the issuance of task orders for all types of pricing arrangements (firm-fixed price, time & material, cost-plus fixed fee, labor hours).  CGITSS contracts will allow for various incentive contracting features, including award fee and award term.  This means that the opportunity will exist for CGITSS contracts/task orders to go beyond the normal 5-year performance period, with possible maximum performance periods of up to 15 years.  In addition, CGITSS will require pre-approval of prime contractors teaming partners/subcontractors.

<DESC>This is a follow-on announcement to previous synopses that MARAD issued in the summer and fall of 2002, regarding an A-76 cost comparison study of MARAD's NDRF sites at Suisun Bay near Benicia, Calif., James River near Ft. Eustis, Va; and the Neches River, near Beaumont, Texas.   

The A-76 study will review the operations at the NDRF sites to determine the least costly and most efficient method of operation.  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76, "Performance of Commercial Activities", sets forth the general policy of the Government to achieve economy and enhance productivity.  The circular requires Federal agencies to review their commercial activities to determine whether it would be more economical to continue operating them in-house (i.e., with Government employees) or under contract with commercial sources.  The review will be conducted in accordance with Circular A-76 and the revised supplemental handbook.  

This synopsis serves to post a draft of the solicitation and the latest revised PWS.  The site for the fleet manual and other technical exhibits cited in the solicitation is:

DOCUMENT SECURITY
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information. SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only. In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation.

REASONABLE CARE:

        1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it. The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA. This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

        NOTE: It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users. Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information. The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination. Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary:  

(a) A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local
     jurisdiction to conduct business. The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address,    
     phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally 
     authorized to act for the company. The business must be of the type required to do the work. A 
     general contractor?s license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such 
     licenses. In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the 
     information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and

(b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business 
     license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by 
     calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

(c) A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

(d) A Valid picture state driver?s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU 
     documents.  Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the 
     individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the 
     documents. SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either 
     previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in 
     paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2.   Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

3.   Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract
and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

4. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall
provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor?s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

The announcement is further modified to change the date for Industry Day to 29 Jan 2003, extend industry response time to 15 Jan 03 and correct email addresses.  POC Ms. Michelle Kalphat, RDECOM STC, Fax (407) 384-5454. E-MAIL: Click here to send via e-mail questions regarding exact location and times of the OASIS Industry Day, Michelle_Kalphat@peostri.army.mil. The US Army PEO STRI, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826-3276 will initiate research in FY03 for ORGANIC AIR VEHICLE SENSOR INTEGRATED SUITE (OASIS) under BAA N61339-01-R-0023 issued in March 2001.  PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:  This is the official notification/announcement  for an Industry Day for the Organic Air Vehicle Sensor Integrated Suite (OASIS) Program to be held on behalf of Mr. Sam Wilson, DARPA/TTO Program Manager for the OASIS Program scheduled for Wednesday, 29 January 03, in Orlando, FL.  The goals of the OASIS program, as defined at the Collision Avoidance Workshop held 30 September 02-2 October 02, are to prototype a sensor suite system highlighting advanced technology for Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) and Organic Air Vehicles (OAVs); to assess  strengths and limitations of each sensor suite system based on actual field experiments under the following flight test conditions: under the canopy, MOUT, inside buildings, and inside caves and tunnels; and to develop and validate critical technology for understanding sensor suite system performance with coordinated use of small numbers of vehicles and degraded communications or sensors.  The OASIS Program is a 4 year DARPA program to develop a sensor suite system for the Organic Air Vehicle that will provide situation awareness, target location, collision avoidance and operations in complex terrain.  It is anticipated that the program will be conducted in 3 Phases.   Availability of funding beyond FY2003 will be predicated on the success of the technical research demonstrated during Phase I of the program effort. Great latitude in prototype architecture and testing methods for development are encouraged.   Field experiments for evaluation of strengths and weaknesses will focus development efforts and assist in understanding the tradeoffs in performance in conditions relevant to future missions for the vehicle.   PROGRAM SCOPE: Multiple awards are anticipated and may take the form of a contract, cooperative agreement, or technology investment agreement. Collaborative efforts/teaming is encouraged. Under technology investment agreements cost share must be 50/50 to the extent practicable. To the extent an offeror proposes 50/50 cost share or greater, the Government will consider waiving or reducing most patent and data rights. Contractors interested in presenting a poster session/display must request a display area within two weeks of the scheduled Industry Day, but no later than COB 15 January  2003 to Ms. Kalphat via email. WHITE PAPER/PROPOSALS SUBMISSION: Additional information regarding specific BAA information, questions regarding white paper/request for proposal submittals and evaluation criteria may be presented at the Industry Day. NON-GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL: Awardees under the OASIS Program may be required to exchange technical information with the participants selected in other solicitations. All proprietary material should be clearly marked and will be held in strict confidence. Restrictive notices, notwithstanding proposals, may be handled, for administrative purposes only, by SRS Technologies, Inc. of Arlington, VA, a DARPA support contractor which is bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. In addition, input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants and experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. These non-Government technical consultants will not have access to proposals that are labeled by the offerors as "GOVERNMENT ONLY." Only Government evaluators will make selections under the OASIS research effort.   ADMINISTRATION: All administrative correspondence and questions regarding this announcement should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail is preferred.  DARPA intends to use electronic mail for correspondence regarding this Industry Day, but offerors are cautioned not to use e-mail to transmit material of a proprietary nature.

The APKWS is a precision weapon that fills the capability gap between the current unguided 2.75 rocket and Hellfire anti-armor missile. APKWS is further defined as an umbrella program that initially includes the guided M151 2.75 inch rocket (Block 1) along  with a family of other precision rockets utilizing existing warheads (M151, M261, M264, M267, M255A1, M229, M257, M274, M278 and WTU-1/B) with and or without a guidance component. The Government has selected General Dynamics Armament and Technical Product s (GDATP) as the systems integrator for APKWS. The information submitted in response to this Request for Information (RFI) will be used to assist both the PM-ARM and GDATP in developing a comprehensive technology roadmap for APKWS block improvements in the  2006 to 2015 time period. The roadmap will serve as a guide for formulating a best value approach to plan future technology integration by balancing cost, performance, schedule and risk. Proprietary information should not be submitted and will not be acce pted.  The following technical areas are of interest:  enhanced system survivability, improved and multi-option warhead solutions, thermo baric warheads, improved maximum and minimum operating range, full CCM capability, multi-mode seekers and smart launchers. Th e focus of this RFI is to identify current industry initiatives in these areas. Information to be supplied should include product literature, pictures, item identification, intended mission or function, approximate unit cost, technical readiness level (TRL ), production status and any other data considered relevant to the purpose of this survey. A technical evaluation panel to assess technical feasibility and potential program application will review information received by the Government. It is desirable that the information be provided in a white paper (6 pages or less) and address the following items as they relate to the technology development areas, as appropriate: Experience and Capabilities (as related to APKWS/2.75 Inch Rocket System) 	Research areas (past & current)  	Development programs (past & current)  	Production programs (past & current)  	Customer experience (past & current work with Army or other DoD)  	Program experience (past and current) 	Workforce experience and capabilities (e.g., in design, analysis,         development, testing, manufacturing)  	Facilities available (e.g., design & analysis, manufacturing, test labs,         development labs)  	List of data available to support technical development efforts (weight,         envelope, performance, maintainability/supportability/reliability, cost,         etc.)  Potential APKWS Program Involvement 	Recommended participation in APKWS program  	Scope of Work and description of efforts required to achieve TRL 6 by                 September 2005  This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this  RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and the Government's use of such information.

DoD will  begin accepting proposals in response to this solicitation on March 3, 2003.  Five DoD components will participate in the STTR 2003 solicitation  the Departments of the Army, Navy and Air Force; the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and t he Missile Defense Agency (MDA).  The solicitation will list all the R&D topics under which DoD is seeking proposals, and will also contain detailed information on the parameters of the STTR Program and how to submit a proposal.  Small firms apply first fo r a one year phase I award to test the scientific, technical, and commercial feasibility of a particular concept.  Proposals are limited to 25 pages in length.  If phase I proves successful, the firm may be invited to apply for a two-year phase II award to  further develop the concept, usually to the prototype stage.  On January 2, 2003, DoD will also publicly release on the DoD SBIR Web Site http://www.acq.osd.mil/sadbu/sbir  the names of the STTR solicitation topic authors and their phone numbers.  This wi ll give small companies an opportunity to ask technical questions about specific solicitation topics by telephone before they submit a proposal.  Once DoD begins accepting proposals on March 3, 2003 such telephone questions will no longer be accepted.  Pha se I proposals are to be submitted to the addressees designated in the solicitation, and must arrive no later than 5:00 P.M. EST time on April 16, 2003.

2.  The Sustainment study should be based on the following factors:

	a.  Government reported outage and maintenance repair data derived from the US Air Force Reliability and maintainability Information System 	(REMIS) reports for the TPX-42A(V)10/11 for the last three years.  Analysis of the REMIS data should produce information to identify the  
	leading causes of TPX-42 failures.  This information should be formatted to reflect maintenance history data by system serial number and should
	include organization, equipment designator, serial number, capability impact, report number, downtime code, work unit code, maintenance action
start/stop date and time, maintenance hours and maintenance comments.  Analysis of the REMIS data should include identification of failure trends for system work unit codes.

b.  Analysis of the SSM SAT Tool database for TPX-42 systems.  Analysis should include identification of equipment item failure based on cost of system repair/replacement.  Failure trends for work unit coded items should be analyzed and reported to show ranking by Mission Capable (MICAP) failures and cost of repair.

c.  Engineering analysis of the one hundred failure rated items on a sub-assembly basis (i.e. USAF technical orders identify Major and minor assemblies and sub-assemblies, such as circuit cards, which can be cross referenced by the Work Unit Codes assigned to track their maintenance history.  Each of the top one hundred assemblies and sub-assemblies should be analyzed to determine the availability of memory units, etc.)  Rate the availability of the components to identify manufacturers, annual demand, projected demand reparability, warranty, and cost.

d.  Provide a report to identify the projected availability of parts to maintain the TPX-42A(V)10 for fifteen years.  Include data sources, data tables, analysis, and evaluation methods.  Rank the components evaluated to identify the least available to the most available projected to occur for the next fifteen years.

<DESC>This is a special notice issued by Westinghouse Savannah River Company (WSRC), management and operating contractor for the U.S. Department of Energy?s Savannah River Site near Aiken, South Carolina.  WSRC wishes to determine public interest in licensing for commercial sales a new software program that enables the easy and quick selection of applicable regulatory guidelines as a starting point for human factors engineering analyses.  The primary standard used by WSRC in the design of human-system interfaces for process control systems is NUREG 0700, ?Human-System Interface Design Review Guideline,? issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  NUREG 0700 includes over 1,650 distinct guidelines.  In developing the Human Factors Engineering Analysis Tool, a team of subject matter experts sorted all 1,650+ NUREG 0700 guidelines into categories (system technical applicability and system functional applicability) and types (general concept, supporting detail, and stand-alone).  The user categorizes the process control system, structure, or component to be analyzed, and the software selects a subset of the NUREG 0700 guidelines that are applicable.  The user then views each selected guideline on screen to analyze compliance of the process control system, structure, or component with the guideline.  Multiple users can access the program over a network to expedite guideline reviews, and users can record comments and/or attach electronic documents to support the user-designated compliance status.  Although designed to facilitate human factors engineering analyses in compliance with NUREG 0700, the data engine also could be applied to other data sets through a one-time data categorization effort for the new data set.  For more information on the Human Factors Engineering Analysis Tool, contact Dale K. Haas via telephone at (803) 725-4185; via fax at (803) 725-4988; via email at dale.haas@srs.gov; or via regular mail Westinghouse Savannah River Company, Building 773-41A, Room #238, Aiken, SC  29808.  Responses to this notice should be received by January 24, 2003.  This is not a request for a formal subcontract; it is a request for interested parties and licensing opportunities only.

<DESC>SENIOR DEMOCRACY AND GOVERNANCE ADVISOR

The position has been classified as GS-14 with a salary range of $74,697 to $91,265 plus overseas allowances.  The period of performance will be two years with possibility of annual extensions for a maximum of five years provided that there is a continuing need for the services, funds are available and satisfactory or better performance by the Contractor.  Only U.S. citizens are eligible for consideration.

I. 	POSITION TITLE OF DIRECT SUPERVISOR:

The Senior Democracy and Governance Advisor will be supervised by and report to the Director, Office of Social Development, USAID India. 

II.	SUPERVISORY CONTROLS: 

The Senior Democracy and Governance  (DG) Advisor will work under the general supervision and policy guidance of the USDH-FEOC Director of the Office of Social Development in New Delhi, India.  The  Director will review and approve the contractor?s work plan and performance measures. Supervision will be generally confined to weekly staff meetings and informal daily and/or weekly consultations. The Senior DG Advisor is expected to work independently with limited guidance, to take initiative, to supervise direct professional staff and to lead the justice team activities.

III.	POSITION DESCRIPTION:

1.	Introduction

The Mission?s current strategy (2003-2008) contains a new strategic objective ?Enhanced Opportunities for Vulnerable People? that includes an IR 5.3 ? New and Expanded Opportunities for Vulnerable Groups. More information on USAID/India?s strategy can be received from the website at www.usaid.gov/india. The new strategy is framed in the context of helping India, the world?s largest democracy, finish its agenda of sustaining development and reducing poverty.

Despite extensive constitutional and statutory safeguards, large sections of the Indian polity remain disadvantaged in their quest for equitable treatment under the civil and criminal judicial systems.  Human rights abuses are often generated by intense social tensions that disproportionately touch women, lower castes, the poor, religious minorities, and other disadvantaged groups.  For example, despite the strong women?s movement and revision of rape laws, most perpetrators of rape still go unpunished.  Bonded labor is also illegal, but it continues to persist. 

The Indian judiciary is independent, generally renders good decisions, and actively protects rights.  In the face of executive and legislative branch failure, NGOs increasingly and some successfully use the technique of public interest litigation to defend rights.  The judicial system, however, is hampered in its efforts to ensure rights and provide an adequate forum in which citizens can resolve their disputes with each other or with government. 

The challenges to better access to justice are numerous:

Police are stretched too thinly in many states and police abuse is widespread; 

Legal literacy is low and access to advice is insufficient; 
 
Justice system personnel are either not as aware of some aspects of the law as they need to be or hold attitudes that hinder the rights of some citizens. For example, to understand crimes such as violence against women, trafficking, and rape, and how the law might be used to combat them,  judges, advocates, state-funded legal aid providers and other justice system personnel need training and sensitization;

Reliable databases are lacking to aid prosecution;

An inability to provide protection while investigations are underway is prevalent; and 

Case backlogs are huge and processing times are so long (particularly at the lower court level) that justice is effectively denied. 

The poor suffer disproportionately in the legal system. Because they cannot post bail, many poor serve more time in jail waiting for their trial on petty charges than they would have served had they been found guilty.  In Delhi?s Tihar jail, for example, only 2,000 of the 11,000 inmates are convicted criminals; the remaining 9,000 are all awaiting processing.  

Frequently, the use of courts by marginalized groups is constrained by traditions that result in members of lower castes not challenging members of higher castes; or by legal illiteracy that assumes the lack of rights and options for redress.  Experimental "women?s courts? and "people?s courts,? often administered by retired judges, may provide an alternative to strengthen the access of the poor to justice, but it is unknown yet how well these mechanisms work and who uses them. Also, small businesses in both the formal and informal sectors also lack a mechanism for the settlement of business disputes.  

Over the next five years, USAID expects to focus attention on the justice needs of the bottom quintile of the population, assisting these people to gain: an understanding of their rights; access to stronger coalitions capable of advocating for the protection of their rights; and access to more responsive and effective mechanisms of delivering justice.  The focus will be primarily on a narrow band of social and economic rights that, when abused, constrain the participation of the poor, women, children, businesses in the informal sector and other disadvantaged groups in the development process.  If possible, however, USAID will look more broadly at the functioning of the criminal justice system and will seek to add GOI-sponsored reform efforts.

USAID will also look for ways to develop and support broad-based coalitions that can effectively monitor and lobby government for needed larger reforms.  Ideally, these coalitions will foster national, regional, and state policy discussions with affected groups on key issues, in the press or other public fora.  The aim is to forge a consensus on selected issues and advocate for enforcement and adoption of new initiatives, procedures, and legislation that will advance social justice and opportunity.  USAID will also strengthen key public and private sector institutions that can increase legal literacy, provide advice and resolve complaints. 

2.	Duties and Responsibilities of the Position

The USPSC Sr. Democracy and Governance Advisor will serve as team leader for the USAID/New Delhi Access to Justice/Rule of Law Sector Programs and Projects.

This serves as a notice of intent to award a contract on a sole-source basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, to Bell & Howell, 411 E. Roosevelt Ave, Zeeland, MI 49464.
