<DESC><p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to support the program entitled "Measure and Instrument Development and Support (MIDS). This program promotes the quality of healthcare by emphasizing major strategies for evaluating and improving care. Under multiple task orders, the contractors will assist CMS in developing, testing, refining, revising, maintaining, implementing, and publically reporting quality healthcare-specific measures.</p>
<p>The development and use of clinical quality measures remains a critical healthcare priority and the tool of choice for improving quality of care at the national, community and facility levels. The MIDS contract provides a vehicle to objectively evaluate and promote quality of care within the Federal quality reporting programs by aligning with the Measures Management Blueprint, a comprehensive and structured process for developing and maintaining evidence-based clinical quality measures (CQMs), including electronic CQMs, based on Electronic Health Records.</p>
<p>The nature of this highly technical work requires the expertise and services of qualified personnel, facilities, equipment, materials, and supplies not otherwise provided by the government, as needed to perform quality measurement program support activities. Development, revision, and/or maintenance of assessment instrument data items, data collection vehicles, and quality measures (including corresponding manuals, public outreach and coordination of data elements and measures with other MIDS contractors) comprise the fundamental activities under the IDIQ contract. The MIDS Contractor is required to have the expertise to successfully complete all activities specified in the Statement of Work, such as carrying out the environmental scan, developing new CQMs, conducting testing and analytics (including electronic measure specification), and providing technical support to the consensus entity endorsement process.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that CMS will award multiple indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract awards that will have a five (5) year ordering period with provisions for pricing arrangements including cost plus fixed fee, time and materials, labor hour, or fixed price contracts. Specific tasks and/or work to be performed will be detailed in, and solicited by, individual Task Orders. Task Orders will not be posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.</p>
<p>A pre-solicitation conference will take place on April 1, 2013 in the CMS auditorium at 7500 Security Blvd, Baltimore, MD 21244. This is a secured area and identification will be required. Interested parties wishing to attend the pre-solicitation conference must respond by March 25, 2013 with the names of the attendees. Potential offerors will be limited to two (2) attendees per company and one (1) additional person per subcontractor if using any subcontracting agreements. There will also be a call-in teleconference made available for those who are unable to attend in person and for any additional personnel from any companies in attendance. The key points that will be addressed in the pre-solicitation conference are:</p>
<p>&bull; IDIQ contract vehicle<br />&bull; Overall Statement of Work and Task Orders<br />&bull; Technical Considerations and Proposal Evaluation<br />&bull; Conflict of Interest<br />&bull; Question and Answer</p>
<p>Contractors must be free of conflicts of interest or prepare an OCI mitigation plan to address any actual, potential or apparent organizational conflicts of interest that could arise. Information concerning OCIs will be addressed at the pre-solicitation conference and subsequent solicitation.</p>
<p>CMS intends to solicit this requirement under full and open competition. This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP). CMS anticipates release of a Request for Proposal in April 2013. The solicitation will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. Contract awards are anticipated by September 30, 2013. It will be the offeror's responsibility to frequently check the same site where the solicitation is to be posted for any amendments, changes to the RFP issue and closing date.</p>
<p>The period of performance will be one base year plus four (4) one-year options. The NAICS code applicable to this procurement is 541690 (Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services) with a size standard of $14 million.</p>
<p>This synopsis is in reference to RFP-CMS-MIDS-2013-0001. A formal solicitation package will be available on or about the second week of April 2013. Proposals will be due approximately 45 days after the RFP issue date. Questions related to this synopsis should be referred to Irina Perl at Irina.Perl@cms.hhs.gov.</p>

<DESC>This is a request for information (RFI). DLA Troop Support's OCONUS Subsistence Prime Vendor (OCONUS SPV) Program is interested in your comments regarding full service food support to our military and federally funded customers in the Republic of Korea. There is no solicitation available at this time. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this RFI, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information provided to the Government. This RFI does not constitute a commitment from the Government and any information provided in response to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only and will not be released. Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked. Vendor participation is not a promise for future business with the Government. The sole purpose of this RFI is to conduct Market Research. <br /><br />Please consider the following questions:
<p>1.Currently product is brought in to Korea via the Defense Transportation System (DTS). DTS is the Department of Defense's system for coordinating routine requirements for military transportation. Does your firm anticipate bringing in product utilizing this system or are you currently bringing in product for your commercial distribution in Korea? Prime Vendor support includes the ability to source food items, to receive and consolidate materials, warehousing and inventory management, transportation capabilities, the ability to accept customer orders electronically and provide delivery, and the ability to maintain a quality assurance program. Can you provide Prime Vendor support to our customers located in Korea (Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force and other approved military and federal customers)?</p>
<p>2.A Government owned warehouse is available for use in Korea under any resultant contract. Though Government owned, the vendor would operate this facility (known as GOCO-Government Owned/Contractor Operated). The GOCO is currently used to store all Government Furnished Material (GFM), which are Unitized Group Rations (UGR) to support our Customers. Is there a possibility that you would use this facility or your own warehouse, located either within Korea or outside of Korea? Please explain.</p>
<p>3.The average weekly sales for Korea are about $576,923.00. Can your firm handle this? What is the dollar value of product going through your warehouse on a weekly basis?</p>
<p>4.Many of the customers expect delivery 48 hours after placing their orders, which is qualified as being the normal course of delivery. Can you accommodate this delivery schedule and how?</p>
<p>5.What is your normal lead time for orders? Under what circumstances do you have the ability to fill orders with shorter than the required lead time?</p>
<p>6.A Surge Requirement is one that could increase the normal orders by 300% in which you would be required to satisfy requirements for emergency situations (i.e., ramp up to meet early requirements (surge) and/or requirements that may exceed estimated annual quantities). How would you be able to accommodate this increase? What would be the time period to attain these increased quantities? How long could you continue to operate at this increased output of products?</p>
<p>7.Is your firm a large or small business concern? (Small business being defined as a firm that employs less than 500 employees).</p>

<DESC>Arcata Associates, Inc. has a requirement for 1 Each MGW 1100 Upgrade Kit, 1 Each 4xHD H.264 MGES-6000 Front Encoder Blade, 1 Each 4-CH HD/SD-SDI MGEI-6000-D REAR I/O BLADE, 1 Each Optibase Silver Service Program (Annual Contract). Arcata Associates, Inc. intends to purchase the items from OPTIBASE 2200 Centry Parkway Suite 900 Atlanta, GA 30345 We recommend that the Government acquire MGW 1100 Upgrade kit, 4xHD H.264 MGES-6000 Front Encoder Blade, $-CH HD/SD-SDI MGEL-6000-D Rear I/O Blade, Optibase Silver Service Program (Annual Contract), & Freight charges for FOB destination contracts by the procurement request 13-2787 by means other than full and open competition.	 This procurement will be awarded as a sole source.  Optibase will be responsible for delivering the software and hardware to allow DFRC to provide 4 additional HD channels on the IPTV (EZTV) system identified in the purchase request. This procurement will be procured under statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition, FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements (10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1)). Optibase is the only responsible source which is capable of satisfying the agency's unique need for the following reasons: a.	NASA Dryden Flight Research Center already owns over $100,000. Worth of hardware and equipment purchased specifically to work with the existing software we already have from Optibase. To attempt to purchase this hardware, software, and support from another source would entail replacing most, if not all of our existing equipment and that cost would be prohibitive. b.	Optibase is the only company that makes compatible hardware that integrates with the current system.  To go with another vendor for this same type of system would require replacing the entire system. This is cost prohibitive and would bring undue burden upon this program in cost and installation of a new product line. To eliminate the current system all together would result in not being able to stream video support for missions and Dryden distribution of NASA and mission related programing. Therefore, to stay with the current source is the most cost effective means to achieve this upgrade.	 c.	Schedule risk and cost will be significantly reduced through the utilization of an existing unique capability identical to that currently used by the IPTV (EZTV).  The time and cost of a detailed technical analysis of the capabilities provided by the Optibase Hardware and Silver Service Program will be avoided, and the time and cost of the development of an alternate solution will also be avoided. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 2:30 p.m. Pacific Time on March 29, 2013.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by  Arcata Associates, Inc. not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of Arcata Associates, Inc. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

<CONTACT>Karen Ruklic, Phone 208-983-5144, Fax 208-983-4098, Email kruklic@fs.fed.us - Maple Stuivenga, Procurement Technician, Phone 2089834002, Email mstuivenga@fs.fed.us
<DESC>The project involves floodplain restoration on approximately 9 acres adjacent to Upper Newsome Creek and reconstruction of Haysfork Sediment Pond. The activities will mitigate the environmental impacts of past dredge and placer mining. The work includes the regrading floodplain along with associated dredge pile relocation, earthwork and revegetation. Work at the sediment pond includes removal of existing features and construction of a new spillway. Revegetation of the disturbed sites will consist of erosion control seeding and on-site transplants only.
<p>A contractor will be required to provide a qualified stream restoration specialist to represent them and supervise during the following construction activities: 1) equipment operation required for site access (setting temporary bridges at stream crossings), 2) equipment operation within the active channel or on stream banks, 3) floodplain construction quality control (Government estimates 2 days per week) and 4) sediment pond spillway construction. The representative shall possess a Bachelor's degree in fish biology, hydrology, geomorphology, engineering or a related field, at a minimum, though a Master's degree is preferred. In addition, the representative shall possess a minimum of 10 years related experience and a minimum of 3-5 years of experience performing/overseeing similar stream restoration projects.</p>
<p>The project is located on the Red River Ranger District, Nez Perce National Forest, Idaho County, Idaho. To reach the project site, travel approximately 40 miles east of Grangeville via State Highway 14 to the junction with Newsome Creek Road (Forest Service Road 1858). Proceed up Newsome Creek Road, past the old Newsome Townsite, approximately 7 miles to a gated access road that takes off sharply uphill and to the right. This road can be identified by the large boulders that have been placed by the gate. A similar road takes off just prior to this access road but no boulders are present. Motorized access is prohibited. The project site is located approximately 1 &frac12; miles from the gate. A formal pre-bid tour is not planned at this time. <br /><br />The estimated price range for the project if the base and all optional items are awarded is between $500,000-$1,000,000. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued in late March 2013 with implementation planned for the Summer/Fall of 2013. Snow, high water, and saturated ground conditions typically restrict equipment access until early July. This project constitutes Phase III of a multi-phase project. Phases I and II, located upstream from the current project area, were completed in 2011 and 2012.</p>

<DESC><strong>Introduction</strong><br />The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.  The NIAID, Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation, has a requirement for continuing the NIH Tetramer Core Facility contract.  The scope of activities to be conducted by the NIH Tetramer Core Facility Contractor include synthesis and distribution of soluble MHC-peptide tetramer and related reagents to the global research community, and performance of research and development to improve tetramer technologies and increase the types of products available to the biomedical research community.  Such reagents include, but are not limited to, mouse, non-human primate, human, and other mammalian MHC class I monomers and tetramers; custom and pre-made mouse, non-human primate, human, and other mammalian class II tetramers; non-classical MHC TL, Qa-1, and mammalian CD1 monomers and tetramers; CD1d and other MHC ligands; and fluorophores for tetramer labeling/detection.<br /><br /><strong>Description</strong><br />The scope of activities to be carried out by the NIH Tetramer Core Facility Contractor is: synthesis and distribution of soluble MHC-peptide tetramer and related reagents to the global research community; and performance of research and development to improve tetramer technologies and increase the types of products available to the biomedical research community. Such reagents include, but are not limited to, mouse, non-human primate, human, and other mammalian MHC class I monomers and tetramers; custom and pre-made mouse, non-human primate, human, and other mammalian class II tetramers; non-classical MHC TL, Qa-1, and mammalian CD1 monomers and tetramers; CD1d and other MHC ligands; and fluorophores for tetramer detection.
<p>The major functions to be carried out by the contractor are:<br />A. Operate a tetramer production facility<br />B. Operate a distribution, tracking, and reporting system of reagents produced<br />C. Maintain a NIH Tetramer Core Facility website and provide related maintenance<br />D. Conduct tetramer technology research and development<br />E. Manage the Tetramer Core Facility program</p>
<p>While the NIH Tetramer Core Facility is responsible for providing ligands (peptidic and nonpeptidic) for all pre-made reagents (where required), the NIH Tetramer Core Facility is NOT responsible for supplying ligands for custom MHC Class I and II monomer and tetramer production. Ligands for custom monomer/tetramer synthesis will be provided by the approved requestors, where required.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that one cost reimbursement term, level of effort contract will be awarded for a 1-year period of performance beginning on or about 3/1/2013.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition, on behalf of the National Institute on Mental Health (NIMH), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Nikon Instruments Inc., 1300 Walt Whitman Road, Floor 2, Melville, NY, 11747-3064, for the purchase of one Nikon A1, N-SIM, N-Storm confocal microscope for NIMH Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Signaling in Bethesda, Maryland. The period of performance is three months from date of award.</p>
<p>The National Institute on Mental Health (NIMH) has a requirement for one Nikon A1, N-SIM, N-Storm confocal microscope for NIMH Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Signaling which is manufactured by Nikon Instruments Inc.  NIMH requires the A1, N-SIM, N-Storm confocal microscope to conduct scientific research which will allow for the high resolution microscopy of biological samples.  Specifically, the SIM and STORM components of the A1, N-SIM, N-Storm confocal microscope allow for more precise visual investigation.  The 10x resolution over conventional confocal microscopy allows more precise understanding of cellular cytoarchitecture as well as protein to protein interactions which are critical to understanding neurobiological cell biology.  This unique system also allows for 2x magnification over conventional technology for live-cell imaging that will increase the precision of the laboratory's understanding of protein interactions and localization.</p>
<p>Nikon Instruments Inc. is the only manufacturer authorized to sell the complete Nikon A1, N-SIM, N-Storm system configuration. There are no other vendors authorized to sell the complete integrated system.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being conducted using policies unique to the acquisition of commercial items prescribed in FAR Part 12, in conjunction with the policies and procedures for solicitation, evaluation, and award prescribed in Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the competition requirements of Part 6. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Comments to this announcement, referencing this synopsis number, may be submitted to the NIDA SS/SA Branch, prior to the closing date specified in this announcement, electronically to the attention of John Flannery, at flanneryje@mail.nih.gov.</p>

<DESC>This procurement is an Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) opportunity at the Naval Submarine Base New London (NSBNL), Groton, Connecticut.  The proposed site is comprised of paved and unimproved area totaling approximately 4.3 acres.  The site available for lease is located at the southeast ("SE") corner of NSBNL at the intersection of Crystal Lake Road and Route 12.  NSBNL is on the east bank of the Thames River, partially located in both, the Town of Groton, Connecticut and the Town of Ledyard, Connecticut, approximately 55 miles from Providence, RI, 50 miles from New Haven, CT, and 55 miles from Hartford, CT.  The EUL site is located within the fence line of NSBNL, which is a closed base, not open to the general public.  Ingress and egress to the site could potentially be obtained from public roads Route 12 or Crystal Lake Road by repositioning the existing security fence.
Procurement Process:
The Navy is seeking a lessee to establish, operate and maintain a retail/recreational development that will enhance the quality of life for Navy personnel and the surrounding community and serve as the primary economic driver of the site in exchange for in-kind-consideration not less than the fair market value of the leasehold interest in the real property.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division (NSWCCD) Philadelphia, intends to enter into negotiations, on a sole source basis, with Kato Engineering Inc., 2075 Howard Drive, North Mankato, MN 56003, to procure Generator Automatic Voltage Regulator assembly kits in support of NAVY LPD-17 class ships.  These kits consist of (4) Logic Racks and (4) Power Racks.  The material included in these kits must meet operational and reliability requirements, the achievement of which, require unique production techniques and testing.

The materials to be purchased through this action have been designed, developed and are solely manufactured by Kato Engineering Inc.  The Government has yet to acquire or develop the technical data in order to be able to solicit and have these items manufactured on the open market.
  As a result, the proposed action cannot be processed on the basis of full and open competition since the Government does not possess full legal rights to the essential data in whole or in part. 

The Government, therefore, intends to solicit and negotiate this requirement under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c)(1), FAR 6.302-1.  A Firm Fixed Price contract is anticipated.

The applicable NAICS Code for this requirement is 335312.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any and all responses must be received within 15 days of this synopsis notice. A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based on the responses received to this synopsis is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division (NSWCCD) of Bethesda, MD plans to enter into a sole-source, firm fixed price purchase order with MTS Systems Corporation of Eden Prairie, MN to provide on-site repair and calibration services on MTS servo hydraulic equipment, i.e., fatigue test machines, extensometers, and lock systems.  The applicable NAICS Code is 334519, Other Measuring and Controlling Device Manufacturer, and the business size standard is 500 employees.   

The requirement will be negotiated on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1; only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements.
  The basis for restricting competition is for the following reasons: MTS in-house field service engineers are trained to perform repairs and calibrations to code on MTS equipment.  The manufacturer, MTS, can void repair warranties should an outside technician service their equipment.  

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

However, the NECO webpage serves as an alternative if the FBO website is unavailable.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternate in case FBO is unavailable.

The Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) intends to issue multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) in accordance with Simplified Acquisition procedures, Part 13 of the FAR for FSC 5962 (Printed Circuit Boards) and 5998 (Bared Printed Circuit Board, Electrical and Electronic Assemblies, Cards, and Associated Hardware).
  Please note that a BPA is not a contract. A BPA is a streamlined method for acquiring services on an as-needed basis from qualified sources that are readily available and thus eliminate the need for repetitive costly re-procurements.    All calls/orders must be acknowledged by the selected vendor in order to be retained on the BPA calling list. The Government will not be issuing a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) because this notice will result in BPAs.  In addition, the Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this notice.   The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this notice 

This synopsis is open to all business concerns; however, in accordance with FAR 19.501, the Governments intent is to establish BPAs with small businesses.
 In the event there arent enough responses from responsible, capable small businesses, then large business responses will be considered.  Individual call numbers shall not exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold of $150,000.  Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13 will be utilized.   The Government reserves the right to add/delete vendors at any time throughout the life of the BPA. There is no minimum or maximum Government obligation.  In compliance with DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests (MAR 2008), the government will utilize Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) (https://wawf.eb.mil/)  to electronically process vendor requests for payment.  

Interested parties are requested to provide their Cage Code and DUNS numbers for verification of inclusion in the SAM (System for Award Management) database.
  VENDORS CURRENTLY HOLDING A BPA WITH NSWCDD DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  Responsibility determinations will also precede issuance of a BPA and will be conducted in accordance with FAR 9.104.  Interested parties are encouraged to address the seven elements of responsibility contained in FAR 9.104 and to complete FAR Clause 52.219-1.  

BPAs will be issued on the basis of past performance.  Interested vendors should provide a minimum of five (5) past performance references.  These references should include name of business, address, phone number, point of contact, contract/purchase order number and item description.  Past performance will be evaluated based upon quality and timeliness of delivery.
  The government reserves the right to use additional past performance references if necessary.  FAILURE TO SUPPLY THE REQUESTED INFORMATION WILL AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO BE AWARDED A BPA.  

Delivery shall be FOB Destination to Dahlgren, Virginia.  All BPA calls/orders shall be issued on a firm fixed price basis.  Companies interested in receiving a BPA shall submit the requested documentation no later than 15 April 2013 to the attention of Kimberly Curtin, Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division, 17632 Dahlgren Road, Suite 157, Dahlgren, VA 22448-5110 or via email to: kimberly.curtin@navy.mil .

This solicitation is one of four solicitations to be placed under the approved Acquisition Plan for construction within SWD and its surrounding areas.<br><br>SCOPE OF WORK:  Construction services are to include, but is not limited to: construction, renovation, repairs and alterations, preventive maintenance, environmental abatement, and operations activities.  Anticipated execution of MATOC contracts are intended for new construction, design-build and design-bid-build facilities.

The maximum combination of orders is $30,000,000.  The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation. Task orders issued as a result of HubZone contracts will be firm-fixed price.  The minimum guarantee for the HUBZone MATOC contract is $2,500 that applies to the base period only. The minimum guarantee amount will be applicable to the base period only.  Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated with the issuance of task orders. <br><br>CONTRACT INFORMATION: HUBZone solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process.  In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as "Offerors") may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the performance capacity in accordance with the criteria described in Phase 1 solicitation and intends to select no more than five (5) of the Offerors to compete in Phase 2.  In addition, the Government reserves the right to select more than five (5) of the Phase 1 Offerors if, in the opinion of the Source Selection Authority, consideration of additional Offerors is warranted. In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal.  The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.  To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the initial task at time of contract award unless funds are not available to award.  In that case, the Government will award the contract with the minimum guarantee.  <br><br>The following evaluation (rating) criteria listed below shall be used in this solicitation unless modified by amendment prior to receipt of proposals:<br><br> 	Phase 1 - VOLUME 1: Past Performance; and Organization and Technical Approach   <br><br>	Phase 2 - Volume 2: Design Technical; Proposed Contract Duration and Summary Schedule; and Small Business Participation.  All technical factors when combined are significantly more important than Price (Volume 3).  <br><br>Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about 08/06/2012 under solicitation number W9126G-12-R-0070.  Phase 1 Proposals are anticipated to be due no later than 09/21/2012 (30 - 45 days from issuance of the solicitation).  If the Government elects to conduct a Pre-Proposal Conference and site visit, it will be conducted after the Phase 2 selection has been made.  Details regarding the Conference will be provided by amendment to the solicitation.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction), which corresponds to SIC 1542.  The Small Business Size Standard is $33.5 Million.    <br><br>MATOC:  Each task order will be awarded pursuant to FAR 16.505 Ordering and in accordance with the task order terms and conditions including the designated SOW.    All contracts will remain active unless or until (1) the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; (2) contract expiration; (3) task order completion; (4) the capacity  is reached; or (5) the contract is terminated for convenience or default by the Government.  There must be a minimum of at least two awards to create this  MATOC pool but, if there are not enough Offerors in this pool to establish at least two or more contract awards, the remaining contract capacity of that MATOC pool will be distributed by; (1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the pools that have not been awarded, or (2) re-advertising the solicitation after ensuring that the evaluation criteria established in the solicitation were not overly restrictive which resulted in limiting competition.  Option 1 would not be a viable solution if all other pools have been awarded.  If option 1 is not viable and the evaluation criteria have been reviewed then SWD reserves the right to solicit an additional MATOC pool only for the amount of the un-awarded capacity. New market research will be conducted to determine the appropriate set-aside, if any, for the MATOC for the un-awarded capacity.  Each small business synopsis and solicitation would notify potential Offerors of this reservation.    <br><br>The total estimated contract capacity is $63,960,000.  The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months with up to 4 Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of 60 months.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract for a lesser duration than stated herein if it is determined in the best interests of the Government.  <br><br>The anticipated solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition.  There will be no public bid opening. This solicitation is set-aside for competitive HUBZone businesses only.  Plans and Specifications will not be provided in a hard paper copy since electronic copy of the solicitation with specifications and drawings will be posted on Fed Biz Opps (www.fbo.gov). Offerors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and not a debarred Contractor in order to be considered for a Government award contract. <br><br><br>

<DESC>Introduction and Purpose:<br />This is not a notice of Solicitation Issuance. This is a request for information (RFI) for planning purposes only.<br />With this RFI, the Department of the Air Force is requesting information from interested parties regarding a potential transaction under which a non-federal private or public entity would operate an Air Force golf course. Specifically, the Air Force is requesting information as it pertains to the potential operation of a golf course located at Vandenberg Air Force Base (AFB) in Santa Barbara County, CA. The Air Force plans to use information received in response to this RFI in determining whether to issue a solicitation for the project and, if so, to assist in development of the content for the solicitation. <br />Background Information:<br />The Air Force views public-private or public-public ventures, generally referred to as "community partnerships," as a potential way of capitalizing on the expertise and resources of the private or local government sector to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome. <br />The Air Force has several tools available to enter into community partnerships, in addition to standard acquisition procedures. One example is Enhanced Use Leases, under which the Air Force leases under-utilized real property to public or private entities for not less than fair market value, for which the Air Force can receive as cash or in-kind consideration. Another example is Intergovernmental Support Agreements with state and local governmental entities, under which the Air Force can receive, provide or share installation support services to enhance mission effectiveness or promote economic efficiency. <br />Description of Project or Need: <br />Vandenberg AFB is located in Santa Barbara County, CA outside the cities of Lompoc and Santa Maria. The 18-hole golf course, known as Marshallia Ranch, is considered one of the top places to play within the Air Force portfolio of golf courses. The course sits adjacent to the oldest building on the installation, Marshallia Ranch House. Opening in 1958, Marshallia Ranch Golf Course sits outside the fence line of the main base and is open to the general public; without any need for background checks or military sponsorship. Vandenberg currently has a waiver for non-DoD affiliated personnel to play on the course, in accordance with Air Force Instructions (AFIs) 34-262 and 34-116 (renewable every two years). <br />Vandenberg FY12 FY11 FY10 FY09 FY08<br /># Holes 18 18 18 18 18<br />Total Rounds 24,054 23,567 26,718 30,961 31,760 <br />Total Revenue $1,006,480 $970,280 $1,199,860 $1,264,170 $1,379,780<br />Net Income After Depreciation $(130,959) $(286,369) $(105,022) $(9,9963) $45,215

Do you envision any new development on the property?<br />6. What are the current conditions, circumstances and constraints that will impact your interest and ability in submitting a detailed proposal in response to a solicitation?<br />7. Would you suggest alternative uses for this property?<br />8. What additional information from the Air Force would be helpful to you in submitting a more detailed proposal in response to a solicitation?<br />Handling and Processing:<br />The Air Force will consider all submittals responsive to this RFI for purposes of deciding whether to issue a solicitation and to develop the content for the solicitation. The Air Force may hold all responses received for an extended period of time or may destroy them. In no case will the Air Force return any responses to the originator.

The Air Force will safeguard such information in accordance with the applicable federal regulations.

The 18-hole golf course, known as Silver Spruce, opened in 1973 and offers golfers views of the Rocky Mountains. Anyone with identification clearance through the installation gate can play. Peterson does not have a non-DoD civilian waiver like at Vandenberg AFB and Patrick AFB. Members of the general public without military sponsorship can file for a gate pass that is good for one year. These passes generally take one to two weeks to obtain. The course opened the back 9 holes in 1972 and the front nine holes in 1976. They were designed by architect Dick Phelps and a new driving range and teaching facility was added in 2009.<br />Peterson FY12 FY11 FY10 FY09 FY08<br /># Holes 18 18 18 18 18<br />Total Rounds 29,254 29,016 20,344 25,631 35,195 <br />Total Revenue $1,019,820 $1,055,090 $1,108,700 $1,093,600 $1,161,970<br />Net Income After Depreciation $(128,100) $14,632 $16,478 $45,427 $(122,426)</p>

This 18-hole golf course offers spectacular views to its patrons through its location between the Banana River and Atlantic Ocean. The 260 acre parcel, known as Manatee Cove Golf Course, is home to many wildlife animal species. As the Patrick AFB Golf Course is located "inside the fence line", Manatee Cove currently has a waiver for non-DoD affiliated personnel to play on the course, IAW AFIs 34-262 and 34-116 (renewable every two years). All civilians, no matter if they have a sponsor or not, must be cleared by applying for civilian base access. This process can take up to fourteen days to complete but is good for one year. The course opened in 1961 and was designed by architect Robert Trent Jones Sr. A new clubhouse was added in 2007 and new green complexes were added in 2008.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
Immunoassay Reagent for the Detection of Hydrocodone and/or Hydromorphone in Urine Specimens Applicable for Use on the Hitachi / Roche Modular D and P High Speed Analyzer Systems

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTES.  THIS IS A NOTICE OF THE GOVERNMENTS INTERST TO OBTAIN AN IMMUNOASSAY REAGENT FOR THE HIGHLY SPECIFIC DETECTION OF HYDROCODONE AND/OR HYDROMORPHONE IN URINE SPECIMENS AS OPPOSED TO OTHER OPIATES SUCH AS CODEINE, MORPHINE, OXYCODONE, OXYMORPHONE AND OTHER OPIATE ANALOGUES.  THE IMMUNOASSAY REAGENT MUST BE SUITABLE FOR USE WITHOUT MODIFICATION ON THE ROCHE HITACHI MODDULAR- D AND P HIGH SPEED ANALYZER SYSTEMS 
	
This is a Request for Information (RFI), as defined by FAR 2.101, and the Government is not requesting offers or proposals at this time.
  Any responses to this RFI received by the Government will not be accepted to form a binding contract. This is a market survey for planning purposes and no award will be made as a result of this RFI.  If a solicitation is issued, the Government does not guarantee that it will be issued to RFI respondents.  The Government is also requesting that restrictive or proprietary markings not be used in response to the RFI.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if one is issued.

The Department of Defense (DoD) Drug Demand Reduction Program (DDRP) is conducting a market survey to determine current interest, capabilities, comments and questions regarding an immunoassay urine reagent kit for the detection of hydrocodone and/or hydromorphone abuse in urine to support the DoD DDRP Laboratories worldwide.
 Responses to this RFI must address the topic areas specified below.

The DoD DDRP performs testing for a number of drugs of abuse to include codeine, morphine, oxycodone, and oxymorphone.  In 2012, hydrocodone and hydromorphone was added to the testing panel.  In order to maximize efficiency, the DoD DDRP started using a prescription medication database to compare positive service member test results with their medication to determine whether a valid prescription is the cause for the positive result.  Due to the high cross-reactivity of existing opiate (codeine and morphine) immunoassay kits with hydrocodone and/or hydromorphone, it is not currently possible to validate a positive opiate screening result against the prescription database.
  The DoD DDRP is interested in seeing if a kit exists that can separate out the positive hydrocodone and/or hydromorphone specimens from the positive opiate (codeine and morphine) specimens. 

The DoD DDRP conducts testing at six Forensic Toxicology Drug Testing Laboratories (FTDTLs).  Each location currently uses the Roche-Hitachi Modular (D and P) Analyzer System.  The program has a mission critical requirement to conduct random urinalysis testing, not only for illicit drugs of abuse, but also for commonly prescribed opiate medications whose potential for misuse and addiction is recognized by the Drug Enforcement Administration scheduling of these medications.
   
The salient characteristics desired by the DoD DDRP are:
1)	The immunoassay must be highly specific for the detection of hydrocodone and/or hydromorphone as compared to other common opiate and opioid medications such as codeine, morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, 6-monoacetylmorphine, and other opiate / opioid analogues.
2)	The immunoassay is for use in a urine based matrix.
 
3)	The immunoassay reagent system must be compatible for use on the Roche Hitachi modular D and P high speed analyzer system without modification or interference with other testing systems in use on the analyzer system.
4)	The immunoassay system must be able to sensitive to the detection of hydrocodone and/or hydromorphone when present alone or in combination at a calibration concentration of 100 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL).  The reagent must have a detection capability to reproducibly correctly discriminate urine specimens and controls with drug concentrations above and below the 100 ng/mL calibration concentration.

Information Request
The Government seeks informed input and questions from interested companies regarding technical requirements and contractual descriptions regarding an immunoassay urine reagent kit for the detection of hydrocodone and/or hydromorphone abuse in urine.
  Attachment 1 contains a sample, theoretical Statement of Work (SOW) which details the projected requirements interested responders shall base their submission upon.  This sample does NOT indicate that the Government will contract for any of the supplies or services discussed within; it is merely a forecast of potential requirements to generate interest and feedback from companies in order to better inform the Government.  Responses will not be rated but will be reviewed as part of an information gathering process.  

To ensure responses, including attachments, can be read and evaluated, please submit in Microsoft (MS) Word, MS Excel, or Adobe Acrobat format.  Responses including attached files shall not exceed 10 MB in total.
 Responses exceeding 10 MB will not be transmitted through the Government server.

Responses should include:  (1) A cover letter on organizational letterhead including the Company name, CAGE code, DUNS code, point of contact, address, phone number, fax number, and e-mail address of the submitting agent; (2) A white paper, consisting of the requested information; and (3) Any attachments and supporting documentation felt to be relevant to a deeper investigation of the response. 

The white paper shall address the following two sections:

Section 1 - Technical Requirements
While responding directly to the sample Statement of Work (SOW) within Attachment 1, the white paper shall address the technical requirements based on the SOW provided within the Attachment.
  This should be a brief, informal section stating any specific interest, inquiries, capabilities, solutions, expertise, and past experience related to the technical requirements listed in the SOW.  Comments and suggested revisions to the SOW are also requested.

Section 2 - Questions
1)	Is your company currently producing an immunoassay urine reagent kit for the detection of hydrocodone and/or hydromorphone abuse in urine that is able to meet the requirements based on the SOW provided in the Attachment 1? 
2)	If not, does your company plan on producing an immunoassay urine reagent kit for the detection of hydrocodone and/or hydromorphone? If so, how long would it take to be able to meet such requirement?
3)	If your company is currently in the process of producing a hydrocodone and/or hydromorphone reagent kit, at what stage of production is the kit at? What is the predicted date of completion?

No telephonic submissions will be honored.
  All responses shall be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government.  Interested parties should respond within 60 days of the posting date.  Interested parties are requested to electronically send their response to the Naval Medical Logistics Command via e-mail to:  Nicholas.Dankanich@med.navy.mil (SUBJECT: N6264513RFI04 Hydro's RFI).  No phone calls please.

<DESC>This sources sought announcement is for acquisition planning purposes and no formal solicitation exists at this time. All qualified concerns may submit capability statements for consideration. Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the technical, experience, administrative, management, and financial capability of such offerors to perform this type of work. The capability statements will be used to determine appropriate procurement strategy, in particular whether a set-aside is warranted or an alternate procurement strategy is warranted.
The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) is looking for qualified sources to design, fabricate, deliver, and install a compliment of seven metal shade canopies over the Hoover Dam Visitor Center Escalator.  Metal shade canopies shall be customized to fit the site each with a freestanding monopole-type design. 
Work is located in the vicinity of Hoover Dam and Powerplant, approximately 9 miles east of Boulder City, Nevada and 31 miles southeast of Las Vegas, Nevada (Clark County).  The site is located adjacent to the highway bridge at the Hoover Dam Visitor Center on NV S.R.172 (old Hwy 93) in Clark County, Nevada.  NV S.R. 172 passes through the site and is managed and maintained by the Nevada Department of Traffic (NDOT).  The approximate elevation at the site ranges from 1,205 feet at the bottom of the escalator to 1,240 feet at the top of the escalator.
The principal components of the work to be performed shall be to design, fabricate, deliver, and install (Turn-Key) multiple, custom, freestanding, durable, metal shade canopies including bolted steel base connections for the monopole.  The steel monopole shall be a welded cylindrical or rectangular metal tube support framing.  Each monopole shall be anchored inside the water feature to a steel cross member which is anchored (bolted) inside both vertical sides of the water feature by the use of steel plates and expansion anchors.  The bottom steel cross member should not touch the base of the water feature to allow for proper drainage.  The monopole shall be designed to be removable.  Excavation below the water feature is not anticipated.  
The shade canopies shall be comprised of, ribbed steel roof sloped (1-2%) to provide adequate runoff for rainwater, associated center post roof drains and integral perimeter gutters, flush, perimeter fascia without ornamentation, components, rain chains and accessories capable of shading a horizontal distance of 84-foot-long by 24-foot-wide area over the outdoor escalators at the entrance to the Hoover Dam Visitor Center.  The metal canopies, monopole supports, and steel base connection system must match color specified (RAL 8011), or very similar color.
Each shade canopy shall be 12-foot-long, 24-foot-wide comprised of two 12-foot-long by 12-foot-wide hot-dip metallic-coated steel sheet prepainted by the coil coating process.  Shade panels shall be mounted at a height to provide minimum headroom clearance of nine (9) feet at the canopy's lowest point on either side of the center support column above the adjacent escalator stair tread or adjacent stairs; the canopies shall be capable of withstanding the effects of gravity loads, non-uniformly applied loads, thermal movements, excessive, sustained wind loads (100+ mph) and other uplift and downward stresses within limits and under conditions indicated for the specific location where the canopies will be installed.  
Rainwater runoff shall be directed toward the center of each canopy into a gutter to a point or points above the center of the escalators.  Rain chains attached to the canopy gutter drain(s) shall convey runoff safely to the water feature drainage structure below.  The bottom of the rain chains shall be affixed to the water feature drainage structure with stainless steel fasteners with the requisite amount of slack to prevent stress or strain on the chains or on the canopy.  The drainage system shall be designed for maximum runoff anticipated for this region of the country.  The rain chains shall be powder-coated to match the color of the canopy or treated to inhibit rust if coloration is similar to the canopy finish. 
Installation at the site will take place after business hours (7 pm - 7 am) to avoid impacts to the visitors.  Site must be cleaned after each shift to remove any debris, materials, and tools.  A staging area approximately one (1) mile away from the work site will be provided for material storage.  Direct access for vehicles or large equipment to the escalators is not available.  The highway bridge (N.V. S.R. 172) approximately 70 feet from site must be used for any cranes or large equipment.  As this is a state highway, traffic control will be required and is a contractor responsibility.  Overhead powerlines are above the site; which will require proper grounding of equipment and other safety protocols.
Interested vendors are invited to submit capability packages describing the products/services they provide related to meeting the above requirements.  Packages shall include but not limited to the following information: (1) Provide business name, address, business size and socio-economic type (8(a), HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran, Small Business, Large Business, etc.), and point of contact to include e-mail address and telephone number; (2) Demonstrate the firm's experience, of project in similar size and complexity, by providing a list of projects completed where the work involved designing, fabrication, delivery, and installation of metal shade structures of a freestanding monopole-type design which was completed within the past five years and in which your firm performed the installation.  Specify in the list the extent of work completed by your firm and that work which was subcontracted.  Additionally, for each project listed, provide the following: a brief description of the work performed, project title, dollar value of the job, the facility or site name and location, and the customer's contact name and phone number for the work completed; and (3) Provide at least three (3) references to include Name(s) and telephone number(s) of references from the acquiring agency or customer who may be contacted for further information.
Capability statements are to be submitted no later than March 27, 2013.   
Should you be interested in this effort, please submit a capability package to Kelli Adams, Contract Specialist, via e-mail to kadams@usbr.gov.  The subject line shall clearly reference the Solicitation Number associated with the announcement.
When it is determined that a formal solicitation will be issued, a pre-solicitation notice will be posted on Federal Business Opportunities web site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes an RFI notice for planning purposes.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP).  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.
Air Combat Electronics (PMA 209), in support of the Director, Air Warfare (N98), is surveying industry for capabilities to provide an encrypted Aircraft Wireless Internal Communication System (AWICS) that can meet the requirements of air and ground crew members performing duties in the back of the aircraft, while dismounted from the aircraft, and during hoist and other normal aircraft operations.  PMA 209 will use the RFI respondents' information to formulate acquisition approaches and plan for appropriate future investments. 

AWICS was established to eliminate the entanglement hazards posed by the Internal Communications System (ICS) long cord component currently used by air and ground crew members on rotary wing, tilt rotor, and fixed wing aircraft.
  Incorporation of this wireless technology will enable safer communication between air and ground crew members during all phases of ground and flight operations.  The Navy's (on behalf of Naval Aviation: Navy and Marine Corps) principal requirement is to eliminate the long cord entanglement hazard.

The government encourages industry to respond to this RFI even if your system does not meet all of the current AWICS requirements, as the responses will assist the finalization of the requirements generation process.  Therefore, there is a possibility that not all desired performance characteristics stated herein will be included in the potential AWICS solution.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD - SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT <br>  <br> PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:  The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), has a requirement to maintain the Authority to Operate (ATO) of the fielded Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT).   <br>  <br> The Program Office has decided the best way to meet this requirement is to update the current Rockwell EPX IG's from Windows XP/embedded XP to a Windows 7 based Operating System (OS).  This necessitates the need to update the current hardware to support Windows 7.  The Government plans to acquire the new hardware under a separate contracting action through the Computer Hardware Enterprise Software and Solutions (CHESS).  The existing proprietary EPX software will need to be modified to run on the new OS and hardware.  <br>  <br> ACQUISITION APPROACH:  The Government anticipates that the program requirement will be fulfilled by a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and one Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) option to Rockwell Collins of Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  The Government intends to pursue a sole source award to Rockwell Collins in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1,  quote mark Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requierments. quote mark  <br>  <br> This effort will consist of a base effort of identifying a hardware solution specification that will run the current proprietary EPX-50 Image Generator (IG) software with windows 7 OS, and testing a first article of the new hardware with the modified EPX license.  This effort will have options that would include Rockwell accepting the new IG hardware as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and then create, test and field installation kits to the fielded AVCATT suite locations.  This also includes adding some key visual enhancements into the existing EPX-50 software to support current and future training requirements.  The period of performance for this effort is from August 2013 through May 2016.   <br>  <br> ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  The estimated contract value is $10M. <br>  <br> NOTICE:  This notice is provided to verify that no other sources can meet this requirement given the data necessary for this effort is Rockwell Collins proprietary.  In addition, this notification is provided for contractors interested in teaming/subcontracting opportunities. <br>   <br> DISCLAIMER:   This notice does not constitute an invitation for bids or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products.   No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this notification.   The Government will use the information received to determine whether other sources are available and capable to satisfy this requirement.

<div>FBO Classification: &nbsp;R499</div>
<div>NAICS: &nbsp;711510</div>
<div></div>
<div>Description:</div>
<div></div>
<div>The General Services Administration (GSA) Art in Architecture Program commissions American artists (citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents or Permanent Workers of the United States) to create publicly scaled and permanently installed artworks for federal buildings nationwide.</div>
<div></div>
<div>GSA announces an opportunity for a federal art commission in conjunction with the&nbsp;</div>
<div>modernization of the Land Port of Entry (LPOE) at Derby Line, Vermont. &nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>GSA will modernize the facility to meet the needs of the primary tenant, Customs and Border Protection. &nbsp;This modernization project is a pivotal undertaking in remodeling and upgrading the facility. &nbsp;It will include the design and renovation of the Main Port Building; the construction of a new Commercial Inspection and Non-Commercial Inspection Buildings. The canopies and booths will be replaced and will include modifications and enhancements to the bus lane, sidewalk, curbing, and islands.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>GSA allocates one-half of one percent of the estimated construction costs of new or modernized federal buildings for art commissions. &nbsp;The art budget for the Derby Line LPOE project is currently estimated to be $80,000. &nbsp;One or more artists will be awarded a fixed-price contract for a commission.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Artists who wish to be considered for this and all future GSA art commissions must submit application materials to GSA&rsquo;s National Artists Registry (Registry). &nbsp;The Registry constitutes the qualified list of artists for this and all GSA commissions. &nbsp;Instructions on how to join the Registry are available on the following Web site:</div>
<div></div>
<div>www.gsa.gov/artinarchitecture</div>
<div></div>
<div>All artists who wish to be considered as candidates for a commission at the Derby Line LPOE in Derby Line, Vermont, must have their application materials submitted and received by GSA by 3:00 PM Eastern Time on April 15, 2013. &nbsp;Artists&rsquo; submissions received after the deadline will not be considered for this project, but will be eligible for consideration on future GSA commissions alongside the other artists on the Registry. &nbsp;Artists already on the Registry need not resubmit, but may elect to update their information prior to the deadline.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>GSA evaluates artists based on the following criteria: the media, materials, content, style, and scope of the artist&rsquo;s past work, along with the artist&rsquo;s past performance and experience with commissions or projects similar to the one described in this synopsis. &nbsp;Short-listed artists will be contacted and asked to submit additional information including a statement that he or she can perform the work associated with the GSA commission within the identified budget. &nbsp;GSA will count the combined weight of all the selection criteria as significantly more important than price.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>At a minimum, the scope of services for this commission will require: collaboration with the lead designer selected for the building project; development of preliminary and final concepts; fabrication of the artwork; participation in meetings and conservation reviews as necessary; and the installation of the artwork at the project site. &nbsp;</div>

<DESC>NOTE:  THIS IS NOT A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE.  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE SEEKING SMALL BUSINESSES (Please see attached document for details).
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Central Mineral and Environmental Resources Science Center, Denver, CO has a requirement to purchase a high-resolution multiple-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) for high-precision measurements of the isotope ratios of elements in geological, hydrological, and biological materials (lithium to uranium).  This MC-ICP-MS will support projects within the CMER, CGG, FORT, CER, and GEC Science Centers, as well as projects from other programs and Science Centers within the USGS.
The USGS is seeking small business sources for a multiple-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) that meets the following requirements:
1. The MC-ICPMS shall use double focusing ion optics (i.e., both electrostatic and magnetic sectors) designed for high mass resolution and highly precise and accurate isotopic measurements of elements from lithium to uranium.
2. The instrument shall have a multiple-collector array with discrete dynode multipliers for the ion-counting system, and either (a) movable Faraday detectors or (b) fixed Faraday detector positions and variable dispersion (Zoom) optics.  The collector array of the instrument shall be able to accommodate at least two full-sized discrete dynode multipliers, up to three additional ion counters (either full-sized or compact discrete dynode multipliers), and a minimum of one retardation filter to increase the abundance sensitivity.
3. The instrument shall have high abundance sensitivity.  The abundance sensitivity, defined as the baseline at mass 237 with a large 238U signal (>410-11 A), shall be less than 5 ppm for all collectors.  Abundance sensitivity for any ion-counting detectors fitted with a retardation filter shall be less than 500 ppb.
4. The instrument shall have the ability to operate at a range of user-selectable resolving powers.
5. The instrument shall have state-of-the-art electronics with protection trips, and the ability to monitor all instrument parameters and the status of the power supplies using the computer software.
6. The operating mass range of the instrument (m/z) shall be at least 4-300.
7. The instrument shall have a high vacuum system.  Under full gas load (i.e., during operation of the instrument), the vacuum shall range from &#8804;4 mbar in the expansion chamber to <210-8 mbar in the analyzer region.  The MC-ICPMS must have two vacuum valves to protect the high vacuum.  The vacuum system shall be fully interlocked and protected from user errors that might damage the systems, with automated sequencing for system start-up and shut down.  The computer shall be capable of monitoring the vacuum pressure in the interface, ion optics regions, and in the analyzer region of the instrument.
8. The software that controls the MC-ICPMS shall be modern, flexible, user-accessible, and easy-to-use.
9. The MC-ICPMS, and its peripherals, shall have a small footprint to adequately fit in the available laboratory space (approx. 140 sq. ft.).
10. The instrument shall have an inductively coupled plasma source that operates at a high ionization efficiency.
11. The MC-ICPMS shall have a configuration of Faraday collectors that allow the measurement of the isotopic systems from lithium to uranium.
12. The MC-ICPMS shall allow for a configuration of ion-counting detectors to enable the measurement of the short-lived U-series isotopes.
13. The instrument shall be compatible with the following third party accessories:  laser ablation systems, auto samplers, and other commonly used sample introduction devices (e.g., desolvating nebulizers or hydride-generation systems).
The USGS is in search of small business firms who are able to provide the above mentioned supply/service.  Small business firms who feel they can furnish the required supply/service or its functional equivalent (based on criteria specified herein) are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and such other materials, which correspond to the required supply/service stated herein.  This information will be used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, request for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. <br>  <br> THIS IS NOT A REOUEST FOR PROPOSALS. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. <br>  <br> USACE Norfolk District is seeking interested firms capable of performing design and construction of various dam safety repairs and upgrades for three dams located at Marine Corps Base (MCB) Quantico in Stafford and Prince William Counties, Virginia. The dam sites are located in the Training Area portion of MCB Quantico west of Interstate 95.  <br>  <br> DAM #1.  A high hazard earth-fill embankment dam constructed in 1956 <br>  <br>  The maximum height of the dam is 53 ft (measured from the downstream toe) and it has an approximate length of 1,300 ft (top of dam elevation).  Rip-rap ranging in size from 1 to 2 ft across covers the upstream face. The downstream face is covered with crushed stone.  A primary spillway is located near the right abutment and consists of a concrete Ogee weir and chute.  A 72-inch diameter reinforced concrete pipe conveys flow through the embankment. <br>  <br> Work includes modifying the existing earthen embankment in such a manner as to install a Roller-Compacted Concrete (RCC) armored Auxiliary Spillway.  It is expected that the embankment height at the location of the auxiliary spillway will be lowered and the embankment outside of the auxiliary spillway will be raised.  <br>  <br>   Installation of a filter drain system. <br>  <br>   Removal of a 54-inch blind flange. <br>  <br>   Replacement, of the following components may be required:  main sluice gated, self contained sluice gates, and dial position indicator on gate control pedestal, bottom stem guide bracket, trash screen, access deck and grating. <br>  <br>   Clearing sediment accumulated in front of main sluice gate intake (approx. 1 ft). <br>  <br>   Sealing of cracks and joints in ogee spillway. <br>  <br> DAM #2.  A concrete high-hazard, gravity dam constructed in the early 1940's <br>  <br> It is approximately 58 ft tall and 290 ft long (at top of dam elevation). Concrete corewalls are constructed into each abutment.  The spillway consists of a 110 ft long Ogee overflow section.  <br>  <br> Work includes modifying the existing abutment corewalls in such a manner as to prevent overtopping at the abutments during extreme flood events. The modified corewalls would prevent erosion of material directly downstream of the corewalls by redirecting flow away from the abutments. <br>  <br>   Installation of erosion protection. <br>  <br>   Installation of a filter drain system. <br>  <br>  Replacement, of the following components may be required:  sluice gate, control stems, stem guide and wall brackets, intake valves, and riser pipes. <br>  <br>   Replacement of riser pipes <br>  <br>   Demolition of trash bars and installation of a trash rack. <br>  <br>   Clear sediment accumulated in main sluice gate and clear discharge tunnel of debris and reinstall trash rack. <br>  <br>  DAM #3.  A low-hazard concrete gravity dam <br>  <br> It is approximately 250 ft long and though the maximum height shown on design drawings is approximately 10 ft, only about 5 ft of the dam is exposed above the downstream channel bed for most of its length. The original design drawings indicate a reservoir capacity of approximately 6 ac-ft.  However, as the reservoir is nearly filled with deposited sediments and vegetation material. <br>  <br>    Work includes dredging the reservoir in order to return it to its original capacity. Dredged material will be disposed off of Government property. <br>  <br> The target award of this construction is between $5,000,000.00 - $10,000,000.00.  All qualified firms are encouraged to respond by submitting Attachment A.  Upon review of the industry response to this Source Sought Notice, the Government should be able to complete acquisition strategy.  The estimated award date is Fall of 2013.  The NAICS Code 237990 will apply to the majority of this project.   <br>  <br> THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. It is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of qualified sources prior to finalizing the method of acquisition, best timing, and issuance of an award.  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis.  ALL interested contractors are encouraged to fill out the sources sought.   Submit 3 projects similar in scope and size to the project described above, with a contract value greater than $4,000,000.00 and completed within five years of date of this sources sought (Attachment A).   <br>  <br> If experience is by your major subcontractor, please submit your subcontractor's information along with the prime contractor's information.   <br>  <br> Please submit responses (preferable by email) no later than 10:00AM EST 26 March 2013 by fax 757-201-7183 (ATTN: Edward Walsh), via email: Edward.t.walsh@usace.army.mil (List W91236-13-R-0036 in the subject line of the email) or mail to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 803 Front Street, Norfolk, VA 23510. <br>  <br>

<DESC>The purpose of this service request for the Virology Division at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), Fort Detrick, MD is to expand on an identified multiple drugs and small molecules that inhibit alphavirus infection. The lead compounds identified will be further characterized  by two specific aims: 1) define the mechanism of action of the lead compounds and 2) define the potency of the detected anti-alphavirus activity by a yield reduction assay and a rapid in vivo screen in mice. To address both specific aims, this effort will utilize infectious cDNA virus clones that express fluorescent or bioluminescent markers of infection, which allow for rapid assessment of virus activity in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, virus-like replicon particles (VRPs) expressing a fluorescent protein will be used to determine initially infected cells. These studies will allow for further selection of promising candidate therapeutics that warrant additional investigation for efficacy in vivo.

<a href="mailto:william.a.creech3.civ@mail.mil">ACC-APG - RTP</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground RTP Division, on behalf of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL), is issuing a Program Announcement (PA), W911NF-13-R-0004, for the establishment of a Collaborative Research Alliance (CRA) for Cyber Security (CS). <br>  <br> Cyber security is critical to the Army due to the growing number and sophistication of attacks on military cyber networks coupled with the ever increasing reliance on cyber systems to conduct the Army's mission.  The Army Research Laboratory (ARL) has established an Enterprise approach to Cyber Security that couples multi-disciplinary internal research, analysis, and operations with extramural research and collaborative ventures.  ARL intends to establish a new collaborative venture - The Cyber Security Collaborative Research Alliance (CRA) - that seeks to advance the theoretical foundations of cyber science in the context of Army networks.   <br>  <br> This Collaborative Research Alliance will consist of academia, industry and government researchers working jointly to solve complex problems.  The overall objective of the Cyber Security CRA is to develop a fundamental understanding of cyber phenomena, including aspects of human attackers, cyber defenders, and end users, so that fundamental laws, theories, and theoretically grounded and empirically validated models can be applied to a broad range of Army domains, applications, and environments.   The ARL strongly believes that a joint collaborative approach by a multidisciplinary researcher team is required to make fundamental advances towards meeting the CRA goal to develop a fundamental understanding of cyber phenomena.   <br> ARL has identified three interrelated aspects or Research Areas of cyber security that when jointly studied will advance the theoretical foundations of cyber science in the context of Army networks.  In addition to these three Research Areas (RAs), advancing the theoretical foundations requires a trans-disciplinary approach that takes into account the human element of the network.  This Cross-Cutting Research Issue (CCRI) addressing Psychosocial Effects must be jointly studied in the context and the constraints of the three Research Areas.  The Research Areas and CCRI for this CRA are as follows: (1) Risk; (2) Detection; (3) Agility; (4) Psychosocial Effects. <br>  <br> The CS CRA PA can be found at www.arl.army.mil/cracyber. <br>  <br> This PA is expected to result in the award of a cooperative agreement (CA) as defined at 31 U.S.C. 6305 for the execution of the program.  The CA will be awarded to a Consortium of organizations that may include academic, industrial and non-profit organizations.  To assure the creation of a well-focused research program, the number of partners should balance the need for expertise in all three Research Areas and the crosscutting research initiative with the need to maintain a focused, cohesive, well-integrated research program.  The Consortium must be led by an academic institution charged with spearheading the focused basic research program.  Additionally, it is a goal that  quote mark covered educational institutions quote mark  (to include Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority-Serving Institutions) will receive 5% of the annual CA funding. <br>  <br> The consortium under this PA, will be selected via a two stage process involving Whitepapers and full proposals.  Full details regarding the application process are found in section D of the CS CRA PA.  Planned funding levels for the CA are set forth in the CS CRA PA.  Contingent upon available funding, the Army expects to support the CS CRA for five years with an option for an additional five years. <br>  <br> Whitepapers for the Cyber Security (CS) Collaborative Research Alliance (CRA) are due 26 April 2013.  Full proposals from invited Offerors are due 19 July 2013, with an award expected in September 2013. <br>  <br> Contracting Office Address: <br> ACC-APG RTP, ATTN: AMSSB-ACR, Research Triangle Park Division, P.O. 1221, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709-2211 <br>  <br> Additional Information: <br>  <br> http://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?page=8 <br> www.arl.army.mil/cracyber <br>  <br> Points of Contact(s): <br>  <br> William A.

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7920-00-NIB-0570<br />Name:		Broom, Sweeping, Rough Surface, 24" Block with 60" Handle and Brace<br />Description:	24 in. extra-rough surface push broom. Broom features 7/8 in. thick, solid hardwood block, 1-1/8 in. thick x 60 in. wood handle and 1/2 in. wide steel broom brace. Die cast connector eliminates loose handles. Stiff 4 in, extra long polyethylene fibers. Sweeps light gravel, nails, dirt and leaves. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		7920-00-NIB-0571<br />Name:		Broom, Sweeping, Medium Surface, 24" Block with 60" Handle and Brace<br />Description:	24 in. medium surface push broom. Broom features 7/8 in. thick, solid hardwood block, 1-1/8 in. thick x 60 in. wood handle and 1/2 in. wide steel broom brace. Die cast connector eliminates loose handles. Stiff polyethylene fibers are solvent resistant. Sweeps medium to rough surfaces. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		7920-00-NIB-0572<br />Name:		Broom, Sweeping, Smooth Surface, 24" Block with 60" Handle and Brace<br />Description:	24 in. smooth surface push broom. Broom features 7/8 in. thick, solid hardwood block, 1-1/8 in. thick x 60 in. wood handle and 1/2 in. wide steel broom brace. Die cast connector which eliminates loose handles. Soft polypropylene fibers with "split-tips" for fine sweeping. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, Fort Worth, TX.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>

<RESPDATE>032813
<CONTACT>Jeff Brown, Phone 2026933159, Email brown.jeffrey@dol.gov
<DESC>The Division of Contract Services (DCS), on behalf of the Department of Labor / Employment and Training Administration (ETA), intends to award a Sole Source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible Source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, to Aguirre Division of JBS International, Inc., 555 Airport Boulevard, Suite 400, Burlingame, CA 94010-2036 to administer ETA's National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS), a national random survey of the employment, demographic, and health characteristics of hired crop farm workers.<br /><br />The Federal Government has collected information on the demographic and employment characteristics of hired farm workers since the 1940s. Until 1987, the Hired Farm Workforce Survey, a December supplement to the Current Population Survey, was used to collect the information from agricultural employers. The U.S. Department of Agriculture summarized the information in hired farm worker profile reports. In 1988, and as a result of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), the DOL assumed responsibility for collecting this information.<br /><br />To comply with the IRCA mandate, which required annual estimates of the rate at which seasonal agricultural service workers exited the farm labor market, the DOL launched the NAWS, an establishment-based survey of hired crop farm workers. The NAWS questionnaire will be used to collect farm worker demographic, employment, and health information through in-person interviews with farm workers, over the contract period.<br /><br />The primary purpose of the NAWS has changed since the IRCA mandate and annual estimates of the rate at which farm workers leave agriculture are currently not required. As such, farm workers are interviewed only once per year and no attempts are made to locate the same respondent in ensuing interview periods. There are three data collection cycles each year. The start date for the fall, winter-spring, and summer cycle typically occurs between the first and fifteenth of October, February, and June, respectively. Each cycle lasts approximately three months. As such, interviews are conducted on a nearly year-round basis.<br /><br />Federal, state, and local government agencies, as well as private organizations utilize NAWS findings for a multitude of purposes, such as quantifying and assessing the human resources that are available to agriculture. The findings are also utilized in programs that aim to improve the well being of farm workers and their dependents. At the Federal level, these programs have included the National Farmworker Jobs Program (NFJP), Migrant and Seasonal Head Start, Migrant Education, and Migrant Health.<br /><br />Since 1988, the DOL has collaborated with several Federal agencies to increase the utility of the NAWS, including the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the Administration for Children and Families, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Collaboration with Federal agencies will continue over the contract period.<br />The contractor will be responsible for carrying out the NAWS and delivering a variety of NAWS-based research products on topics relevant to the ETA and other Federal agencies that administer migrant and seasonal farm worker and related programs. Activities undertaken in this project include, but are not limited to:<br />&bull; using Unemployment Insurance data and other information sources to develop a sampling frame of agricultural employers<br />&bull; using farm labor and agricultural production data from various sources to implement a multi-stratified probability-based sampling methodology,<br />&bull; developing and testing survey questions,<br />&bull; training interviewers to randomly select and interview between 1,500 and 3,000 farm workers per year,<br />&bull; developing and managing information for the construction of sampling and post-sampling weights, <br />&bull; managing, safeguarding, and analyzing data for the development and dissemination of research products, such as public-use and restricted-use datasets, reports, and on-line data tables, and <br />&bull; conducting appropriate statistical analysis and summarizing data in written, tabular, and graphic formats to complete deliverables <br /><br />The performance of the contract will involve access to confidential data, including data of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). These data are protected by law, including the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act. Protecting these data requires strong safeguards. In this particular situation, the ETA has decided within its discretion and in consultation with the BLS that all personnel who will handle the employer sampling frame data, which the BLS will provide directly to the Contractor, must be 1) direct-hire employees of the Contractor, and 2) agents of the BLS. As such, offerors who may be contemplating contracting portions of the work requirement that involve handling of sampling frame data, such as data collection, are hereby advised that further contracting for such purposes will not be permitted. Restricting the further contracting of tasks that involve handling the confidential data is necessary, after taking into account the safeguards needed to protect the data and the need for administrative convenience in implementing these safeguards.
<p>This action will result in a&nbsp;Time and Material type&nbsp;contract with a twelve (12) month period of performance and four (4) additional 12-month option periods. This notice of intent to award a Sole Source contract is not a request for competitive proposals. There is no solicitation document. No RFP will be available for competitive proposals. Phone calls will not be accepted. The anticipated award date is March 28, 2012.</p>

<DESC>This synopsis is hereby issued in accordance with FAR Part 5.203 and FAR Part 17.207 in response to the mandatory requirement for a 15 day notification. The purpose of this synopsis is to announce the Food and Drug Administration's intent to exercise an option to Leland Junior Stanford University to procure continued research and development services for a study titled, "Cross-Species Immune System Reference." The contract was solicited and awarded through Broad Agency Announcement No. FDABAA-12-00118. <br />
<p>The objective of the proposed work to be conducted is to use mass cytometry to map immune responses in an expanded number of human and animal samples that result from various stimuli (including biological threat agents and candidate medical countermeasures). The expanded project will also include the comparison of samples collected from animals infected with biological threat agents to previously described work conducted with samples from uninfected animals, as well as studies performed with inactivated biological threat agents. As with the work performed in the base period, the human and animal responses will be compared and the resulting data will be made available to the community through an open-access resource.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that this work will enhance the understanding of the diversity of immune responses elicited by these stimuli both within and across species. Specifically, the project provides a potential means to better understand the mechanism(s) of toxicity of biological threat agents, identify off-target effects of candidate medical countermeasures, the mechanism(s) of action for candidate medical countermeasures, and the comparability of these effects between animals and humans. The incorporation of studies with biothreat agents may also provide new insight into pathogenesis and identification of biomarkers. <br /><br />Any questions regarding this synopsis should be directed to Sean Wybenga, Contract Specialist, via email at Sean.Wybenga@hhs.fda.gov.</p>

<SUBJECT>Special Program Announcement for 2013 Office of Naval Research Research Opportunity:  Development of Noise Prediction Design Tools for Future Multi-Stream, Low-Noise Tactical Aircraft (TACAIR) Engine Exhausts
<SOLNBR>13-SN-0011
<RESPDATE>041213
<CONTACT>Frank Kennedy, Contract Specialist, Email kennedf@onr.navy.mil - Dr. Joseph Doychak, Project Officer, Email joseph.doychak@navy.mil
<DESC>Noise generated by TACAIR engines is an acute noise source and is a concern of the Department of the Navy. Historically, TACAIR engine performance requirements have increased without accompanying noise-reduction requirements, a trend which has resulted in increased noise challenges for the Navy. An understanding of the trades between performance and noise requires data acquired at relevant jet conditions using nozzle geometries of interest. The ability to effectively utilize the knowledge gained requires engineering design tools for noise-prediction validated with relevant acoustic datasets. The program will pursue the acquisition of acoustic data and development of engineering design noise-prediction tools/models for potential future tactical aircraft engine/nozzle architectures.
<p>The Office of Naval Research is seeking proposals that address both (1) the acquisition of noise data for multi-stream, hot, supersonic jets issuing from relevant, complex nozzle geometries and (2) the development and validation (using noise data acquired in (1)) of engineering design models/tools for noise prediction that could be used in future tactical aircraft system studies. The datasets and prediction models should address noise levels for relevant jet conditions at locations on the carrier deck and in the far-field where community noise is an issue. The nozzle geometries of interest are those that accommodate two-and three-stream engine/nozzle architectures including round co-annular and non-co-annular nozzles as well as non-round, vehicle-integrated nozzle configurations. The studies are not intended to include propulsion-airframe interactions. Relevant jet conditions include representative carrier-deck takeoff conditions and an appropriate range of engine cycle conditions expected for operations around airbases. The engineering design tools/models should be computationally efficient and intended for use in system trade studies where a large number of configurations must be evaluated.</p>

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

In reference to CLIN 0004 - "Taxes, Fees and Surcharges" (TFS), Offeror(s) must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable TFS. Enter only the amount that is documented as applicable and allowable. Inclusion of any amount that is not documented may render the proposal non-responsive. Provide a separate delineation or breakdown of all applicable TFS.</p>
<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services.<br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>Subfactor 3 - Enhanced 911 Service. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.

The Government reserves the right to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Offers shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2 - Evaluation - Commercial Items - The addendum to paragraph (a) is as follows: The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  <br> 1-	Price: Price will be evaluated for fair and reasonableness and for unbalanced pricing.  <br> 2-	Past Performance: This factor will be rated acceptable or unacceptable based on whether the past performance submitted for consideration is relevant and demonstrates successful past performance by the vendor, such as: no terminations for default, no ratings less than satisfactory by its customers/references, whether the quality of its work was satisfactory and completed in a timely manner and whether  the vendor demonstrated reasonableness and cooperation during performance of the contracts. Past failure to apply sufficient tenacity and perseverance to perform acceptably is strong evidence of unacceptable past performance. In addition, failure to meet the quality requirements of a contract is a significant factor to consider in determining unsatisfactory performance. <br> Past Performance Evaluation Ratings: <br> Acceptable- Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the vendor will successfully perform the required effort, or the vendor's performance is unknown.  <br> Unacceptable- Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the vendor will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br> For Past Performance to be considered relevant, it must be similar in work, as described in Para. 1.6 of the attached Performance Work Statement, must be completed in the last five years from the date of this solicitation and the magnitude must be over $25,000.00(Euro 18,102.50).In the case of a quote without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the vendor shall be determined to have unknown past performance. Unknown shall be considered acceptable. The Past Performance is considered to be not relevant if it is not similar in work, as described in Para. 1.6 of the attached Performance Work Statement,  if it is not completed in the last five years from the date of this solicitation and if the magnitude is under $25,000.00 (Euro 18,102.50).The Government will conduct a past performance assessment on all contracts submitted by the vendor on the attached Past Performance Questionnaire. The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in contractor's performance.  Offerors must submit three completed forms at Attachment II  titled  quote mark Past Performance Questionnaire quote mark  (in English). The Government will consider the Past Performance information, as well as information obtained from any other sources. <br> FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition; FAR 52.214-34 - Submission of Offers in the English Language; FAR 52.217-8 - Option to Extend Services; FAR 52.225-14 - Inconsistency Between English Version and Translation of Contract; FAR 52.225-17 - Evaluation of Foreign Currency Offers; FAR 52.222-50 Combat Trafficking in Persons; FAR 52.233-1 Disputes; FAR 52.233-3 Protest After Award; FAR 52.238-3 Workers Compensation Insurance; FAR 52.252-1 - Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference; FAR 52.252-2 - Clauses Incorporated by Reference; FAR 52.232-8- Discounts for Prompt Payment; FAR 52.237-2 Protection of Government Buildings, Equipment, and Vegetation; FAR 52.242-15 - Stop-Work Order; DFARS 252.201-7000 Contracting Officer's Representative; DFARS 252.222-7002 Compliance with Local Labor Laws (Overseas); DFARS 252.222-7003 Permit from Italian Inspectorate of Labor; DFARS 252.223-7006 Prohibition on Storage and Disposal of Toxic and Hazardous Materials; DFARS 252.225-7041 Correspondence in English; DFARS 252.225-7042 Authorization to Perform; DFARS 252.225-7043 Antiterrorism/Force Protection for Defense Contractors Outside the United States; DFARS 252.229-7000 Invoices Exclusive of Taxes or Duties; DFARS 252.229-7001 Tax Relief; DFARS 252.229-7003 Tax Exemptions (Italy); DFARS 252.232-7008 Assignment of Claims (Overseas).CCE 204-4000 U.S. and Host nation holidays; CCE 225-4001 Installation clearance requirements; CCE 233-4001 Choice of law-Overseas (Italy); CCE 233-4002 AMC - Level protest program; CCE 237-4000 Contractor Identification requirement. <br>  <br>  The following FAR Clauses under this clause are checked and are applicable to this acquisition: F.O.B.

Award will be made to a single Offeror who is determined responsive and responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and whose proposal is the lowest priced offer conforming to the solicitation requirements and determined to meet or exceed the acceptability standards for not just cost factors, judged by an overall assessment of the evaluation criteria and other consideration specified in the solicitation, represents the Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable offer.  The Proposal selected for award, will be the proposal that is determined more advantageous to the Government.  This is a best value source selection and will be conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.3, Source Selection, as supplemented by the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), and the Army Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFARS).  The Government will evaluate proposed prices for fairness and reasonableness using price analysis techniques. <br>  <br> As set forth in FAR 52.215-1 (f)(4), the Government intends to evaluate each factor and award a contract without discussions (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a),  quote mark Clarifications and award without discussions quote mark ).  Therefore, the Offeror's initial proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> EVALUATION CRITERIA <br>  <br> FAR  52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items JAN 1999 <br> (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the 	responsible Offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br> (i) Technical capability with sub-factors Staffing Plan, Personnel Qualification, and Management Approach. <br> (ii) Past Performance <br> (iii) Price <br>  <br> (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).   <br>  <br> (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br> 					(End of Provision) <br>  <br> EVALUATION APPROACH: <br>  <br> STEP 1 - Based on the information provided pursuant to the instructions for proposal content above, the Government will evaluate the proposals for Technical Capability sub-factors, assigning ratings of Acceptable or Unacceptable.  The Technical Capability evaluation provides an assessment of the Offeror's technical capability to satisfy Government requirements.  An Offeror must be considered technically acceptable in  both sub-factors to be deemed overall acceptable on the Technical Capability Factor.  Any sub-factor that receives an unacceptable rating will result in an overall unacceptable rating for the Technical Capability Factor and will render the Offeror ineligible for award. <br>  <br> Sub-Factor 1 - Staffing Plan:  In order to be considered acceptable, the Offeror must - through submission of the required information - thoroughly demonstrate an effective plan to provide qualified personnel when and where required.   <br>  <br>  Sub-Factor 2 - Management Approach: In order to be considered acceptable, the Offeror must - through submission of the required information - thoroughly demonstrate the ability to successfully execute the managerial requirements of the performance work statement. <br>  <br> Adjectival Ratings:  Each Technical Capability Subfactor will receive one of the adjectival ratings defined below and then there will be an overall roll-up adjectival rating at the factor level.   <br>  <br> ACCEPTABLE: Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation. <br>  <br> UNACCEPTABLE:  Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation. <br>  <br> Only those proposals found to be acceptable for Technical Capability will be eligible for evaluation on the other factors.  Proposals found to be unacceptable for Technical Capability will not be eligible for award.  The establishment of ratings for the Technical Capability Factor does not constitute the establishment of a competitive range pursuant to FAR 15.306c. <br>  <br> STEP 2 - Based on the information provided pursuant to the instructions for proposal content above, Offeror must thoroughly demonstrate, by way of their past performance, their likelihood of successfully performing the solicitation's requirements.  Offerors are cautioned that in conducting the performance risk assessment, the Government may use data provided in the Offeror's proposal and data obtained from other sources, such as the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), Federal Award Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) or similar systems and State Department Watch Lists.  In assessing past performance, the Government will assess the Offeror's overall past performance, and will examine how well the Offeror performed in the following areas:  <br>  <br> 		(a)  Quality Control (QC) <br> 		(b)  Timely Performance <br> 		(c)  Customer Satisfaction <br>  <br> The past performance information provided in the proposal and information obtained from other sources will be used to establish the quality of the past performance.   <br>  <br> Adjectival Ratings:  Evaluation of the Past Performance Factor will result in the Factor being rated with one of the adjectival ratings defined below: <br>  <br> ACCEPTABLE: Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the Offeror's performance record is unknown.  <br>  <br> UNACCEPTABLE:  Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br>  <br> Only those proposals found to be acceptable for Technical Capability and Past Performance will be eligible for evaluation on final factor, Price.  Proposals found to be unacceptable for Technical Capability and/or Past Performance will not be eligible for award.   <br>  <br> STEP 3 - For those proposals found acceptable in both Technical Capability and Past Performance, the Government will perform price analysis pursuant to FAR Part 15.404-1(b).  To be considered for award, the proposed price must be determined fair & reasonable. <br>  <br>  <br> INVOICING AND PAYMENTS:  All contractor invoices and receiving reports are required to be submitted electronically in accordance with DFARS 252.232-7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports. Contractors shall submit invoices through the Wide Area Work Flow System (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil/. <br>  <br> The Government will be using WAWF to accept/approve invoices and receiving reports. Payment will not be made unless and until both the contractor and the Government WAWF submissions are submitted and processed correctly. Contractor invoices must reflect the contract line item numbers (CLINs) contained in the contract. Proper invoices also must reflect the prices stipulated in the contract and the service or supply must be delivered, inspected and accepted. <br>  <br>  An interactive self-paced training module is available for both contractor and Government personnel at http://wawftraining.com to learn how to use WAWF. WAWF also offers customer support and/or assistance at 1-866-618-5988. <br>  <br> The following codes will be required to route receiving reports and invoices correctly through WAWF. <br>  <br> CONTRACT NUMBER:  TBD  <br> TYPE OF DOCUMENT:  TBD <br> COMBO CAGE CODE:  TBD <br> ISSUE BY DODAAC:  TBD <br> ADMIN DODAAC:  TBD <br> INSPECT BY DODAAC:  TBD <br> SERVICE ACCEPTOR:  TBD <br> LOCAL PROCESSING OFFICE:  HQ0490 <br> PAY OFFICE DODAAC:  TBD <br>  <br> LOCAL CLAUSE 5152.233-4000, AMC-Level Protest Program (Nov 2008) <br> If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HA, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. <br> 	 <br> 	Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command <br> 	Office of Command Counsel <br> 	4400 Martin Road <br> 	Rm: A6SE040.001 <br> 	Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 <br> 	Fax: (256) 450-8840 <br> 	The AMC-Level Protest procedures are found at: <br> 	http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/COMMANDCOUNSEL.asp <br>  <br> Point of Contact:  SSG Ametrius S Shaw; 706-545-7756 or 706-545-5428; <br> Usarmy.benning.hqda-aca.mbx.doc-offer@mail.mil <br>  <br>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to?

      (B)  Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and
      (C)  Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. 
    (ii)  If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. 
   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>Insert a clause substantially similar to 1352.246?70, Place of Acceptance, in contracts and solicitations to indicate where the acceptance of supplies and/or services will take place.

(d)  Offerors should note that a review of the Contracting Officer?s decision will not extend GAO?s timeliness requirements.  Therefore, any subsequent protest to GAO must be filed within 10 days of knowledge of initial adverse agency action. <BR> <BR>USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM ? STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (1)   The offeror?s past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System ? Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier?s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier?s past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier?s overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
1.  Dark Blue:Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group* 2.  Purple:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 3.  Green:Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group* 4.  Yellow:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 5.  Red:Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier?s percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating. <BR> <BR>Due to the interrelationship of supplies and/or services to be provided hereunder, the Government reserves the right to make a single award to the offeror whose offer is considered in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered.  Therefore, offerors proposing less than the entire effort specified herein may be determined to be unacceptable. <BR> <BR>1)   Award under this procurement will be made to the technically acceptable quote/offer which is most advantageous to the Government, price and past performance considered.
2)   Technically Acceptable - In order to be determined technically acceptable, offers must meet or exceed the specifications, delivery requirements, and other terms and conditions in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  If applicable, offers must also meet the requirements of FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal.   The offer must be determined to be technically acceptable before further consideration.
3)   Price - Evaluation of price will include the following:
(  )Single Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled "Single Award for All Items". (  )Split Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled ?Evaluation of Offers for Split Awards?. (  )Transportation costs per FAR 52.247-__@@___. (  )Evaluation of Options per FAR 52.217-__@@__.
4)   Past Performance - Evaluation of past performance will be based on information obtained from PPIRS-SR as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  A quote/offer with a low PPIRS-SR rating (red or yellow for quality and/or less than a 70 weighted delivery score) may not represent the most advantageous quote/offer to the Government. <BR> <BR>F.O.B.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
<p>United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>(b) Definitions.

A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)-</p>
<p>(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;<br />(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-<br />(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or<br />(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and</p>
<p>(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated</p>
<p>group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.<br />(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.</p>
<p>(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:<br />(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or<br />(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).</p>
<p>(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.</p>
<p>(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.</p>

<p>(i) warrants;<br />(ii) options;<br />(iii) contracts to acquire stock;<br />(iv) convertible debt instruments; and<br />(v) others similar interests.</p>
<p>(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>7.  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. personal services contracts (USPSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.  USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 13 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/promoting-peaceful-political-transitions</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

The following provisions and clauses are applicable to this procurement: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items. The Government reserves the right to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Offers shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2 - Evaluation - Commercial Items - The addendum to paragraph (a) is as follows: The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:   <br>  1-	Price: Price will be evaluated for fair and reasonableness and for unbalanced pricing.   <br>  2-	Past Performance: This factor will be rated acceptable or unacceptable based on whether the past performance submitted for consideration is relevant and demonstrates successful past performance by the vendor, such as: no terminations for default, no ratings less than satisfactory by its customers/references, whether the quality of its work was satisfactory and completed in a timely manner and whether  the vendor demonstrated reasonableness and cooperation during performance of the contracts. Past failure to apply sufficient tenacity and perseverance to perform acceptably is strong evidence of unacceptable past performance. In addition, failure to meet the quality requirements of a contract is a significant factor to consider in determining unsatisfactory performance.  <br>  Past Performance Evaluation Ratings:  <br>  Acceptable- Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the vendor will successfully perform the required effort, or the vendor's performance is unknown.   <br>  Unacceptable- Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the vendor will be able to successfully perform the required effort.  <br>  For Past Performance to be considered relevant, it must be similar in work, as described in Para. 1.6 of the attached Performance Work Statement, must be completed in the last five years from the date of this solicitation and the magnitude must be over $25,000.00(Euro 18,102.50).In the case of a quote without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the vendor shall be determined to have unknown past performance. Unknown shall be considered acceptable. The Past Performance is considered to be not relevant if it is not similar in work, as described in Para. 1.6 of the attached Performance Work Statement,  if it is not completed in the last five years from the date of this solicitation and if the magnitude is under $25,000.00 (Euro 18,102.50).The Government will conduct a past performance assessment on all contracts submitted by the vendor on the attached Past Performance Questionnaire. The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in contractor's performance.  Offerors must submit three completed forms at Attachment II  titled  quote mark Past Performance Questionnaire quote mark  (in English).

The HQAMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an alternative dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. These procedures apply to the HQAMC-Level Protest Program only. <BR> <BR>?	Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. 
Federal Government employees, unions or installations are not considered interested parties for the purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. 
Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to incorporate the following supplemental information in paragraph one of the section titled, Full Proposals of Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Number DTFH61-13-R-00008:
<p>The capabilities for the persistence library are as follows:<br /><br />1. Import TNM 2.5 inputs in xml format as created from the TNM 2.5 to 3.0 converter within the TNM 3.0 Beta. <br />2. Open and save TNM 3.0 cases in xml format, which will include all inputs to the model, and sound level results for only specific designs: the default barrier designs ("All Mitigation Barriers at Zero Height" and "All Barriers at Input Height") and all remembered user-defined barrier designs.</p>
<p>In order to support the same barrier design process as supported in TNM 2.5, the BAA respondents would need to develop means to save partial results. Offerors can obtain better understanding of this by reading the source code.<br />_________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>In addition to the above, this amendment is also to provide FHWA's response to the following&nbsp;question regarding the BAA:</p>
<p>Question 1) Does FHWA want the&nbsp;offerors to implement acoustic calc code? For example, does FHWA require:</p>
<p>1- acoustic calculation code plus a GUI front-end (includes all other input/output and more features, as listed in BAA, page 4), or<br />2- only the GUI front-end code, where the acoustic code comes from Volpe/FHWA (for example by a DLL)</p>
<p>FHWA's response: The first sentence within the "Description and Objectives" (top of page 3) states "The FHWA is soliciting proposals to interface the FHWA Traffic Noise Model (TNM) version 3.0 acoustics library within a graphic user interface (GUI) such as...". As such, FHWA expects any submission to take the FHWA acoustic library, also referred to as&nbsp;the "source code", and implement (or, interface) it with a GUI to accomplish at least the items listed on page 4 of the BAA. FHWA will have sole ownership of the acoustical code, and any changes from the acoustical code will come from the FHWA.<br /><br />This&nbsp;BAA is amended accordingly.</p>

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor?s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via CCR accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (Feb 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). ___Alternate I (Aug 2007) of 52.222-50 (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)).

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING MODEL MAKER - 3D PRINTER.  The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions received by interested vendors. Question 1: What types of models do you plan to make? Answer 1: We plan to make scale models and functional parts. Question 2: Do you require "Durable Models"? Answer 2: Yes. Question 3: Do you require functional models? Answer 3: Yes. Question 4: Do you currently utilize any 3D printers? Answer 4: Yes Question 5: Why do you need Photo Cured models? Answer 5: We have found that we need a machine capable of producing fine detail parts that are only possible with a photo cured material that is also reasonably priced. Additionally, we also need these parts to  have anisotropic material properties with a smooth finish that is also only possible with photo cured materials. Question 6: What printers are currently in use today? Answer 6: We have a Stratasys FDM machine and several other types of machines utilized by others at JSC. Question 7: Do paragraphs(k)(1) or (k)(2) of provision 52.212-3 (FAR) apply to this solicitation? Answer 7: As this is a commercial supply purchase, the Service Contract Act is not applicable.  Because the SCA is not applicable, that specific certification is not required. So, neither box should be checked. The due date for receipt of offers is not extended. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on March 8, 2013. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Services include subsurface borings for the installation of 2-inch diameter PVC piezometers with five-foot long screens.    <br>    The Lake Washington Ship Canal project provides a connective waterway between Puget Sound and Lake Washington through Lake Union.  The Hiram M. Chittenden Locks (Locks) part of the project consists of a small and large lock, a concrete gravity dam and spillway, saltwater drain, guide walls, and fish ladder.  The fish ladder and locks also provide fish passage past the lock and dam structure.  Downstream of the locks, the project consists of a channel 34 feet deep and 300 feet wide from Puget Sound to the Burlington Northern Railway Bridge.  The locks and dam were constructed between 1916 through 1923.  The fish ladder was rehabilitated with a new public viewing center and restrooms added in 1976-77.  The project is a major element in Seattle's economy and provides transit to 80,000 vessels per year.  The project is also a popular tourist attraction, receiving approximately one million visitors per year.    <br>

<p>Organizational Conflict of Interest:</p>
<p>Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) as defined and discussed in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest, is a concern in all acquisitions across the Department of Defense. Early involvement with our industry partners is a key element of the OCI process, and it is critical for the Government to be able to identify any potential OCI issues as early as possible for an acquisition. This would allow ample time to address and evaluate any potential OCI issues, if required, prior to contract award with minimal impact to critical acquisition schedules. Additional information about potential OCI issues is provided in a link that can be found at FedBizOpps website located at http://www.fbo.gov</p>
<p>Interested vendors are requested to evaluate your potential OCI issues with regard to this requirement for the required services, and the Vendor is encouraged to identify any OCI issues, as stated in FAR Subpart 9.5 to the Contracting Officer (CO). This will assist the CO in determining if the vendor will need to submit an OCI Mitigation Plan for any solicitation that might result from this notice.</p>
<p>Due Date for Responses:</p>
<p>Capability package responses are due not later than 12:00 P.M.

Anticipated type of contract is firm fixed price. Basic Ordering Agreement mistakenly identified in original solicitation.
--------------------------------------------- The following questions were submitted: Q1: What happens if construction on the Ely warehouse is delayed and delivery cannot occur aug 19-23? A1:  The warehouse project is currently ahead of schedule and should be substantially complete in time for delivery.  If it is not, then we would either a) Mod the contracts and have seed delivered to Boise Seed Warehouse with a potential price increase due to further delivery or b) Mod the contract for later delivery.
Q2:If seed is awarded for Ely, when can we invoice for that seed? A2: Invoice on delivery of seed.  No seed will be paid for that has not been received and tested.
Q3: If seed is awarded to Ely, when do we sample/test it? A3: On award
Q4:Can I change column B to offer uncertified seed when you are asking for certified seed? A4: No. If you want to offer something other than what is being requested, list it under the 10 additional species.
Q5: When does the clock start for pre-qualified seed? A5: Award date. ------------------------------------------------------

PLEASE READ ALL DOCUMENTS CAREFULLY Per the attached spreadsheet, the BLM requires multiple quantities and species of seed delivered to multiple locations. Multiple awards are anticipated. The NAICS Code for this solicitation is 111998 with a size standard of $0.75 million/500 employees. PLEASE READ ALL DOCUMENTS CAREFULLY.

<DESC>Amendment 2 to DARPA-BAA-12-09<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of this amendment is to extend the due date for receipt of proposals and make an administrative change:</p>
<p>1. The due date for receipt of proposals under DARPA-BAA-12-09 is extended from March 31, 2013 to May 31, 2013.</p>
<p>2.  The first paragraph of Section 3.1.1, Procurement Integrity, Standards of Conduct, Ethical Considerations, and Organizational Conflicts of Interest, is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:</p>
<p>"Current federal employees are prohibited from participating in particular matters involving conflicting financial, employment, and representational interests (18 USC 203, 205, and 208).  Prior to the start of proposal evaluations, the Government will assess potential conflicts of interest and will promptly notify the proposer if any appear to exist. (Please note the Government assessment does NOT affect, offset, or mitigate the proposer's own duty to give full notice and planned mitigation for all potential organizational conflicts, as discussed below.)"</p>

<DESC><p>Pre-Solicitation Notice<br /><br />PR Number: IQC12318009006 Various Commercial Fasteners<br /><br />The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is transforming the way it orders, receives, accounts for, and distributes commercial fasteners in FSC 5305, 5306, 5307, 5310, 5320, 5330, 5331, 5340, 5355, and 5360, for its customers. The intended award shall be a Commercial Fastener Tailored Logistics Support (TLS) Program contract. In order to transform these functions, DLA will need an integrated supply solution strategy that relies on a level of contractor support that includes forecasting collaboration with customers, total supply chain management, distribution/warehousing, quality control, customer direct support, compliance with Time Definite Delivery (TDD) timeframes, data management, and achieving a minimum material availability of 90% at the start of the contract progressing to the minimum acceptable level of 95% in year 4.<br /><br />There are approximately 6000 items listed on the Price Evaluation List of items (formerly identified as the Core List of items) that will be evaluated and awarded under this solicitation. Offerors must submit offers on at least 90% of the Price Evaluation List items to be considered for award on any Price Evaluation List of items. Each item will be evaluated and awarded utilizing Best-value, Tradeoff Source Selection Procedures. Offers submitted on an "all or none" basis will not be considered for award. The Government will make one award to the responsible offeror, whose offer meets or exceeds the terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation, and whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government considering price and past performance. Past performance is significantly more important than cost or price. In addition, the Government has identified approximately 199,636 additional items that may be added to the resultant contract on a post award basis via the Add/Delete Clause. The contract maximum dollar value is $84,064,538.09.<br /><br />In accordance with FAR 19.102 (f)(5) this acquisition is being solicited as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside with a Waiver of the Non-Manufacturer Rule. The Non-Manufacturer Rule requires that the actual manufacturer or processor be a small business concern. This applies to all items that are fully competitive or for which a domestic small business manufacturer or processor exists. Thus, the Waiver of the Non-Manufacturer Rule applies only to those items where no known domestic small business manufacturers or processors can reasonably be expected to offer a product meeting the requirements of the solicitation. <br /><br />This solicitation requests offers on a customer direct basis only. Pricing for all items must be FOB Destination, with the exception of Foreign Military Sales (FMS) items requiring FOB Origin and Inspection/Acceptance Origin. <br />Delivery is for customer direct support in compliance with TDD timeframes. TDD according to Issue Priority Group (IPG) is as follows:<br /><br />IPG I = Requisition Priority 1, 2 or 3<br />IPG II = Requisition Priority 4 - 8<br />IPG III = Requisition Priority 9 - 15<br /><br />Delivery = IPG I - 2 days<br />IPG II - 5 days<br />IPG III - 12 days</p>
<p>This solicitation will contain Surge and Sustainment (S&amp;S) requirements. <br /><br />Buy American Act Certification applies.<br /><br />There are items contained in the solicitation that have the Qualified Supplier List (QSL) requirement. Only manufacturers/suppliers on the QSLM/QSLD will be eligible for an award pursuant to this solicitation. Note: The dealer (if applicable) and the manufacturer will need to be QSL certified at time of award. Therefore, inspection and acceptance on QSL items will be at destination. However, the Government reserves the right to Source Inspect any item.<br /><br />Material Pricing: Fixed material prices are established and are subject to an Economic Price Adjustment (EPA) pursuant to Clause 52.216-9030. Offerors are required to furnish pricing fixed material prices, on at least 90% of the line items in the price evaluation list, which will be subject to an Economic Price Adjustment (EPA) pursuant to Caluse 52.216-9030. The government guarantees that the successful contractor will receive, at a minimum, compensation equal to 10% of the estimated three year base dollar value of the contract excluding incentives and disincentives.<br /><br />Services Fees: These fees are only incurred to receive or issue the inventory transferred from DLA. Fixed Pricing is established for the level of performance to support demands over a 5-year ordering period, to include a 3-year base ordering period, and one (1) 2-year option period. All service fees will be paid out against the referenced additive CLIN. Service fees are priced as follows: <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Transition Fee:</span> The contractor will be reimbursed for receiving and storing material transitioned from DLA's inventory. A flat cost per receipt will be established to cover the costs to receipt and stow DLA inventory transitioned to the contractor's plant. The total amount will vary with the number of shipments of Government-owned material made from the Depot to the Contractor. The fee is applicable throughout the entire contract. Contractor will bill monthly for receipts processed. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Material Release Order (MRO) Throughput Fee:</span> The contractor will be reimbursed for issuing material from the inventory transitioned from DLA and shipping to the DLA customer. A flat cost per order shipped will be established to cover the costs to receive the Material Release Order from DLA, pull DLA material from contractor's shelves, and package and ship (including transportation) the DLA material to the customer. The total amount will depend on the amount of inventory transitioned from DLA to the contractor, and customer orders. The fee is applicable throughout the entire contract. Contractor will bill monthly for orders shipped. <br /><br />Contractor performance will be governed by Fill Rate Metrics. Performance will be evaluated at the end of each performance period to determine compliance with the metrics and to compute the amount of incentive/disincentive the contractor earned for that performance period. This will be detailed in the Statement of Work (SOW) in the solicitation. <br /><br />The contract awarded as a result of this solicitation will be an Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) with a base period of 3 years and 1 two-year option period. An Economic Price Adjustment (EPA) will apply to the option period in accordance with DLAD 52.216-9030 set forth in the solicitation. <br />The solicitation is scheduled to issue on March 14, 2013. The date is subject to change. A copy of the solicitation and all attachments including, but not limited to, the item description pages, pricing spreadsheet, surge and sustainment NSN requirements, historical 5-year demand data, wholesale inventory level at warehouses, and the universe of items will be available via DLA Internet Bid Board System (DIBBS) as well as the following website:<br />http://www.troopsupport.dla.mil/Hardware.</p>
<p>All responsible sources will be able to submit a proposal which will be considered by DLA Troop Support. For additional information, please email a request to Kellie.Farrell@dla.mil or Lisa.Samocki@dla.mil. This is NOT a Request for Proposal, Request for Quotation, or Invitation for Bid. The Government is in no way obligated to purchase any material as a result of this notice.</p>

<DESC>This procurement is an Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) opportunity at the Naval Submarine Base New London (NSBNL), Groton, Connecticut.  The proposed site is comprised of paved and unimproved area totaling approximately 4.34 acres.  The site available for lease is located at the southeast ("SE") corner of NSBNL at the intersection of Crystal Lake Road and Route 12.  NSBNL is on the east bank of the Thames River, partially located in both, the Town of Groton, Connecticut and the Town of Ledyard, Connecticut, approximately 55 miles from Providence, RI, 50 miles from New Haven, CT, and 55 miles from Hartford, CT.  The EUL site is located within the fence line of NSBNL, which is a closed base, not open to the general public.  Ingress and egress to the site could potentially be obtained from public roads Route 12 or Crystal Lake Road by repositioning the existing security fence.
Procurement Process:
The Navy is seeking a lessee to establish, operate and maintain a retail/recreational development that will enhance the quality of life for Navy personnel and the surrounding community and serve as the primary economic driver of the site in exchange for in-kind-consideration not less than the fair market value of the leasehold interest in the real property.
The Government intends to award the EUL using a two-phased, best value source selection process.  Specific source selection procedures, submission requirements, evaluation criteria, and the obligations and responsibilities of the successful Offeror are identified in the Request for Qualifications (RFQ) N40085-09-RP-00018
RFQ N40085-09-RP-00018:  The RFQ is issued as an attachment to this Announcement.  The RFQ is also available at http://www.navyeul.com/projects/new_london_corner/docs.php.  While the Navy intends to enter into a Lease with an Offeror selected through the process set forth in the RFQ, the Navy is under no obligation to do so.  The Navy reserves the right to cancel this RFQ at any time or to reject any and all submissions prepared in response to the RFQ.  The RFQ does not commit the Government to contract for services, or to pay any costs incurred in preparation of any submission in response to the RFQ. 
All questions, clarification requests, and general information requests regarding the RFQ must be submitted, in writing, to Ms. Heather McGee, Realty Specialist, Asset Management, Attn: Code OPNEAM1-HM, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Mid-Atlantic, 9742 Maryland Ave., Norfolk, VA 23511-3095, or via email to heather.mcgee@navy.mil .

<DESC>Tricare Management Activity intends to negotiate a firm fixed-price contract with American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP), 7272 Wisconsin Ave, Bethesda, MD 20814-1439.on a sole source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement. The acquisition will be accomplished using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13 to purchase accreditation fees for the purpose of maintaining accreditation of the Pharmacy Residency Programs within Pharmaceutical Operations Directorate (Pharm-OPS). The accreditation fee covers all of the oversight requirements including site visits for the accreditation, reference materials and resources, online evaluation software which is a critical need for the program to operate, resident matching services through the National Matching Service, and an online application system.
<p>The ASHP is a professional membership organization that is responsible for accrediting pharmacy residencies and pharmacy technician training programs for the pharmacy profession. ASHP is the only nationally recognized non-governmental, non-profit pharmacy association that has been accrediting pharmacy residencies since 1962. Accreditation is the process whereby a program providing education and training is reviewed against quality standards that fulfills the requirements designated by the accreditation agency. ASHP accreditation is now required by several state Boards of Pharmacy. Pharm-OPS must maintain their accreditation from ASHP for Pharm-OPS pharmacy residency programs that are postgraduate training for pharmacists. There are only two specialized/programmatic accreditors that review pharmacy education programs; The Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE), American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP). The ASHP is the only nationally recognized pharmacy association that has the capability to accredit pharmacy residencies that are postgraduate training programs for pharmacists. <br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 813910 and the size standard is $7.0 million. Any firm that wishes to identify their interests and capability to provide this service must provide proof of accreditation in Pharmacy Residency in the United States no later than 12:00 PM EST, March 18, 2013. <br />Such notification must include any documentation that includes certifications in the United States. Notifications shall be mailed or emailed to Jamie Karpierz, Contract Specialist, Jamie. Karpierz@tma.osd.mil (703) 681-7226</p>
