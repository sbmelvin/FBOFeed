<DESC>The Communications and Information Agency of Uzbekistan invites submission of Proposals from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct a feasibility study to examine modernizing Uzbekistan's postal facilities using Internet and IT technology.

The proposed Postal Modernization project is intended to facilitate the provision of postal and financial services and thoroughly modernize Uzbekistan's existing postal facilities.  It is anticipated that banking services would be provided by the Uzbek Communications Bank, which would obtain all necessary new banking licenses.  In addition, the Project envisages the installation of Internet facilities for the public's use, at nominal charge, at over 3,300 post office locations.

During the proposed implementation of the Project, a total of three thousand and forty four post offices and two hundred regional postal centers will be automated.  In each facility, postal services based on computer technologies will be established and will become centers of banking and communications for the population including telephone, fax and Internet.

While the Uzbek postal service, Uzbekistan Pochtasi has undertaken a review of the proposed project and drafted various memoranda and financial analyses, comprehensive technical analyses, strategic business plans and marketing plans have not been prepared to date.  In order to obtain financing for this Project, each of these important documents needs to be drafted in a manner designed to attract financing.  In order to be viewed credibly by international financing sources, Uzbekistan Pochtasi will require immediate planning, strategic and technical assistance in the following critical areas:

1. Technical expertise for validating previous assumptions pertaining to the Project. Evaluating technical alternatives and developing equipment specifications for preferred options;
2. Provision of postal management and operational expertise;
3. Highly focused technical assistance planning for the Project's nationwide deployment and rollout;
4. Preparation of a long range strategic business plan beyond the planning horizon of Uzbekistan Pochtasi's present efforts;
5. Preparation of a Marketing Plan and intensive investigation and review of all potential financing options; 
6. Preparation of an Investment Opportunity Memorandum  (or Investment Prospectus) intended to be utilized to attract financing; 
7. Overall strategic assistance to enable Uzbek Pochtasi to implement the Project successfully; 
8. Preparation of investment documents to assist in making decisions on investment in the postal communications sector in Uzbekistan.

The U.S. firm selected to conduct this feasibility study will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $431,300 grant to the Communications and Information Agency from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).
 
A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP) is available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal to the Communications and Information Agency of Uzbekistan c/o TDA by 4:00 P.M., August 15, 2002, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Communications and Information Agency of Uzbekistan reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  Communications and Information Agency of Uzbekistan also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.

<DESC>Based on the MOU between TDA and the Government of Uzbekistan signed last November, TDA commissioned a Definitional Mission in the fertilizer sector that visited Uzbekistan in March 2002.  The DM reviewed five different projects in the fertilizer sector, and the Navoi fertilizer complex project was found to be worthy of TDA support. 

Uzkimyosanoat is the successor of the Chemical Industry Association of Uzbekistan, a Ministry-level organization that was responsible for all chemical and fertilizer manufacturing.  Uzkimyosanoat is structured as a holding company for a number of chemical enterprises.  The holding company is reported to include about 40 individual enterprises with a total employment of 40,000 persons. 

The Navoi fertilizer complex project is to construct a new 300,000 metric tons per annum (MTA) ammonia plant, a 360,000 MTA nitric acid plant, and a 450,000 MTA ammonium nitrate plant to replace existing plants at the Navoi fertilizer complex.  The facilities at Navoi are well beyond their useful life and in very poor condition.  Spare parts are often unavailable because of the age of the units, and the overall conversion efficiency is low because of the technology utilized.

The U.S. firm selected to conduct this feasibility study will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $635,000 grant to Uzkimyosanoat from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP) is available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal to Uzkimyosanoat c/o TDA by 4:00 P.M., August 15, 2002, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  Uzkimyosanoat reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  Uzkimyosanoat also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.

<DESC>In Uzbekistan, agriculture is an economic mainstay that accounts for 30% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).  Cotton, the predominant agricultural product, is cultivated in western Uzbekistan.  Due to the arid climate that prevails in western Uzbekistan, irrigation plays a key role in its economy.  Uzbekistan draws its irrigation water from the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya, the two common sources of water for the five countries of Central Asia.

Despite the importance of irrigation and drainage systems to the population of Uzbekistan, there has been a minimum investment in their operation and maintenance (O&M) over the last ten years.  As a result, there is an imminent threat of a total breakdown of the irrigation infrastructure.  In addition, high rates of water losses are documented for all components of the irrigation systems, including the lack of drainage channels for the recovery of unused water.  In response to the unsustainable level of water losses from its current irrigation system, aging and obsolescence of water pumping equipment, and uncharacteristic hydro-meteorological conditions, the Uzbek Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (MAWR) is embarking on an effort to improve the operational conditions of its irrigation and water conveyance system, including improving efficiency of irrigation techniques.

According to the Irrigation and Drainage Sector Strategy Study prepared for the MAWR and the World Bank, current levels of water use for irrigation are at least 40% higher than other major irrigation countries in the vicinity, such as Pakistan and India, which, recommend investigating the feasibility of introducing irrigation water saving techniques such as drip and spray irrigation.  These irrigation techniques can serve to reduce soil and salinity and reduce pumping costs.

The introduction of non-traditional irrigation water savings techniques is a national priority, as it would be effective to promote the reduction of water losses on the order of 20%.  In addition, the water conservation demonstration project would provide ample opportunity for the introduction of irrigation water saving technologies manufactured in the U.S. that are currently not an option in Uzbekistan.

The Feasibility Study aims at the assessment of the irrigation infrastructure needed to optimize the cost-effectiveness of plausible irrigation methods applicable to the different crops grown in Uzbekistan.  The core of the assignment involves the selection of the optimal irrigation method for the goals and objectives of irrigated agricultural development.

As part of the Feasibility Study, the contractor would prepare the technical specifications and bid documents for the implementation phase of the project.  The Feasibility Study would assess the technical, environmental, financial, and economic feasibility of the project.  The Feasibility Study would generate the specific technical information to meet the loan requirements of the Government of Uzbekistan.
 
The U.S. firm selected to conduct this feasibility study will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $148,000 grant to the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP) is available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal to the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources c/o TDA by 4:00 P.M., August 15, 2002, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

The Grantee is Sociedad Puerto Industrial Aguadulce S. A. (SPIA) of Buenaventura, Colombia, and is the private operator of the existing port facility.  Buenaventura is a coastal town located near Cali, Colombia, and is a major port center.  The existing port of Buenaventura handles over half of Colombia?s external cargo, including containers, bulk solids, bulk liquids, and petroleum products.  As required by its 20-year concession agreement, SPIA is in the process of implementing improvements and expansions to the existing port, and will undertake new construction and acquire the necessary infrastructure to maintain the port activities.

In the early stages of the project, SPIA defined the technical, contractual, and financial aspects of the port development, and based upon this information SPIA contracted with the Dutch firm Haskoning to formulate a conceptual feasibility study for the project.  This initial feasibility study was completed in 1998.  SPIA currently has more up to date projections regarding financial aspects and design aspects, and they are now ready to proceed to project implementation.  SPIA has obtained the necessary licenses to begin construction, including environmental permits and approval of access road and construction permits.  They have also acquired 65 hectares of available land for the project.

Generally, the Feasibility Study requires the Contractor to:
a.	Review the Haskoning Phase II Study
b.	Perform a study and analysis of the solid bulk terminal demands
c.	Develop recommendations and design criteria for the bulk terminal facilities
d.	Analyze the requirements for the tractor terminal
e.	Develop recommendations for tractor terminal
f.	Determine general infrastructure requirements and develop recommendations
g.	Determine environmental regulations and constraints and prepare recommendations
h.	Prepare capital cost estimates for each subsection
i.	Develop an implementation schedule
j.	Develop a financing program
k.	Prepare interim, draft, and final reports

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $355,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Spanish directly to the Grantee by 4:00PM local Buenaventura time, August 30, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AF Flight Test Center intends to award a Sole Source Firm-Fixed Price contract to Northrop Grumman Corp., Amherst Systems, 30 Wilson Road, Buffalo, New York 4221-7082, to perform the development, integration and test of direct injection components into the Radio Frequency Generation and Injection (RFG&I) system originally developed by Amherst Systems and Boeing.  This is a follow-on effort to the Infrastructure and Generic Test Capability (I>C) and Electronic Warfare Test Capability (EWTC) programs, which provided for the simulation of multiple radar and other radio frequency (RF) signals in a virtual environment, along with the generation of real RF signals radiated into free space. This effort requires the contractor to complete the development and integration of existing direct injection components into the RFG&I system, utilizing the existing system design and using already-acquired system components. The resultant capability will provide for injection of RF signals into multiple sensor input ports, with control of simulated signal angle of arrival. The anticipated period of performance for this effort will be 1 Oct 02 through 1 Jan 04.  Using Authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(A), Substantial duplication of cost to the Government, the Government has determined that a sole source procurement is required due to the high level of integration required, the lack of releasable system documentation, and the extensive duplication of effort and cost should another contractor be chosen, unless responses to this notice reveal other sources capable of satisfying this requirement at more favorable terms/prices.  See Note 22.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Bridge Contract for Verification Information System
<SOLNBR>COW-2-R-0074
<RESPDATE>090902
<ARCHDATE>09242002
<CONTACT>Jeanette Housen, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-305-3113, Fax 202-616-2414, Email jeanette.housen@usdoj.gov - Joseph Spencer, Contract Specialist, Phone (202) 514-0587, Fax (202) 514-3353, Email joseph.spencer@usdoj.gov
<DESC>Description.  The Immigration and Naturalization Service intends to award a sole source bridge contract to Lockheed Martin Corporation Integrated Business Solutions.   The statutory authority for this sole source  procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) and 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1) per FAR 6.302-1(c)(2). 
This is an interim action intended to ensure continuity of support by providing a temporary "bridge" contract between the Verification Information System contract  (COW-7-C-0011) and the competitively awarded successor contract for the Verification Information System (VIS) (GS 00T99ALD02032). The period of performance will be from February 1, 2003 through January 31, 2004 through no later than July 31, 2005. The new contract will include a one-year base period with three six-month option periods. The bridge contract will allow for a continuation of the services that were provided under INS contract COW-7-C-0011.  The bridge contract is required for the orderly transition of multiple access modes to the web-based system under the competitively awarded contract.  The Verification Information System permits federal, state, and local agencies and employers to verify immigration status of non-citizens applying for benefits and/or employment as required under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 and the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996.  Due to the criticality of the system and the requirement to transition over 60,000 users utilizing multiple access methods to a new data center in a short period of time, the INS has determined it would be impossible to find another contractor with the requisite specialized experience to perform the transition in a timely, efficient, and cost effective manner. Substantial duplication of cost to the Government not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements for a critical system would result - i.e. a break in service for this critical system. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government shall consider all responses received by the September 5, 2002. Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bonafide capability to fulfill the requirement. A solicitation is not available.  Please email the contract specialist (Jeanette Housen) with responses or questions regarding this requirement at Jeanette.Housen@usdoj.gov.    
The proposed contract action, solicitation COW-2-R-0074, is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station, Panama City, Florida, intends to award an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) five-year contract on a sole-source basis to Lockheed Martin Federal Systems (LMFS), Owego, New York for engineering services in support of the Organic AMCM systems and MH-60S helicopter integration as well as fabricating production integration equipment including, but not limited to Common Consoles.  The purpose of this effort is to ensure the integration and interoperability of five separate AMCM sensors on the MH-60S helicopter. The proposed AMCM system sensors to be incorporated in the MH-60S are as follows: · AQS-20/X Advanced Sonar System (in-water towed system) · Airborne Mine Neutralization System (AMNS) · Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS) · Rapid Airborne Mine Combat System (RAMICS) · Org anic Airborne and Surface Influence Sweep (OASIS)  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The Government does not possess the technical data required for competitive acquisition.  LMFS, Owego is the sole developer and integrator of the avionics and C4I suite on the SH-60R helicopter. There is significant commonality between the SH-60R and MH-60S helicopters (in fact only the basic airframe is different). Therefore LMFS, Owego is the only source possessing the expertise, technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to perform the required engineering studies and interface requirement definition analysis required for the integration of the AMCM suite of sensors into the helicopter. Thus, this acquisition is for continued provision of highly specialized services within the meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii). Addi tionally, this commonality for logistics purposes has the potential of reducing the life cycle cost of the MH-60S / Organic AMCM capability. LMFS has spent over three years developing the avionics systems on the SH-60R and is the only source with the prerequisite knowledge of what it will take to integrate these systems. Only LMFS has the unique knowledge base and the experienced personnel necessary to successfully conduct the work.

<DESC>The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) Headquarters Procurement Office is in the process of determining the acquisition strategy for a potential requirement to provide (1) aircraft transport of detained aliens, (2) associated security (guard) services, and (3) associated medical services.  We are seeking information and comments along with sample pricing from industry regarding the draft request for proposal (RFP) to refine the requirement and acquisition strategy to include the following: (1) The Government is contemplating the award of a single firm-fixed price contract to fulfill these requirements, however, multiple firm-fixed price blanket purchase agreements may also be considered. (2) Initial research indicates that this service is commercial in nature and we are soliciting beneficial commercial practices and terms and conditions for consideration. (3) The Government is contemplating rotating the award of specific requirements/calls/task orders amongst the blanket purchase agreement awardees depending on the awardees ability to respond to urgency, favorable pricing, etc. if multiple blanket purchase agreements are issued. (4) The potential requirement may be set-aside for small business participation pending the interest received in response to this synopsis. Respondents must indicate if their firm can currently provide services that meet INS needs. Respondents are encouraged to submit sample pricing. Proprietary information must be marked as such on a page-by-page basis. The draft RFP is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure these services. The Government does not intend to make an award on the basis of this notice, nor otherwise pay for any information/items solicited in response to this notice. If the Government intends to hold a preliminary industry day meeting or conference, the relevant information regarding this event will be announced in a future FedBizOpps posting.  

To be of maximum benefit to us, responses must be received no later than August 12, 2002. Facsimile and electronic mail responses will be accepted.  To assist us in developing an acquisition strategy potential offerors are requested to provide their company name, a point of contact, address, phone number, facsimile number, electronic mail address (if applicable), business size, detailed information on their capabilities and experience, and sample pricing to the primary point of contact.

<DESC>TDA funded a Definitional Mission (DM) in February 2002 to look at 10 potential projects in the rail sector in Uzbekistan.  The DM consultant found that the upgrading of the existing rail telecommunications line has been identified as a high priority for the Uzbek government and Uzbek Railways (UTY).  Much of the current system is based on Soviet electromechanical technology and is almost obsolete.  The current system is not able to address the increasing needs of the railway and has no capability to support modern voice, data transfer, and automated technologies.

One of the telephony networks is primarily analog with electromechanical switches.  Little modern digital equipment has been introduced.  A limited number of stations have automatic connections.  For outside calls on the network, users must utilize operator-assisted connections.  The procedure is limited by the operator's switchboard capacity and the number of transmission channels.  Call end connection times do not meet modern standards, and often much time is spent in establishing end-to-end connection.  Most of the telecom installations are based on Russian standards, with components from Russia and Eastern Europe, which are no longer in production and lack compatibility with current world technology.

To complement the phone service provided through the switched telephone network, some voice and data services are provided through dedicated lines.  These dedicated lines consist of a primary railway telephony transmitter/receiver and terminal user installations connected in parallel to the transmission line.  Links to this kind of system vary widely in age and quality.

Transmission media consists primarily of copper cables, which are buried underground.  In order to have smooth railway operations, it is important to have train-to-train radio contact along the whole rail.   The condition of many of these cables has deteriorated due to moisture penetration, which causes the transmission quality to also deteriorate.  Cables are not well maintained and are susceptible to theft.

Train-to-train radio systems are also unreliable.  Track-to-train radio systems require an extensive upgrade.  The existing system has poor connections and is limited to areas around the stations.  Signaling systems, most of which are more than 25 years old, also require increasing maintenance.  UTY would like to replace signals that are more than 30 years old by 2005. 

Funding from the Asian Development Bank has been earmarked to start the upgrade process.  The upgrade will include lying of 650 km of optical fiber line between Tashkent and Bukhara.  Phone stations and the traffic control center will also be upgraded and two separate switching stations will be established.

The technical assistance involves funding a technical advisor to assist UTY in the tendering process for the fiber optics and transmission system for the Tashkent-Bukhara line.  The advisor would also review the technical specifications to ensure that they encourage international competition.  Secondly, the technical assistance would involve development of a UTY telecommunication network strategy/action plan.  The plan will include step-by-step program for the upgrade of the telecommunication system, including identification of equipment needs, specification guidelines, financing and, utilization of surplus capacity for commercial use.  

The U.S. firm selected to conduct this feasibility study will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $400,425 grant to Uzbekistan Temir Yullari from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).
 
A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP) is available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.

The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal to Uzbekistan Temir Yullari c/o TDA by 4:00 P.M., August 15, 2002, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  Uzbekistan Temir Yullari reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  Uzbekistan Temir Yullari also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  Uzbekistan Temir Yullari is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures, a firm fixed price award to  John Long, M.D., Ph.D, 9323 Creekview Drive, Laurel, MD  20708 for "Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System Calendar Year 2003 Payments for Transitional Pass-Through Drugs and Biological Agents."  The purpose of this acquisition is to procure the services of a consultant who will (1) report on options for refining how CMS calculates Medicare payment rates and co-payment amounts for pass-through drugs and biologics payable under the OPPS and (2) calculate the payment rates and co-payment amounts for pass-through drugs and biologics payable under the OPPS in 2003.  CMS seeks to outsource this task to a consultant who has a clinical background and knowledge in addition to expertise and experience in pharmaceutical coding and pricing.  By contracting this task, CMS expects to be able to establish payment rates and co-payments amounts for pass-through drugs and devices that: (a) are consistent with the methodology used by CMS to price drugs, (b) use the most recent average wholesale price (AWP) data available, (c) take into account hospitals' drug acquisition costs, (d) accurately integrate HCPCS code descriptors with AWP information in terms of dosage, vial size, and other quantifiable variables, and (e) are calculated timely for publication by November 1 in the OPPS final rule and for quarterly updates effective in April, July and October. Dr. John Long, in addition to being a Doctor of Medicine, also has a Ph.D. in pharmacology, as well as a Masters degree in Business Administration.  He has had extensive experience providing pharmaceutical product pricing as a consultant to physicians, industry, hospitals, and the government, and he has had pharmaceutical industry experience from the bench through post marketing.  As the director and chief investigator for a recent Medicare drug coverage and pricing study contracted by CMS, Dr. Long is well versed in the rules, regulations and policy affecting Medicare payment for drugs.  As part of this study, Dr. Long created a database that crosswalks HCPCS codes to NDCs, permitting a determination of the lowest dosage unit for a particular drug or biological, which is a crucial data element in determining AWP for rate-setting under the OPPS.  As a physician with a doctorate in pharmacology, Dr. Long has unique credentials both to perform the complex calculations that are required to set payment rates for drugs and biologicals, as well as to advise our policy analysts on the characteristics, uses, mode of administration, and other information about drugs, biologicals, and radio-pharmaceuticals that affects payment rates and payment policy under the OPPS for these products. Dr. Long has a proven track record within CMS; he has demonstrated that he possesses the unique combination of skills, experience, training, and knowledge that are required to set payment rates for drugs and biologicals under the OPPS; and he has ready access to the tools and most up-to-date resources that are needed to update drug payment rates under the OPPS for 2003.  All responsible sources may submit capability statements in consideration to the Agency at the above address.

<DESC>NA Estimated draft solicitation issue date is August 5, 2002.  Estimated closing date of draft solicitation is August 20, 2002.  Estimated final solicitation issue date is September 10, 2002. Estimated final solicitation closing date is October 10, 2002.  The  U.S. Army is in the process of modernizing all Sets, Kits and Outfits (SKOs).  Each SKO consists of a wide variety of tools and equipment essential to providing support to the Army’s inventory of technologically advanced tactical and combat support weapon  systems to meet the Army’s Ordnance and Combat missions.  This process is incremental.  With the completion of each redesign, each SKO will be procured and fielded. The Army is soliciting proposals from large and small businesses to establish long-term Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contracts for various tool sets, kits and outfits (SK0s).  It is the Army’s intent to make multiple awards under this solic itation to both large and small businesses.  Individual delivery orders will be competed among all awardees unless it is determined that a specific delivery order should be competed exclusively among small business awardees.  The Army will follow the Feder al Acquisition Regulation's  “rule of two” in determining whether a specific delivery order is to be competed among small business awardees (See FAR 19.502(b)). SKO's are defined as:   	Sets:  a collection of tools/components used by a group, section, squad, platoon or unit usually supplemented by tool kits to perform an organizational mission. Unit of issue of Set (SE) 	Kits:  An assembly of tools/components in a small pouch or box designed for use and carried by an individual or crew. Unit of issue of Kit (KT) 	Outfits: An assemblage of tools or equipment.  May include separately type-classified items as a component such as: Pneumatic Tool and Compressor Outfit, Water Purification Outfit, Tool Outfit Hydraulic Systems Repair and Tool Outfit Pioneer Portable Elec tric Tools. Unit of issue of Outfit (OT). For your information, Army Tools are defined as an instrument, implement, utensil, device or machine, powered or hand operated, used in diagnosis, making operating adjustments, performing damage or fault repair and preventive maintenance of Army material. In order to promote competition this requirement has been divided into the following segments: 1. Mechanical Maintenance Tool Kits:  An assemblage of mostly hand tools used by automotive, aircraft, and equipment mechanics, and others in the mechanical trades for performing field maintenance and repair.  The kit is transported to its place of final u se in a single person or multi-person carry tool container.  These kits are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 2. Construction/Engineer Tool Kits:  An assemblage of mostly hand tools, including powered hand tools, primarily used in the construction trades to perform construction and repair of facilities, power lines, etc.; transported to its place of final use in a  single person or multi-person carry tool container.  These kits are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 3. Specialized Tool Kits:  Assemblages of hand tools, measuring tools and equipment, or special-purpose tools and equipment used to perform a specific mission not normally associated with mechanical maintenance or building trades.  These kits may be housed  in a single or multiple hand carry containers.  These kits are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 4. Containerized Shop Sets:  An assemblage of tools and machinery used to perform field tasks (maintenance, repair, assembly, disassembly, disabling, adjustment, testing, etc.) on equipment or field construction, transported to its place of use as a unit i n a container or shelter, which is considered to be part of the mobile shop set.  Usually some of the components o f a mobile shop may be permanently mounted to the container or shelter by mounting bolts or other fasteners.  These sets are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 5. Vehicle/Trailer Mounted Shop Sets: An assemblage of tools and machinery used to perform field maintenance or field construction, transported to its place of use as a unit in a purpose-built vehicle body or trailer, which is considered to be part of the shop set.  Usually some of the components of the shop set are permanently mounted to its “carrier” by mounting bolts or other fasteners.  These sets are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to carry wartime operations. Each segment will be individually competed and awarded.  The Army intends to establish two award pools for each segment: one will be created under full and open competition and the other will be for small business concerns. Offerors may submit proposals for one or more segments.  Each segment shall require offerors to submit a technical, performance risk and price proposal based on a sample SKO requirement.  The Army reserves the right to issue a delivery order on the sample SKO proposals.  The Army further reserves the right to issue an order under the award pool established under full and open competition or the award pool of small business concerns, depending upon proposals received. Small business concerns may compete for the award pool to be established under full and open competition and the pool to be established exclusively for small business concerns.  Small business concerns may submit alternative proposals based on meeting or n ot meeting the non-manufacturers rule (see 13 CFR 121.406).  Proposals based on meeting the non-manufacturers rule must be supported by adequate documentation. Offerors not receiving an award to be included in a pool of awardees will be debriefed and will have an opportunity to file a protest.   In the event that a requirement for a delivery order is competed exclusively among small businesses and only one offeror meets the nonmanufacturing rule, the contracting officer will issue the order to that offeror provided the price is fair and reasonable  and all other technical and past performance considerations are met.  The contracting officer will substantiate any determination regarding whether a price is fair and reasonable and will not consider a courtesy offer from a large business unless the cont racting officer determines that the small business offer is unreasonable.  In the event that the small business offer is unreasonable, the contracting officer may cancel the competition and compete the requirement among the full and open pool of awardees.  Finally, a small business who is otherwise eligible for award may apply for a COC if the contracting officer determines that the small business is unable to meet the nonmanufacturers rule. Interested potential offerors are invited to attend a pre-proposal conference to discuss the solicitation.  The Pre-Proposal conference will take place at The Lodge (formerly Jumers), Bettendorf, IA from 8:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on Tuesday, August 20, 2002.  This conference is open to all contractors.  The Pre-Proposal Conference will be a working luncheon.  The cost of the luncheon is $10.00 due by August 15th, 2002.  Checks will be made out to TACOM-RI Protocol and mailed to AMSTA-LC (Protocol/Laura Batchel or), TACOM-RI, 1 Rock Island Arsenal, Rock Island, IL 61299-7630.  Sorry no credit card transactions.

<DESC>Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services intends to award a purchase order for a conference entitled ?Developing Capacity Building for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU):  Addressing their Infrastructure to Conduct Health Services Research (Southern Region)? under Simplified Acquisition procedures on a sole source basis to Southern University and A and M College, Center for Wellness, Baranco Hall, Suite 316, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70813-2124.  The objectives of the conference are to: 1) discuss barriers experienced by HBCUs in obtaining funding for health services research; 2) discuss the Office of Sponsored Programs Infrastructure that facilitate obtaining funding for health services research; 3) identify incentives available for researchers at HBCUs, such as release time or salary increases; 4) educate attendees about the process of obtaining and completing health services research grants submitted to CMS and other funding agencies; 5) identify resources, capabilities, and priorities of the Office of Sponsored Programs and Office of Academic Affairs at HBCUs; 6) increase the participation of HBCUs in research, outreach, and technical assistance activities; 7) increase the capacity of HBCUs to develop quality research; and 8) make recommendations to improve the infrastructures of HBCUs. The contractor shall supply all the personnel, materials, and supplies needed to carry out this scope of work.  The contractor shall have a thorough and demonstrable understanding of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), their needs and capabilities, and shall conduct communications with the appropriate institutions and their administrators, faculty members, researchers, and others.  The contractor will make contacts with the appropriate HBCUs and other participants about the conference.  It shall facilitate the development and implementation of this conference.  As a historically Black university, the primary mission of Southern University and A&M is to educate minority students.  The university prepares its students for careers in a number of academic/health related fields.  The university offers programs of study ranging from associate degrees to doctoral and professional degrees.  Educational opportunities are provided for traditional and nontraditional students, offering scholarly interaction among diverse people.  The university is committed to a broad program of research, both basic and applied, and creative work to stimulate the faculty and students in a quest for knowledge and to aid society in resolving its scientific, technological, socioeconomic, and cultural problems.  Southern University is unique in that it functions as an organizational and operational system with one president administratively responsible for four campuses.  The school?s program for health professions provides the necessary level of expertise required and also provides technical assistance to other HBCUs in support of their efforts to pursue research activities.  The school has a Foundation for the purposes of raising and receiving gifts from the private sector.  Additionally, the Foundation is designated to administer funds and manage assets to enhance the quality of education and research within the Southern University System.  Within the Foundation, each department and center is assigned a special financial account and all funds designated for use by that center is deposited and dispensed from that specific account. Further justification for the sole source award to Southern University resides in its technical capabilities, which have been applied in the past to HBCUs projects similar to that within the Statement of Work for this proposed contract.  Furthermore, CMS staff determined the conference should be held in a location such as Louisiana where many HBCUs are located in surrounding states.  All responsible sources may submit capability statements for consideration to the Agency at the above address.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, on behalf of the Administration for Children and Families, Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation (OPRE) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation (MDRC) to modify contract number 105-99-8100, entitled the ACF Employment Retention and Advancement Evaluation Project, to extend the period of performance from September 30, 1999 through September 29, 2004 to September 30, 1999 through September 29, 2007.  MDRC is currently evaluating programs at 15 sites in eight states aimed at helping the working poor retain the employment they find and advance towards self-sufficiency.  It has taken MDRC a considerable amount of time to provide technical assistance in order to prepare study sites for a random assignment of subjects for experiments.  The Contractor must be able to evaluate the sites in order to determine program impacts on clients.  Sites must provide treatments to experimental group members that are sufficiently different from the treatments provided to the control group and treatment must be delivered with regularity to all experimental group members.  Finally, the number of members assigned to each group must be large enough to detect any impacts.  The technical assistance process has been further slowed down because some sites have dropped out of the project while new sites must be brought up to speed.  Additionally, some states have implemented retention and advancement programs that require multiple interventions and various evaluations.  Consequently, because of unanticipated drop-outs and replacements, and the need to conduct more than one evaluation in some states, the Contractor has expended more time and effort on site development than initially planned. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  MDRC is uniquely qualified for the following reasons:  MDRC is currently providing the services under the above referenced contract.  It is currently providing technical assistance to the sites participating in the employment retention and advancement programs for the working poor study.  MDRC has been working with the sites for almost two years and has developed professional relationships crucial to the project with the site directors.  MDRC has formulated the research design that is best suited for each site to achieve desired results.  MDRC has the skills and knowledge to conduct multi-site experiments on a large-scale basis.  Vendors who are interested in this acquisition must demonstrate in writing they can meet the Government's requirements within 45 days from the date of publication.  Responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet the requirements of the contract.  Failure to submit adequate documentation will result in the Government proceeding with a sole source to MDRC.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The NAICS code is 541612.  See Numbered Note 22.

It shall facilitate the development and implementation of this workshop.  The University of Texas San Antonio (UTSA) is a state supported co-educational university.  UTSA was established as the first public four year, comprehensive institution of higher learning in San Antonio on June 5, 1969 by the 61st Texas Legislative act, which was signed into law by the Governor.  The first class of 671 graduate students was admitted in June 1973; classes were temporarily held at the Koger Executive Center.  By that September, graduate enrollment had increased to 1,113, a 66% increase in graduate enrollment over the summer enrollment of 671.  The UTSA Campus opened in September 1975, offering upper-division courses in five colleges and an enrollment of 4,433 (2,247) undergraduates and 2, 186 graduate students). In 1976, UTSA was fully accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.  By August 1979, the undergraduate and graduate enrollment increased to 9, 400.  UTSA is the third largest component university in the University of Texas System and had been one of the state?s fastest growing public universities for much of the last decade and is predicted to increase by more than 40% in the next 15 years, reaching nearly 26,000 by the year 2010.  Because of UTSA?s Hispanic enrollment, UTSA has been designated as a Hispanic Serving Institution, (HIS) and is ranked sixth in the overall number of undergraduate degrees conferred to Hispanic (Source: National Center for Education Studies and Hispanic Outlook in Higher Education).  These rankings also show eight other undergraduate degree programs at UTSA among the top ten nationally in the number of degrees awarded go Hispanic students.    UTSA also ranked third in business, marketing, and teacher education degrees.  UTSA is the fourth largest provide of teacher education degrees in the State of Texas.  The University leads the nation in the number of undergraduate degrees conferred in the biological sciences awarded to Hispanic (Source: Hispanic Outlook in Higher Education).  Moreover, by the year 2010, UTSA is predicted to have 33% of all UTSA students from under-represented groups enrolled in what the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board has identified as ?critical fields? science and engineering, and behavioral sciences.  Moreover, graduate student?s GRE scores have increased by 80 points in the last five years.  In addition minority student at UTSA now earn 63% of all master?s degree granted compared to only 22% during 1989 ? 1990.  The City of San Antonio had maintained a strong multi-ethnic tradition which is reflected by an ethic distribution of 55.6% Hispanic, 7% Black American, 35.9% Anglo Americans, and 1.5 % other non-white (U.S. Census Bureau, 1999).  Although still not at parity with the city?s ethnic distribution, UTSA through aggressive recruitment, has shown a substantial and progressive growth in minority student( Hispanic American, African Americans, Native Americans, and Asian Americans) enrollment since its establishment.  In 1980, minority enrollment was 24%.  By 1985, Hispanic, Black, Native and Asian American students totaled 3,157 or 26%.  This fall (?00), minority enrollment is 55%, including 45% Hispanic, 5% African Americans, 3% Asian Americans, and 2% International students. Female student enrollment is 56%.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Pacific Northwest Region, hereby announces it's intention to award a sole source contract to Microwave Data Systems, 175 Science Parkway, Rochester, New York, 14620-4201.  The existing microwave system utilized at the Snake River Area sites is an MDS, 960 MHz digital microwave system with a bandwidth of 384 Kbit.  More information is needed from our SCADA system that requires BOR to increase the bandwidth of three links to 768 Kbit.  By staying with the MDS radio system, compatibility will be maintained with the next two  existing microwave links that are not being upgraded.  By upgrading the MDS system,  BOR  will be able to utilize the same test equipment that was used on the old system.  Many of the current spare parts will also be compatible with the new upgrade.  The lower bandwidth equipment will be installed as a spur from the upgraded backbone.  Upgrading the existing system is a quicker and more cost efficient option than replacing it with another product.   The NAICS code for this requirement is 334220 and the size standard is 750.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within ten days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.    This solicitation is being issued unrestricted as Request for Quotation No. 2002-Q-00476.   The NAICS is 333992 with a size standard of 500 employees.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-07.   The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in Morgantown, WV has a requirement to purchase automatic robotic welding equipment to study the effects of welding fumes.   An estimated 800,000 workers are employed full-time as welders.  Worldwide Epidemiological studies have indicated that a large number of welders experience some type of respiratory illness.  Respiratory effects seen in full-time welders have included bronchitis, airway irritation, metal fume fever, lung function changes, and other complications.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Morgantown, WV facility has a requirement for modification of our existing manual gantry system by upgrading the structural components and adding a motorized control system.   The upgraded gantry system will safely and reliably protect human subjects from serious injury from potential falls during the stilt gait study.  The upgraded gantry system will include an electrically controlled "motion following" system.  This system will include joy stick controlled motors which will be able to eliminate the inertial forces as exerted to the human subject, such as initial motion and braking force.  Deliverables include:  (1)  upgrading the current Parker linear actuators to belt and servo-driven linear actuators;  (2)  addition of a new linear actuator;  (3)  design of an electrical control system for upgraded 3-axis gantry;  (4)  software design for upgraded system; and  (5)  on-site integration of upgraded gantry and control system.  The delivery schedule desired is 12 to 14 weeks after contract award.    ALL INTERESTED VENDORS MUST VISIT OUR SITE to review the existing system, gain a thorough understanding of the systems proposed for use, and identify components that may be salvaged and reused.  It is recommended that arrangements to visit the lab be made through Brenda Goodwin, 304/285-5882 for as soon after the solicitation issue date as possible.  NIOSH expects full rights to any possibilities for publication of this work.  Request for Quotation 2002-Q-00558 which shall be issued unrestricted on or about August 2, 2002, contains the complete background information and statement of work which must be met by any offeror to be considered for award.

<DESC>The Applied Research Program within the Division of Cancer Control and Population Science, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, plans to negotiate with the School of Public Health, University of California at Los Angeles 90095, for a contract modification for a 30 month period to conduct a state-wide health interview survey in California, called the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS 2003).  The information to be collected will assist in measuring the burden of cancer in the population of the United States. NCI anticipates comparing the CHIS (California Health Interview Survey)  data with NHIS (National Health Interview Survey) and conducting comparative and pooled analyses that will enable better estimates of health-related behaviors and cancer risk factors for smaller racial/ethnic minority populations. California, the most populous state in the nation, is also the most racially and ethnically diverse.  Due to the rich diversity of the California population, data will be collected on a randomly drawn sample, and it will not be necessary to oversample  to obtain detailed information on specific populations and/or health topics. Specific populations of interest include African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans.  With these data, NCI anticipates improving its estimates for cancer risk factors and screening among racial/ethnic minority populations.   Analyses will provide county-level and ethnic group-specific information on cancer prevention and control behaviors and health services utilization and will examine factors responsible for underutilization of preventive services.   The statutory authority for the noncompetitive acquisition is 41 USC 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  Numbered Note 22.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) After date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   No collect calls will be accepted.

The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design for a new, multi-tenant United States Courthouse, in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements.  The United States Courts will be the primary tenant of the new building.  The building is approximately 250,000 gross square feet, including 22 interior parking spaces, at a proposed site location in downtown Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  GSA Heartland Region, Solicitation No. GS06P02GZC0520 (PCN NIA97007).  -The Estimated Construction Cost range is $50 - 60 million.  Point of Contact: GSA Project Manager, John T. Topi, telephone (816) 823-4903, FAX (816) 926-3571, E-mail john.topi@gsa.gov; GSA Contracting Officer, Georgann Butler, telephone (816) 823-4918, FAX (816) 926-3571, E-mail georgann.butler@gsa.gov.  Interested parties may provide submittals as noted below.

The facility will be designed in metric units.  The scope of work will require at a minimum; metric (System International) construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and post construction contract services (PCCS) for a courthouse that includes the construction of a new building and related systems, interior parking, site development, client program requirements, and sustainable features.  The building is also to include GSA design standards for secure facilities.  A site proposed by the City of Cedar Rapids, at the Southern edge of downtown, adjacent to the Cedar River, is under consideration.  This new project will be an expression of the American architectural tradition and a visual testimony to the enterprise, vigor and stability of the American Government.  The new Courthouse will reflect the dignity of the Courts and invoke the open legal system of the United States, while maintaining current security requirements.  The new Courthouse will become an integral part of downtown Cedar Rapids and should make a distinct architectural statement that it is responsive to the overall urban design quality of life of the burgeoning mixed-use neighborhood.  
This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work.  The objective of the selection process is to procure the services of an excellent designer and firm, supported by highly qualified design professionals, who will design a building that exemplifies Design Excellence.  Accordingly, this will be a two (2) stage selection process, under GSA Design Excellence procedures, that will establish the experience and design ability of the Lead Architectural Designer and his/her firm in Stage I and the entire project team's qualifications in Stage II.  The A/E firm as used in this RFQ is an association, joint venture partnership or other entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project design.  The Lead Designer is the individual or design studio that will have primary responsibility to conceive the design concept and the building's architecture.  The A/E firm must address the contractual relationship with the Lead Designer and project team in Stage II.  When developing the project team required for Stage II, at least 35% of the design effort, including working drawings, must be performed within the State of Iowa.  The short-listed A/E Firms/Lead Designers shall be required, in Stage II of the selection process, to demonstrate how this will be accomplished.  5% of the Stage II scoring will reflect how the A/E team meets this goal.

The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows: In Stage I, interested firms will submit portfolios of accomplishment that establish the design capabilities of the A/E Firm and its Lead Designer.  All documentation will be in an 8 ?" x 11" format.  The portfolio shouldinclude the following: a cover letter referencing the FedBizOpps announcement and briefly describing the firm and its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments; and modified Standard Form 254 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire) and Standard Form 255 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire for Specific Project). Identification of consultants is not required at this stage.  

Submission requirements and evaluation criteria: (1) Past Performance on Design (35%): The A/E Firm will submit graphics (maximum of three pages per project) for five (5) new construction projects of similar size or complexity completed in the last ten (10) years.  Submittal of less than five (5) projects will result in a lower score.  If more than five projects are submitted, only the first five (5) will be considered.  Projects not completed within the last five (5) years will not be considered.  The narrative (maximum of two pages per project) shall address the design approach with salient features for each project and discuss how the client's program, function, image, mission, economic, schedule and operational objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution.  Include tangible evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc. demonstrating design excellence.  Provide a client reference contact for each project, including name, title, address, phone, and fax numbers.  A portion of one page presented for each project must include a representative floor plan and either a site plan or a building section.  (2) Philosophy and Design Intent (25%): In the Lead Designer's words, (maximum of two typewritten pages) state his/her overall design philosophy and approach to the challenge of public architecture, issues such as the integration of energy-conscious and low maintenance design features, and other parameters that may apply in creating a state-of-the art courthouse in an urban neighborhood environment.  (3) Lead Designer Profile (15%): Submit a biographical sketch (maximum of three pages) including education, professional experience, recognition for design efforts inclusive of examples.  Identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to each project. (4) Lead Designer Portfolio (25%): Submit a portfolio representative of the Lead Designer's ability to provide design excellence.

The narrative shall address the design philosophy with salient features for each project and discuss how the client's program, functional, image, mission, economic, schedule, and operational objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution.  Include tangible evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc., demonstrating design excellence.  Where there is duplication with criteria (1), the Lead Designer will address his or her participation in the project.  

An A/E Evaluation Board consisting of a private sector peer and representatives of the client and GSA will evaluate the submissions.  The Board will establish a short-list of three to six firms.  

For Stage II, the short-listed firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants.  A follow-up announcement shall be placed in this publication containing a list of the short-listed firms.  Each firm will be required to complete Standard Forms 254 and 255 that reflect their entire design team.  The Government will establish the detailed evaluation criteria and the date that these submittals are due and provide the selection criteria for the interviews along with the Stage I short-list announcement.  Sufficient time will be provided for the A/E Design Firm/Lead Designer to establish its team.  The Board will interview each team.  Candidates should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the criteria indicated above and to demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements.  Emphasis will be placed on the unique aspects of the project, design philosophy, possible approaches in carrying out the project and project management.  The Stage II evaluations will culminate with an interview with the A/E Evaluation Board.  Final selection will be based on evaluation of the Stage II submittals and each firm's interview.

The anticipated final A/E contract will include pre-design, schematic design, design development and construction document services.  The contract may include options for bidding services, tenant improvement services and construction contract administration services. Construction documents may require a single bid package, or multiple bid packages.  Construction may be achieved through Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc), also referred to as CM at risk.  The CMc will be involved in the design process, to provide construction expertise, estimating and cost information, and constructability review.  The CMc will continue with construction by separately procuring contracts for construction.

In addition, this building will be designed to meet the LEED Silver standard, or greater, as defined by the U.S. Green Building Council.  Where offerors propose in-house staff to provide special services, offerors should demonstrate that the qualifications of in-house personnel are equivalent to that of a consultant.  Inclusion of a "certified fire protection engineer" and a vertical transportation consultant on the Stage II design team is required.  The Lead Architectural Designer of the selected team will be involved in the selection of an artist and development of artwork as part of the Art-in-Architecture program.
Design shall be hard metric (System International - SI).  Drawings shall be created and submitted in native AutoCAD, latest release.  Drawings created in other CAD programs and then translated to AutoCAD are not acceptable.  Formatting for electronic drawings shall be per GSA standards.  Specifications, reports, databases, and similar items shall be submitted in native MSOffice 2000, latest release format.

The authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304 (c)(1). The solicitation will be available electronically at www.neco.navy.mil or by written request by letter or telefax (215-697-9738) to FISC Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia Code 02P521. See Note 22.

The building is approximately 250,000 gross square feet, including 22 interior parking spaces, at a proposed site location in downtown Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  GSA Heartland Region, Solicitation No. GS06P02GZC0520 (PCN NIA97007).  -The Estimated Construction Cost range is $50 - 60 million.  Point of Contact: GSA Project Manager, John T.

A site proposed by the City of Cedar Rapids, at the Southern edge of downtown, adjacent to the Cedar River, is under consideration.  This new project will be an expression of the American architectural tradition and a visual testimony to the enterprise, vigor and stability of the American Government.  The new Courthouse will reflect the dignity of the Courts and invoke the open legal system of the United States, while maintaining current security requirements.  The new Courthouse will become an integral part of downtown Cedar Rapids and should make a distinct architectural statement that it is responsive to the overall urban design quality of life of the burgeoning mixed-use neighborhood.

For Stage II, the short-listed firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants.  A follow-up announcement shall be placed in this publication containing a list of the short-listed firms.

<DESC>This presolicitation notice/procurement replaces the previous release, dated 26 Jun 2002.  The purposes of this amendment are to: provide the solicitation/BAA number; correct an error in the quad chart format; clarify the points of contact; and, confirm the response date.  

The solicitation/BAA number for this effort is M67854-02-R-6064.  

Offerors who have submitted responses are invited to revise offers based upon the changes included in this amended announcement, at their discretion.  

 (1) General Statement of Research Need Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), in support of the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD), is soliciting quad proposals that address research and development for the application and employment of new nonkinetic/limited effects/non-lethal weapons for crowd control and area denial to personnel. Some of the operational context for crowd control and area denial to personnel is to: Disperse a crowd within 50 meters of friendly forces, disperse a crowd that is 50-1000 meters from friendly forces, direct crowd movement, contain or stop the crowd from advancing, deny area to personnel in urban/suburban and rural/open terrain, or provide for force protection against a point or area threat. Submissions should describe assimilation of new and/or existing technologies that can be mounted on platforms such as Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) or in existing weapons such as 40MM grenades and 12 gauge shotgun rounds. This solicitation will NOT fund development of any new UGVs. Some possible technologies are advanced riot control agents, dazzling lights/lasers, electrical shock suppression systems, audible acoustics (no infrasound, please). The desired capabilities for the payload is for quick human effect onset time (less than 90 seconds), ideally has a human effect duration of between 10-60 minutes, temporarily renders target incapable or unwilling to continue, its deployment is readily evident, requires no decontamination and is not an environmental hazard, is difficult to countermeasure, and can be stored for at least five years. A statement of the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) for the technology is required (A description of TRLs and proposal format can be found at the JNLWD website www.jnlwd.usmc.mil in the Technology Investment Program Solicitation tab). The quad proposals should address work to be conducted over a period not longer than two years. Proposals should be no more than $250,000. All quad proposals selected for funding will be required to submit quarterly status reports that include financial data and present an annual Director's review. At project completion, a comprehensive report and outbrief will be required. (2) Instructions for Preparation of Proposals Offerors are invited to electronically submit an initial quad proposal, in either MS PowerPoint or Adobe Acrobat (the quad proposal file size can be no larger than 1.5MB due to server limitations). If the file size is larger than 1.5MB, the proposal must be mailed and postmarked by 25 July 2002. If your quad proposal is classified, please inquire to receive appropriate instructions. The initial proposal shall be in the form of a quad chart which contains a title and the following information: UPPER LEFT QUAD: a Photograph or artist?s concept of the project end-item. Ideally, this will convey the main idea of the final capability/use of the prototype. It should further give an idea of the size and weight of the end item. UPPER RIGHT QUAD: payload description: what type of technology is involved, TRL, what indicates the technology will be a success (specific research criteria, analogy to other systems, currently fielded capability, theoretical evaluation), what areas/gaps in the technology exist. Health effects: identify specific research that will allow a thorough characterization, counter-personnel non-lethal systems shall have reversible effects (permanent/severe injuries should be minimized). The desire is for weapon effectsto become inert and/or have no residual effect on humans with the simple passage of time; include the duration of the effect. LOWER LEFT QUAD: Proposed technical approach: tasks, prior efforts, rough order of magnitude costs and schedule. LOWER RIGHT QUADRANT: Deliverables to include quarterly status reports, final reports, final outbriefs, any hardware, software, etc. Include Point of Contact information (address, email, and phone number). Invitations for final proposals will be extended after evaluation of quad proposals. Offerors submitting the most promising initial quad proposal will be invited to submit a full technical and cost proposal on all or part of their initial proposal submission. Final proposals will be submitted electronically in either MS PowerPoint or Adobe Acrobat. File sizes smaller than 1.5MB may be submitted electronically by 27 September 2002. Files larger than 1.5MB must be postmarked by 27 September 2002. However, any such invitation does not assure a subsequent award. Final proposals should not exceed fifteen (15) pages of text and will be required to have the following three sections: 1) Technical Section includes: (a) a clear statement of objectives, tasks, and description of proposed concept, (b) provide background information in areas of technical, historical and applicability, (c) technical approach and methodology: The proposal shall identify the technology, explain how and why it would be effective, and provide rationale for verifying the desired effect. Specific areas to address include: What type of technology is involved? Electronic? Electromagnetic? Mechanical? What is the proposed delivery mechanism? What indicates that the technology will be a success? (Specific research, analogy to other systems, currently fielded capability, theoretical evaluation). What areas or gaps in the technology need to be researched/explored? (d) Discussion of associated risks, (e) Health Effects - The proposal should identify specific research that will allow a thorough characterization. The proposal should be able to identify the effect the weapon will have on the targeted individual(s) and address the overall health effects (including how such effect is known) associated with employment of the system. Counter-personnel non-lethal systems shall have reversible effects (permanent/severe injuries should be minimized). The desire is for the weapon effects to become inert and/or have no residual effect on humans with the simple passage of time: What is the mechanism for the desired effect? What are the important parameters for describing the desired effect and what is the threshold for effectiveness in terms of those parameters? What is the duration of the desired effect? What are the most likely undesired health effects from the use of the technology? What are the important parameters for describing the undesired health effects and what are the thresholds for those undesired effects? What is the variability in response over the range of the human population? (f) describe the schedule for developing the proposed concept and relate to near (2-4 years), mid (4-7 years) and/or far (greater than 7 years) term. 2) A Management Section which includes a description of relevant corporate expertise, experience, facilities, and other relevant resources, and resumes of key personnel. 3) A Cost Section, which provides a detailed breakdown (a plan of actions and milestones) of the proposed effort described in the technical section and deliverables. Cost needs to include travel to JNLWD Quantico for two reviews per year and the cost of producing a final technical report. Included in the final report shall be a signed cover sheet by your organization?s senior management, table of contents, abstract or executive summary, references, and conclusions. The Cost Section will not be included in the 15 page proposal limit. The deadline for initial quad chart proposals will be 1600 EST 25 July 2002. Final proposals will be required by 1600 EST, 27 September 2002. Offerors must state in their initial quad proposal and final proposal that it is submitted in response to this BAA. This BAA provides no funding for initial quad proposal or subsequent final proposal development purposes. All initial quad proposals will be acknowledged. Initial quad proposals will not be returned after evaluation. (3) Criteria for Selecting Proposals, Their Relative Importance, and the Method of Evaluation. The selection of quad proposals for award will be based on a scientific review of proposals submitted in response to each BAA. In accordance with FAR 35.016(e), initial quad proposals and final proposals will be evaluated using the following criteria, shown in order of importance: (1) Technical Merit (degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to JNLWD are proposed; offeror's ability to implement the proposed approach as demonstrated by specific accomplishments in the technical field to be studied.) (2) Importance to Agency Program. (3) Availability of funds. (4) Cost realism and reasonableness. (5) Past Performance. (For example: Ability to comply with performance schedules, prior experience, quality, management) THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR AWARD ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED. This FBO notice constitutes the BAA as contemplated by FAR 6.102(d)(2). Awards may take the form of a cooperative agreement, grant, or other contractual agreement. Unless otherwise stated herein, additional written information is not available. No formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement will be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded.  Initial quad proposals should be submitted by the due date cited in the BAA via electronic mail to Scott Bishop at bishopsp@mcsc.usmc.mil or via express mail to Marine Corps Systems Command, 3041A McCawley Avenue, Code CTQ6SB, Quantico, VA 22134.

<DESC>The National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Vieux & Associates, Inc. 1215 Crossroads Blvd., Suite 118, Norman, OK  73072-3359 to acquire Vflo Hydrologic model services, licenses and customization.  The goal of this project is to improve flood and flash flood warnings and forecasts in upland basins in the Tar River Basin, North Carolina.  Vieux & Associates Inc. has already developed a physics-based distributed parameter rainfall-runoff model called Vflo.  This model is written in JAVA providing a secure client/server configuration for flood forecasting.  Current configurations involve a desktop version running on a PC with connection to a server holding quantitative precipitation estimates (QPE) generated by QPESUMS.  Vflo is a physics-based runoff model that can estimate discharge at any location in a watershed.  Predefined flood levels may be set as part of a floodwatch.  Basin characteristics such as slope, drainage length, soils, and land cover are combined with multisensor rainfall input from QPESUMS to improve flood forecasting in upland basins.  The proposed effort would focus on application of Vflo with multisensor input from QPESUMS.  The model will be setup and calibrated for selected events for the Tar River Basin.  Vieux & Associates Inc. will provide setup of a web-version of the Vflo model, couple and ingest input from QPESUMS, perform an initial calibration for selected one to two storm events, train personnel on use and operation of Vflo.  The real-time model operation, distributed flood level criteria development, and operational implementation will be the responsibility of the NWS.  The following are project deliverables:  1.  Initial model data and parameterization for selected storm events.  2. Software Licenses for Operational Servlet making QPESUMS data available to Vflo and 2 copies of Desktop Vflo 2.0.  3.  Prototype web page for Custom Vflo Enterprise.  4. Install 1-Servlet installation at QPESUMS site.  5. Support for Desktop Vflo installation on 2 user PCs.  6. Training 1-day course on using Vflo for distributed hydrologic modeling for up to 10 persons.  Purpose: Learning model concepts and capabilities and testing parameter maps. 7. Prototype web page hosted on NOAA/NWS/NSSL server receiving real-time QPEWUMS data via servlet.  Work will be performed over a 6 month period.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100,000. FAR Clauses in full text are at http://www.ARNET.gov/far/ .  This synopsis is issued for information only.  No competitive solicitation is planned.  No award will be made on the basis of requests in response to this notice.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  Under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Engineering Field Activity Northwest (EFA NW) intends to increase the capacity under contract N44255-00-D-2476, Indefinite Quantity Architect-Engineering Contract for Environmental Restoration Projects at Various Locations Serviced by EFA NW by $500,000.00 on a sole source basis.  Contract N44255-00-D-2476 was awarded on 14 September 2000 to URS Group Inc. and included a base year and two option years.  The maximum contract value for the base year and option years was $5,000,000.00 combined.  The base year expired on 13 September 2001 and the first option year was awarded.  The first option expires on 13 September 2002.  The remaining capacity is not adequate to accommodate two upcoming projects for complete a Method II and Method IV Comparison at Adak, Alaska and perform a Work Plan Implementation and Reporting for Landfill Sites at Fallon, Nevada.  The Government has determined that awarding these projects to another contractor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government and would considerably increase the time of performance.  This is NOT a request for proposal.  However, if another firms believes it can perform these services with greater dollar and time savings than anticipated by the Government by going sole source, they need to demonstrate so to the Government.  Your documentation should be submitted to Engineering Field Activity, Northwest, Attn: Karen Smith, 19917-7th Avenue NE, Poulsbo, WA 98370-7570 no later than 4:00 p.m. local time on the response date.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed work based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>R -- Long Term Care Services
<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) administers two of the largest Federal health care programs?Medicare and Medicaid. However, during the two decades since the agency was established, its mission has grown far beyond the administration of these programs. CMS?s mission is to assure health care security of program beneficiaries, currently more than 72 million individuals. To carry out its work, the agency partners with many entities, including State, Tribal, and territorial governments, organizations and individuals. CMS readily views Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs) as another resource to address ways to more expeditiously accomplish its mission. On October 19, 1996, President Clinton signed Executive Order 13021, establishing a mechanism to facilitate TCU?s access to Federal resources. The Executive Order laid the groundwork for a White House Initiative to raise awareness of Tribal institutes of higher education throughout the Federal government and to promote their participation in Federal programs. Having participated in the Tribal-State regional health forums conducted by the Assistant Secretary for Health, Department of Human Services (DHHS) in 1995-96, CMS learned first-hand of many Tribal health concerns. Long term care (LTC) services in Indian Country are practically non-existent. Tribes have repeatedly requested assistance from CMS in looking at their LTC needs, to assist them in gaining access to Medicare and to assist them in working with states in the establishment of Medicaid LTC services. CMS have found there to be a great need for education at the tribal leadership level as to what services are available in LTC, what it is that CMS does relative to LTC and to provide them with concrete tools that will aid them in wading through the bureaucracy in their efforts to establish LTC services in their communities. This procurement should be awarded to Salish Kootenai because no other sources will satisfy agency requirements due to the unique nature of the Presidential Executive Order required that the Federal government assist TCU access to Federal resources. Salish Kootenai is the most qualified TCU entity in that it focuses on health care providers and delivery systems and it has demonstrated in past performance vai CMS? TCU initiative that it has the technical ability to complete this project. Based on American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC) recommendation and no other TCU available at this time to satisfy CMS requirements, Salish Kootenai is the most qualified to meet CMS?s needs.. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed action is solely within the discretion of the Government. The proposed contract is anticipated for a period of approximately 12 months effective August 1, 2002 through September 30, 2003.  This is not a request for proposal.

<SUBJECT>R -- Survey & Certification Group Training Staff
<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source  basis, under Simple Acquisition Procedures, a purchase order  to Klein Associates, 1750 Commerce Center Boulevard North, Fairbom, Ohio 45324. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Centers  for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Center for Medical and State Operations (CMSO), Survey and Certification Group Training Staff (SCGTS). CMS is responsible for administering the survey and certification training program and other programs as directed by the Secretary, under contract with States as provided in section 1864 of the Social Security Act.  SCGTS is responsible for training State and Federal staff in regard to various survey and certification issues. An essential part of the survey and certification programs is to provide effective training programs on Medicare/Medicaid program requirement. The extent to which CMS is successful in implementing the requirements of Medicare/Medicaid programs is dependent on survey and certification staff that have the ability and knowledge to interpret and apply current regulations in consistent and accurate manner. Underlying this task is the need for consistent, accurate decision making on the part of surveyors.  At the present time, CMS does not have a defined decision-making on the part of surveyors. SCGTS is specifically seeking more information about intuitive decision making and Cognitive Task Analyst (CTA). CTA is based on a theory formulated by Gary Klein, Ph.D., called the ?recognition primed decision model? (RPD). Klein bases the RPD model and CTA on over 20 years of research on decision making in naturalistic settings. Cognitive Task Analysis is offered exclusively by Klein Associates. CTA is based on Dr. Klein?s work and uses his methods. These services are offered only by Klein Associates. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed action is solely within the discretion of the Government. The proposed contract is anticipated for a period of approximately 18 months effective September 15, 2002.  This is not a request for proposal.

This extension is necessary to ensure an uninterrupted supply of this highly specialized equipment for the unanticipated increase in operations following the domestic terrorist attacks on the U.S. on 11 September 2001. 

The three contracts are as follows: USZA22-98-D-0007 - Body Armor, Ceradyne, Inc., 3169 Redhill Ave, Costa Mesa, CA  92626; USZA22-98-D-0008 - Equipment Load Carrying Subsystem (ELCS), Safariland, Ltd., Inc., 3120 E. Mission Blvd, Ontario, CA 91761; and USZA22-98-D-0005 - Backpack Subsystem, Bianchi International, 27969 Jefferson Ave, Temecula, CA  92590.

All three contracts were awarded on a competitive basis. The ordering period for all three contracts currently expires on 30 Sep 2003, and will be extended to 30 Sep 2005.  All three contracts specify a maximum quantity of systems and spare parts that can be ordered and these maximums will not be increased.

Statutory authority for these sole source extensions is Title 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. This notice is for informational purposes only; therefore no formal solicitation will result from this announcement. Questions or comments must be in writing and directed to Mike Holland via email at hollandm2@socom.mil.  See numbered note 22.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a total 100 % small business set-aside NAIC 541512.  Limit technical proposals to 5 pages plus one page for cost proposal.  Reference relevant projects and contacts for each.   A firm fixed price contract is projected for this award, bid accordingly.  One copy of each proposal shall be mailed to U.S. Small Business Administration 409 Third Street, S.W. Suite 5000, Office of Procurement and Grants Management, Washington DC 20416 by 3:30 pm August 7, 2002, faxes will not be accepted.

A contractor will develop and deliver as a prototype an online software application that will enable businesses to register their business at the state level and at the same time apply for and receive a Federal Employer Identification Number (EIN) via the Internet.  The application will utilize the block of EIN numbers given to 26 states by the IRS and will focus on 3 states initially: Washington, Illinois, and New Jersey.  Washington and Illinois have already automated their registration process; Illinois has not.  Therefore, contractor will have to integrate the output from existing electronic applications systems with IRS form SS-4 data requirements to create this single application.

The contractor will begin with an existing ?proof of concept? application called the Internet EIN Application (IEINA).  This application currently has full functionality with the exception of the ability to process high volumes.  While the logic is present for processing an infinite number of EIN applications, the proof of concept was not scaled for high volume and therefore the LOTUS DOMINO database and the hardware platform can only handle an undetermined number of applications.

The contractor shall perform all actions required to convert the ?proof of concept? system to a version that can handle several million applications per year.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to define all actions required to perform this conversion.  It is also the responsibility of the contractor to perform those defined actions, with the end product being an Internet EIN application that can process, at a minimum, two million EINs per year, the average number requested annually from IRS.  

The contractor shall also define and execute all tasks required to port this application to a more robust UNIX host platform, to be determined by SBA.  The contractor shall determine and comply with any necessary requirements as a result of the host environment.  Specifically, the application must include username and password registration as a starting point for the application.  The contractor will be required to create the appropriate use cases and be responsible for converting the business processes into an Intuit-style (i.e., Turbo Tax model) series of questions whose answers populate the appropriate state forms, state databases, and IRS SS-4.  The output for the IRS requirements will link to the block of EIN numbers already given to the states.

The application must allow the user to submit electronic EIN data as a separate input from the data entry form that is an integral part of the application currently.  Often a business owner has registered the business at the state level and has no need for a federal EIN until much later in the business life cycle.  The business owner should be able to submit electronically a request for the EIN separately from the state application. 

The requirements, schema for the EIN data and the ability to accept this data into the application shall also be the responsibility of the contractor.  This data transmission will likely be the result of state Internet applications that will take the EIN data as an integral part of their state application and then send the data electronically to the EIN application.  Currently the application processes all data as a result of the online SS-4 form that is a part of the IEINA.  

The government will own all products as a result of this task, to include, but not limited to, the requirements, the code for the application, the executable application, and any hardware and software purchased in order to host and execute the application. 

In summary, the contractor shall define and perform all actions in order to:  
?	convert the current ?proof of concept? application to a version capable of  processing a large volume of EINs , 
?	port this new version of the National Registration application to the state environments of Washington, Illinois, and New Jersey, (contractor is responsible for defining the requirements for the platform which are necessary for the enhanced Registration application to process the high volumes of EINs),
?	make modifications to the existing ?proof of concept? that will enable it to accept electronic EIN data from sources other than the current SS-4 input screen that is an integral part of the application.  The data should be very similar to that collected on the SS-4 input screen, but will be coming from outside the application, for example, from state internet applications, from banks, or other internet applications.  The enhanced application should also continue to accept data as it does currently, from the online SS-4 input screen, so that it can still function as a standalone application that processes EINs.  

Software Requirements:

?	COTS e-government software
?	Must be based on open standards
?	Must have component-based architecture
?	Individual software components must easily integrate as a complete suite or operate as stand alone components to deliver required functionality
?	Software must be able to extend to multiple delivery channels (web. IVR, wireless) utilizing XML
?	Must be able to separate form definitions, their associated styles and presentation methods to enable re-usability across multiple channels and for accessible sites through a single software application
?	J2EE or .Net compliant
?	Must have extensibility or provide APIs to enable integration with legacy or third party applications or other COTS products
?	Must be able to utilize externalized business rules outside of the application presentation layer that enable complex calculations, validations and edits

Past Performance Requirements:

?	Past performance successfully delivering e-gov, transactional applications that follow a question-answer (Turbo Tax model)?contractor must show proven applications
?	Past performance hosting/establishing secure hosting environment for e-gov transactions
?	Past performance successfully delivering accessible e-gov applications (Section 508 compliant)
?	Past performance integrating we-based transactions with existing legacy systems.

This task will require the contractor to perform the following, but not limited to these, actions, within 60-90 days of initiation of contract:

?	Define, document (action plan or project plan), and execute all actions necessary to enhance the existing proof of concept application to enable processing of large volumes of EIN applications (at least two million per year)-- contractor shall determine technical requirements of the platform, government will direct contractor as to which platform to port the application to),,
?	Modify application code to use a new database or port from existing database into new database used by SBA for this prototype,
?	Determine and document hardware and software requirements for processing high volumes of data,
?	Define, document and execute all actions necessary to enhance the existing application to enable a second source of electronic EIN data input from outside the application, i.e., separate from the state screen entries,
?	Develop XML schema for exchange of EIN data from state to the server (i.e., eventually IRS), 
?	Define, document and code any new application requirements as a result of accepting data from this second, outside source, (update existing requirements document and existing application) 
?	Define and document any new requirements (update existing requirements document) as a result of complying with target platform environment (such as security, etc),
?	Port the application to specified environment (for prototype on contractor server, on state server, or on SBA server),
?	Fully test enhanced application including testing for new functionality, and new hardware platform (this will include full integration testing with existing environment),
?	Contractor shall update existing project documentation, where necessary, to reflect enhanced application and new environment.

Applicable Clauses incorporated herein by reference:  52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, 52.212-5 Contract tems and Conditions required to implement Statutes or Executive Oders - commercial items.  And incorporates the following clauses within 52.212-5(b)1,6,11,13,15,17,18,19,21,23,26,27 and (c) 1,2,4.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation N61339-02-T-0093 is issued as a request for quote and incorporates the provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-08.This solicitation is set-aside for small business.  The NAICS Code for this solicitation is 334290 with a size standard of 750 employees. A recording has been made of the various sounds from the trainer on site using an audiocassette. A copy may be provided for use in estimating or implementing the effort and system requirements, upon request. Several of the sound samples were digitized and recorded as ?wave? files and may likewise be supplied on a CD upon request. Please contact Jun Ji to request a copy. See contact information below. The following items are required:  CLIN 0001, One (1) Each: Sound System Requirements for the Land Craft Air Cushion-Full Mission Trainer, Device 20G6. (COTS, Modified)1.0 The LCAC-FMT sound system shall have at least 8 input channels and 19 output channels capable of simultaneously providing the following two simulation functions in an integrated manner: 1.1 Radio communications simulation function: a. Seven (7) independent user positions with two (2) independent output headset channels (left and right) each and one (1) independent input channel, plus a mono-channel overhead PA channel for a speaker, and an input channel for radio traffic for a total of 8 input channels and 15 output channels shall be provided.
b. The left headset channel shall be selectable from any of seven (7) sources (i.e. from one of five (5) simulated radio receiver channels, from PA, or from MOM) c. The selection of secure voice mode on a radio system shall alter the reception to sound like the voice is being processed when the associated radio is also selected.  The sound system shall be able to switch dynamically between this processed secure voice and a non-processed normal voice. d. The simulation shall provide the user with feedback of his own voice with no perceivable delay (provide sidetone simulation). e. The PC system that provides the sound system processing shall accommodate placement in a rack approximately 80 feet from the digital-to-analog converters that are wired to headsets and the analog-to-digital converters that are wired to the microphones.  Those converters that are wired to user stations on the motion platform shall be mounted on the motion platform with the LCAC-FMT Simulator Cockpit. f. The right channel shall provide intercom (ICS) functionality. g. Separate PTT functions for radio and ICS shall be provided.  If Radio PTT is on, it shall override ICS PTT. [The PTT Switch is part of the LCAC-FMT Host I/O cockpit switches. The contractor need not supply a PTT switch for the radio or ICS but respond to the existing PTT switch by control from the LCAC-FMT Host system ] h. The sound system simulation shall utilize information from software running on the LCAC-FMT Host computer system (that is based on a dynamic matrix) for controlling the mixing both left and right channels.  This matrix on the LCAC-FMT Host computer system will provide normalized (between 0.0 and 1.0) amplitude levels for each combination of sender and receiver since there are independent volume controls for all channels on all stations, and a master volume for the headset. i. The simulation shall provide for the mixing of five (5) different tones into each of the headset radios (left channel).  These tones shall have dynamic frequencies associated with them that are set by the LCAC-FMT Host computer. j. The simulation shall provide for three (3) predefined noise sounds that shall also be mixed into the left channel that do not have dynamic frequencies associated with them, in addition to the 5 tones above. k. The total of eight (8) sounds that can be mixed into the left headset speaker are the same sounds for all stations, but can be independently on or off depending on whether the speaker is tuned to a particular channel. 1.2 Sound effect simulation function: a. Four (4) output channels (2 stereo pairs) shall be provided to supply each of four (4) speakers, one in each corner of the cockpit. b. The four (4) channels shall have independent volume levels controlled by information from software running on the LCAC-FMT Host computer system. c. Each of the four (4) channels shall provide independent simulation of engine sounds controlled from the LCAC-FMT Host computer. In the current implementation each engine simulation consists of two components as follows: (1) One (1) engine tone is controlled from the LCAC-FMT Host computer by both amplitude and frequency (2) An engine noise component is controlled from the LCAC-FMT Host computer only by amplitude. As an alternative to the engine sound simulation requirements of paragraph 1.2 c, the offeror may supply a customizable engine model that is separately controlled from the HOST computer for each of the four engines by other available parameters (e.g. throttle position, fuel flow, RPM, etc.). d. In addition to the main engines, the following sounds shall be simulated:
(1) One (1) left and one (1) right APU tone controlled by amplitude and frequency, (2) One (1) left and one (1) right APU noise component controlled only by amplitude, (3) One (1) left and one (1) right AC tone controlled by amplitude and frequency, (4) One (1) left and one (1) right AC noise component controlled only by amplitude. As an alternative to the APU and AC sound simulation requirements of paragraph 1.2 d, the offeror may supply a customizable APU and AC model that is separately controlled from the HOST computer. e.	The system shall provide a daily readiness capability that successively provides a different tone frequency to each of the four (4) channels. [There are left and right tones that are controlled by amplitude and frequency.  The amplitude and frequency do not vary during the tone. ] f. Two (2) malfunction noises shall be simulated which are a composite of many different tones and noises.  These noises are either one (1) bang (Lift Fan Fail malfunction) or up to seven (7) bangs (N1 fluctuation). To make the bang sounds different for the two malfunctions, the Lift Fan Fail malfunction adds some noise and increases the duration of the bang. The malfunctions are currently composed of the following components: (1) One (1) left and one (1) right noise component (using unused engine noise variable), (2) One (1) left and one (1) right noise component (using unused wave breaking noise variable), (3) One (1) left and one (1) right noise component (using unused wind howl noise variable), (4) One (1) left and one (1) right noise component (using unused bow thrusters noise variable), (5) One (1) left and one (1) right noise component (using unused lift fans fail malfunction noise variable), (6) One (1) tone with amplitude and frequency control (using unused CRFT FRC W/ TERR RT SPKR TON AMP variable), (7) One (1) tone with amplitude and frequency control (using unused LIFT FANS MALF RT SPKR TONE AMP variable). 2.0 The system shall have a generic engine model that can be customized to simulate the 4 engine turbines and 2 APU turbines as a minimum. 3.0 The system shall have a model or method to customize the sound effects for the simulated Air Conditioner. 4.0 The system shall support modeling or playing back the malfunction sounds. 5.0 The system shall utilize control information from a separate SGI Origin 200 Computer system identified as the LCAC-FMT Host computer system. The interface between the two computer systems shall be a standard 100 mega-bit Ethernet twisted pair connection, using TCP/IP or UDP/IP protocols. 6.0 Speakers/headsets No speakers/headsets are required.  It is planned to use the existing LCAC-FMT speakers that have amplifiers on them and the existing LCAC-FMT Host headsets. CLIN 0002, One (1) Each: Sound System Requirements for the Land Craft Air Cushion-Full Mission Trainer, Device 20G6, (Production Copy) Follow-On System Copy of CLIN 0001; CLIN 0003, Training Course, A three-day in-plant vendor training course shall be provided for at least three people. The training course shall provide information on how to establish the required functionality. It shall include how to setup the system, how to set up the necessary Ethernet communications with the HOST computer, how to setup the radios/channels, and how to customize engine sounds.  These items are intended to be utilized as follows:  LCAC-FMT, Device 20G6. Delivery shall be made no later than OCT-31-2002 for CLIN 0001 & CLIN 0002 to Brunce Riner code 4923, 12350 Research PKWY Drive, Orlando, FL 32826; acceptance shall be made at destination upon delivery.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation, DTSA20-02-R-00466 is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-07.  This solicitation is unrestricted.  The associated NAICS code is 541690 and the small business size standard is $6 Million.  The LINE ITEM is as follows:  0001 - Defensive Tactics Techniques Training, QTY= 1 JOB.  This project shall provide training to uniformed federal law enforcement officers in support of our nation's airports.  The training must consist of in-depth coverage of the following prospectus to the satisfaction of the Training Academy Director:

Survival Learning Research - This subject area examines research related to educational psychology motor learning science and neurobiology, and applies the research to the design of use of force systems.  Students will learn why simple gross motor skills and systems with few techniques are more compatible for use of force training than other methods.  

Control Principles - This subject discusses principles of control, survival reaction time, and tactical positioning.  

Tactical Handcuffing - Tactical speed handcuffing provides immediate subject control and reduces risk to the officer.  This system is designed to train the student in a method that will be the same under handcuffing conditions of standing, kneeling or prone, with the completion time of three (3) seconds.

Pressure Point Control Tactics - This subject area addresses a system of controlling subjects by applying as little as two (2) pounds of finger touch pressure to selected pressure points on head and neck.  These pressure points are applied to control passive or defensive resisance and are highly effective for officers of any size or strength level.  

Joint Locks - Escort position resistance is one of the four most common types of resistance encountered by officers.  This subject area teaches officers joint lock techniques designed specifically to control escort position resistance.  

Defensive Counterstrikes - This subject area teaches reflexive reaction to a physical attack when impact weapons or firearms are not appropriate.  The students will learn to neutralize an aggressive assault with a basic system of blocks, punches and kicks, designed to control a subject with minimal chance of injury.  

Impact Weapon Systems - Training from this subject area centers on the development of a collapsible/telescoping baton.  This effective system employs the use of nerve targets instead of joints and bones, which decreases the potential of causing connective tissue damage and bone fractures.  

Handgun Retention and Disarming - This uni teaches a simple system of disarming and handgun or long gun retention.  The students will learn holstered defenses, drawn weapon defenses as well as maintaining a long gun in the slug or open positions.  

The contractor shall deliver training to the initial class of students during the specified period of performance.  In addition, the contractor shall provide training to the TSA Training Staff and certify the newly trained TSA staff members to a level of "DT Instructor Trainer" for assumption of all future training by October 1, 2003.

Classes will not exceed 48 students and will run continuously at the rate of one or more per week.  The cost for this training shall be based on a per-student basis.  The student population will not exceed 4,500 students during the period of performance.  The contractor will provide teams consisting of not less than two (2) instructors to include:  one (1) Lead Instructor to each class of 48 students.  Each training class does not need to be consecutive in nature, but should be spread over a ten-day period.  TSA shall provide to the contrator, at its discretion, all necessary training equipment to include kickbags, batons, firearm props, and adequate facilities to conduct the training. At the conclusion of the period of performance the contractor shall relinquish all provided training equipment to the Government. 

The contractor shall develop/provide a measurable standard that addresses a pass/fail system of the required techniques to demonstrate a proficiency of the overall program.  Students must be provided with remedial assistance, if necessary, to master the techniques taught.
