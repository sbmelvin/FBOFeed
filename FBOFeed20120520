<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
The Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) intends to modify its current Government-Wide Acquisition Contract task order, GS00T99ALD0202/EP20 for the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance?s (OECA) Integrated Compliance Information System (ICIS) with Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) to increase the task order?s estimated ceiling on a sole source basis by approximately $9.4 million from $44,341,522.00 to $53,741,522.00.  The task order is a cost-plus-incentive-fee award term that consists of a thirty-four (34) and a half month base period, December 15, 2008 through September 30, 2011, and three (3) award terms through October 27, 2014.  BAH?s performance has earned Award Term 1 that began on October 1, 2011 and will end December 14, 2012.   OECA?s Enforcement Targeting and Data Division (ETDD) developed ICIS as a consolidated information system that replaced several Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA) legacy systems and it maximizes the state?s, territories? and local gov ernment?s reporting requirements of compliance with environmental regulations using the Internet, as well as the EPA?s enforcement capability.   Since the award of the competitive ICIS task order in December 2008, EPA?s requirements for the collection, storage and analysis of timely, accurate and quality of enforcement and compliance data have changed with the new National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Electronic Reporting Rule making reporting submissions via a paperless method mandatory.  This electronic reporting requirement is intricately and inextricably tied to the modernization and enhancement of ICIS? data collection capabilities is critical to the implementation of electronic reporting.  The Agency has committed to assist the various reporting entities with their migration of the data residing in their legacy systems via ICIS for electronic submission so that they are in compliance.  Unless ICIS is modernized, several entities will not have the ability to c omply with paperless submissions.    
THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION; however, any firm that believes it possesses the knowledge of ICIS and is capable of meeting the modernization and enhancement requirements may respond to this notice within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of the its publication, by submitting a capability statement of no more than five (5) pages.  Any page beyond the 5 pages will be discarded.  OECA and OAM will consider the 5 page response.  All questions and/or responses must be in writing and be directed to Lin Pinskey via email at pinskey.lin@epa.gov.  No telephone inquiry or response will be considered nor accepted.  
The point of contact for this procurement is Lin Pinskey, Contracting Officer.
