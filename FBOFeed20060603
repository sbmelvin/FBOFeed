The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20899-0001.

The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 Employees.

No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the government will consider responses received by June 15, 2006.
