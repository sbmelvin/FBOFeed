REVERSE AUCTION PROCEDURES

I. GENERAL
For the purpose of expediting price related discussions, the Contracting Officer has opted to conduct a competitive, anonymous, on-line reverse auction using Global eProcure. UNICOR has contracted with Global eProcure to conduct the reverse auction for this solicitation. HOWEVER, THE ON-LINE REVERSE AUCTION SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED TO IMPLY THAT THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING CONDUCTED UNDER THE PROCEDURES SET FORTH AT FAR PART 14, SEALED BIDDING. Rather, this solicitation is being conducted under the procedures set forth at FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in conjunction with the policies and procedures for solicitation, evaluation, and award prescribed in FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.

During the auction, Offerors will provide pricing through submission of electronic offers via the Global eProcure website. The primary pricing competition for this solicitation will be through the online reverse auction. Global eProcure will explain this process in detail and train each qualified offeror prior to the reverse auction through a simulated reverse auction. Qualified Offerors will have the ability to submit revised pricing during the auction in response to prices submitted by other offerors. The identity of offerors will not be revealed to each other during the auction. The final such revision during the auction will be considered the Offerors final proposal. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to conduct verbal or written discussions with respect to factors other than price with the Offerors at anytime prior to award.

Only offerors that have been determined qualified will be permitted to participate in the auction. Offerors who are deemed qualified will be notified by the Contracting Officer. QUALIFIED OFFERORS WILL BE CONTACTED DIRECTLY BY GLOBAL EPROCURE VIA E-MAIL REGARDING PARTICIPATION IN THE REVERSE AUCTION.

The date and time of the practice reverse auction will be October 12, 2006 at 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time.

III.	REVERSE AUCTION - THE AUCTION

a. During the reverse auction, offerors may revise their initial pricing proposal through submission of electronic offers during the anonymous reverse auction.  This reverse auction shall constitute discussions with the offerors.  The final such revision during the reverse auction will be considered the offeror's Final Revised Proposal.

b. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to suspend or cancel the reverse auction at any time.  If the Contracting Officer cancels the reverse auction, Final Revised Proposals will be requested by an amendment to the solicitation.

c. Notwithstanding FAR 52.215-5, offerors will submit revised pricing only through the online mechanism supplied by Global eProcure.  Offerors will not submit revised pricing via any other mechanism including but not limited to post, courier, fax, E-mail, or orally unless specifically requested by the Contracting Officer.

d. The reverse auction bidding period shall be set by the Contracting Officer as indicated in Section IV, paragraph (a).  Electronic offers shall be submitted by offerors during the reverse auction period.  The reverse auction is designed to extend the closing time of a bidding lot if there are any bids placed in the final 2 minutes of the bidding lot. If a bid is placed within the last 2 minutes of the closing time, the time period shall be extended for two additional minutes beyond the scheduled closing.

e. Any offeror experiencing difficulties during a reverse auction must notify Global eProcure immediately.  "Difficulties" include any event or problem, which interferes with the offeror's ability to participate in the reverse auction and may include, but is not limited to: data entry errors, software problems, or hardware problems.  Offerors will have five minutes after a Lot goes into "Verifying" status to notify Global eProcure of any problems.  If the Contracting Officer judges that any offeror has been disadvantaged by a problem, they may direct Global eProcure to address the problem and return the Lot to "Open" status.

f. Any and all offeror contact with Global eProcure is for the sole purpose of facilitating the reverse auction and shall not be considered discussions with the offeror within the meaning of FAR Part 15.

g. For purposes of FAR 52.203-2, and in accordance with subparagraph (c) thereof, submission of a proposal by the offeror shall be considered certification by the Offeror that the only knowing disclosure by the offeror of its prices to any other offeror will be during the reverse auction.  The offeror further certifies that disclosure by the offeror of its prices during the reverse auction shall not be for the purposes of restricting competition.

h. UNICOR reserves the right to reject any or all quotes received for any or all lots.

<DESC>The Environmental Management Consolidated Business Center West Valley Demonstration Project Office (EMCBC-WVDP) intends to procure services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions procedures.  In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(1), the Contracting Officer has determined that Sapere Consultants is the only source reasonably available to perform the services requried. This determination is based on the need to obtain facilitation expertise in applying the Core Team/Principles of Environmental Restoration to the resolution of several long-standing issues between the Department and its regulators and cooperating agencies at the West Valley Demonstration Site in New York. The Core Team/Principles process was developed to streamline the remedy selection process and expedite site cleanup, and has been successfully applied at numerous facilities around the DOE complex.  Two of the three individuals who assisted in the development of this process, and served as the lead facilitators in its implementation, are currently with the Sapere consulting firm; the third individual is no longer available to perform these services. Successful application of the Environmental Restoration Principles requires an experienced facilitator with an intimate knowledge of intricacies involved in the application of the principals.  Sapere Consulting is the only firm with personnel having such a background.   A determination by the Government to limit competition when using Simplified Acquisition procedures is withn the discretion of the of the Government.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541990. Mary Jane Socuten Contracting Officer 716-942-4179 All inquirys/questions should be e-mailed to mary.jane.scouten@wv.doe.gov

BIDDING PROCEDURE

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Those firms that are nominated to bid will be added to an electronic distribution list of firms eligible to bid on this ICB project. When the Invitation for International Bidding (IFIB) is issued, those firms will be notified electronically and will be instructed to download the tender documents on the following website: 

http://www.act.nato.int/budfin/rfpmain.htm.

As provided for under MBC rules, however, nominations from interested firms will continue to be accepted by the Host Nation after the IFIB is issued and until the bid closing date.

Personnel working on this project, or visiting installations and/or working at NATO sites, are required to have a NATO SECRET security clearance. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the Host Nation the NATO clearance certifications for all personnel assigned to the contract.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for  research on a new aviation safety issue in icing that has to do with ice crystal and mixed phase atmospheric icing conditions. A very specialized icing wind tunnel facility is required to conduct the mixed phase and ice particle testing.  The facility must be capable of generating stable, calibrated mixed phase icing conditions on demand.  The facility also needs to generate different types of ice particles to evaluate the response to different shaped ice particles (spherical, irregular).  The icing wind tunnel must allow unobstructed visual access to facilitate the use of NASA Glenn high-speed close-up imaging systems.  The facility must be located in the United States to minimize the travel associated with testing at this facility. The chosen facility will be used to perform tests to determine how these conditions effect aircraft engines, how to measure and determine the formation mechanisms, and how to simulate these natural conditions in a controlled, and repeatable ground test facility to understand and, eventually, replicate these phenomena.  NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from LeClerc Icing Research Laboratory (Cox and Company Inc.) 200 Varick Street, New York, NY  10014 using 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements as its justification.

<DESC>Individuals involved in the venture capitalist (VC) community are invited to apply for two-year appointments as consultants for the Defense Venture Catalyst Initiative (DeVenCI). Applicants should be experienced with emerging information technologies. Experience in other defense-related emerging technologies, such as energy, biotechnology, materials/nanotechnology, or space, is also desirable.

DeVenCI is a U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) activity that seeks to improve national security in the Global War on Terrorism. Its dual goals are to speed DoD adoption of promising new commercial technologies and to encourage broader commercial support of the DoD supply chain. DeVenCI will use workshops, technical expositions, industry outreach, and a web portal to increase the visibility of DoD needs to commercial companies and technology area experts. It will also provide timely information to DoD users about emerging technical innovations and opportunities. DeVenCI is a catalyst initiative that does not fund the development of new technologies or businesses, but rather focuses on knowledge brokering by encouraging and facilitating the sharing of information to speed emerging solutions to DoD user needs.

VCs selected to participate will serve as unpaid consultants and are expected to provide the DoD with their unique expertise in the areas of evaluating leading-edge technologies, understanding the dynamics and risks of small and emerging-technology businesses, and identification of DoD-relevant technology area experts.

Interested VCs can find additional information at http://DeVenCI.dtic.mil. Applications for two-year terms from December 1, 2006 through November 30, 2008 will be accepted until midnight, 31 October 2006.

The purpose of this acquisition is to provide all the labor, parts and software necessary for the upgrade of 32 Motorola Model XTS 5000 Model III hand-held portable radios provided to the Radiation and Indoor Environments (R&IE) National Laboratory in Las  Vegas, NV and the National Air and Radiation Environmental Laboratory in Montgomery, AL. The estimated value of this procurement is below the simplified acquisition threshold as defined in FAR Subpart 2.101. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is  334220. It has been determined that Motorola, Inc. is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's requirement given product compatibility issues, and the fact that Motorola, Inc. can only upgrade and retrofit the current inventory of Motorola-brand equipment with the ASTRO Digital CAI/IMBE,  conventional front panel programming, conventional radio cloning, and encryption standards updgrades. As such, NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. However, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a written capabilities  statement, which, if received by the response date of this announcement, will be considered.  Responses to this posting must be in writing. A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

(E3), of San Francisco, CA, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The purpose of this acquisition is to continue assessing opportunities for addressing regulatory and informational barriers, and undertaking program activities to overcome the identified barriers.  The main objective  of this work is to receive technical support in conducting research, financial and technical analysis, and outreach on effective business cases for cost-effective utility investment in energy efficiency as a strategy to lower natural gas prices, increase system reliability, and mitigate the  environmental impacts of energy.  The additional work will involve the following two tasks:  1) Continuation of monthly status calls with EPA personnel to provide updates on research and analysis, and 2) Implementation of business case reports for utility incentive policies and utility planning  strategies to increase cost-effective energy efficiency.  A key component of the work under this Purchase Order has been the development of the Energy Efficiency Benefits Calculator.  As E3 has been instrumental in the conception and design of the calculator, as well as creating the calculator and  providing analysis, it is believed that E3 is the only entity able to provide the required follow-on services.   This additional work is integrally related to work under this purchase order and cannot be separated from ongoing work.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code  for this procurement is 541620.  NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.  Not withstanding, any firm, which believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received by the response date of this announcement will be considered.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command at Patuxent River, MD intends to negotiate and award a level of effort, time and materials order for the procurement of a reliable, wireless tip cap light for the CH-46 series helicopter rotor blade.  Night flight operations require at least one rotor blade tip light be functional.  The tip lights illuminate rotor arc situational awareness.  The current wired tip light has poor reliability because the power wire running the length of the blade fails due to the affect of centrifugal force.  A wireless tip cap light is needed that will eliminate these problems.  A wireless system must be able to be turned on and off and can not adversely affect the blade weigh and balance.  Boeing will evaluate existing technology such as motion activated, motion powered - faraday lights, LED's, Piesoelectric crystals, VHF/UHF wireless remote systems for possible application on the CH-46E rotor blade.  The proposed order will be awarded on a sole source basis to the Boeing Company, Boeing Helicopters, Ridley Park, PA under Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA), N00019-05-G-0012.  The authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2304(c) (1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Amendment #A003 (attached) is issued to correct solicitation number and provide clarification on 25 page count limitation. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Announcement/SIR No. 1, DTFAAC-06-R-03394, posted June 26, 2006, is hereby superseded by the following Announcement/SIR No. 1. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, has a requirement for engineering, computer, and administrative support services in support of power, navigational aids, communications, surveillance, and weather systems.  The requirement is predominantly for hardware and software engineering services involved in the acquisition, restoration, maintenance, and modification of ground-based NAS equipment throughout the United States and some overseas sites.  Contractor management and personnel will be based at the MMAC in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  Requirements are defined further in a Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The current version of the PWS is provided as a separate document under this Announcement/Screening Information Request No. 1 (SIR1).  Interested parties are also encouraged to visit the MMAC Home Page.  Offers will be evaluated and contract award made on the basis of "Best Value to the FAA."  A Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF) type contract is anticipated for this acquisition.  The contract has a potential duration of five (5) years including a base year with four (4) 1-year options to be exercised at the sole discretion of the FAA. This requirement is offered to qualified, responsive, small business concerns through use of a "2-Tier" CASCADING ORDER OF PREFERENCE to determine the extent of eligible potential offerors.  Offers will be considered beginning with evaluation of Tier 1 and following with evaluation of Tier 2, as necessary.  Tier 1 is relegated to screening of potential offerors from among nation-wide Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Business (SEDB)/8(a) concerns and Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses.  Tier 2, if necessary, will consider nation-wide small business concerns.   The "2-Tier" process not only involves a determination of eligibility of the potential offerors at each tier, but also the number of eligible offerors from which the FAA can determine sufficient potential exists for adequate competition.  The existence of potential for adequate competition is defined as identification of at least six (6) competitive offerors from qualified, responsible business concerns at the tier under consideration from which it is anticipated that fair market prices can be obtained. If at least six (6) potential competitive offerors cannot be identified at Tier 1, then Tier 2 offerors will be considered.   If a determination as to the potential for adequate competition cannot be made from Tiers 1 and 2, the FAA reserves the right to award a contract based on full and open competition.  Potential offeror(s) identified as qualified from screenings associated with Tiers 1 and 2 will be included when considering full and open competition.  The requirement will be re-announced on the FAA's website.   For purposes of this requirement, a Small Business is defined as follows: 1) Classified as a small business under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541330, Engineering Services (Aerospace Equipment) - $25/million.   2) An eligible SEDB/8(a) small business concern expressly certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the 8(a) program and which meets such criteria at the time of submission of the offer.   3) A "Service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern"â€”  (1) Means a small business concernâ€”  (i) Not less than 51 percent of which is owned by one or more service-disabled veterans or, in the case of any publicly owned business, not less than 51 percent of the stock of which is owned by one or more service-disabled veterans; and  (ii) The management and daily business operations of which are controlled by one or more service-disabled veterans or, in the case of a service-disabled veteran with permanent and severe disability, the spouse or permanent caregiver of such veteran.  (2) Service-disabled veteran means a veteran, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 101(2), with a disability that is service-connected, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 101(16).  Should a SEDB/8(a) vendor propose a teaming arrangement, the term "vendor" applies to the prime contractor.   For those vendors contemplating entering into a joint venture please reference SBA website at http://www.sba.gov/ca/santa/sa_joint-venture_html.html.  While the FAA will be the approving authority in lieu of the SBA for any proposed joint ventures for this undertaking, the SBA standards for approving joint ventures will be employed.  All documentation to enter into a joint venture must be submitted with response to this SIR No. 1. Each firm claiming SEDB/8(a) status is required to provide a copy of its SBA 8(a) certification letter to the Contracting Officer with its response to this SIR1.  Each firm claiming status as a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business may provide a letter self-certifing their status.  Offerors are to submit a FAA Business Declaration form with their response to this announcement.  The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each offeror's program eligibility. In conjunction with the set-aside nature of the requirement, at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the prime contractor.  This requirement is found in AMS Clause 3.6.1-7, Limitation on Subcontracting.   This acquisition contemplates a phased approach.  This, the initial phase, involves the announcement/SIR1 of the requirement.  Only those firms that respond successfully to this SIR1 will be allowed to participate in the next phase.  The remaining phase(s) of the downselect process will be identified in future communications with those firms that successfully respond to this SIR1.   Companies that are interested and possess certain special standards of responsibility are to provide specific information as to the unique capabilities to be brought to the performance of this requirement.  The specific information provided must be accurate and complete because it will be used to determine each vendor's eligibility to participate.  Documentation must be provided to substantiate any statement of fact that goes to the vendor's eligibility pursuant to this SIR1.  The FAA reserves the right to contact references and verify each vendor's information.  Any statement included in a vendor's response that is verified by the FAA as either false or misleading will be cause for rejection.  Documentation includes, but is not limited to, formal resumes, licenses, financial statements, work plans, etc.  All documentation is limited to 25 pages (8-1/2"x11", printed on one side).  The 25-page limit only applies to the technical proposal (financial statements are exempt from the page limit of 25).  Failure to comply with this page limitation may be cause for rejection of a vendor's response.  CAUTION: FAA evaluators will read only up to the page limit as specified.  Four copies are requested.  Mere statements of compliance or intention to comply are unacceptable.  All responses submitted must address the capability of the vendor to meet the special standards of responsibility.   SPECIAL STANDARDS OF RESPONSIBILITY: The following information must be addressed in each vendor's submission in order for the FAA to determine a vendor's eligibility to participate further in any subsequent SIR.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT:  The Northern Region Contracting Center (NRCC) intends to negotiate and award a sole-source contract to Cross Match Technologies, Inc.  to provide the Army with a proof of concept design to replace the current state of the science f or fingerprint recognition devices with an a technology that includes a benchmark model which is reduced in size (portable), with greater ruggedness, and captures higher quality images over a wider range of environmental conditions.  The Government's goal is to meet FBI standard/specification Automated Fingerprint Identification System Image Quality Specification.  The designated NAIC Code is 334119, Other Computer Peripheral Equipment Manufacturing  (1,000 employees) for this effort.  Cross Match Technol ogies, Inc. is classified as a small business for this NAICS code.  In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c and FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.   This determination is based on evalua tion of capability statements received in response to pre-solicitation notice W912SU08072006 dated (07 August 2006) as well as market research.  This notice does not obligate the government to award a contract.  Questions regarding this pre-solicitation no tice may be directed to the point of contact listed.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) webpage located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) seeks to obtain market research information from sources capable of fully satisfying information from government, academia, and industry sources regarding novel solutions for the tanker protective system.  The immediate objective is to survey and assess the most advanced Penetration Resistant Coupons to prevent leakage from tanker assets after ballistic impact from 0.50 caliber AP projectile impacting at 100 ft/sec above muzzle velocity. This market research is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind.  Any information received, in whole or in part, may be used to create the resulting acquisition strategy for the proposed requirements.  Responders will not be reimbursed for any information received and are encouraged not to provide proprietary data or business sensitive information as any information received may be used by the Government and/or released to the public.  The Government is primarily focused on seeking suitable commercial and non-developmental items or commercial items that can be easily modified to meet existing Government requirements.  If no such commercial/non-developmental items currently exist, the Government may entertain the procurement of developmental items based on the information received as a result of this market research.   1.0 PENETRATION RESISTANT COUPON  The following are design and manufacturing parameters NSWCDD will consider during assessments: a) Each company selected will provide an armor solution which must incorporate steel substrates (plates will be 18” x 18” with a thickness of 0.608”). There will be no standoff distances between armor and substrate. b) Three plates will be provided to each company. c) Each coupon will be fired at three times within a 6” diameter circle using a 0.50 cal AP round impacting at 100 ft/sec greater than muzzle velocity. d) The three coupons will be tested at Ambient Temperature (AT), 130 deg F and –40 deg F. i) Test coupons will be placed within a temperature conditioning unit 10 hrs prior to testing, ensuring thermal equilibrium at each required temperature. ii) After each bullet impact plates will be inspected for complete penetrations. A complete penetration at any part of the testing cycle will constitute failure. (A complete penetration will include any impact that compromises a tanker wall to fail prematurely). e) Any solution that incorporates ceramic tile will only be shot at triple points (weakest points). For each solution that meets the performance requirements, further consideration will be given in the following areas: Weight, Ease of Application, Maintainability, Availability 2.0 PLAN OF ACTION & MILESTONES NSWCDD will conduct the Penetration Resistant Coupon evaluation in accordance with the following Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M): 2.1 RESPONSE SUBMITTAL Information in response to this inquiry will be accepted from the date of the synopsis through 30 September 2006.  Responses shall address the parameters identified in Paragraph 1.0.  It is acknowledged that substantive data for emerging technologies for through evaluation of every parameter may not be available; however, all relevant information from responders shall provide a list of materials associated with their armor and corresponding Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).  Responses are limited to 10 pages, not including the material list and MSDS. 2.2  ASSESSMENT NSWCDD will assess the information received in response to this inquiry based on the criteria outlined in Paragraph 1.0 during the period 30 September through 31 October 2006.  Upon completion of this assessment, NSWCDD will select a Penetration Resistant Coupon as having the greatest potential for performance testing. 2.3  TEST SAMPLE DELIVERY  For those coupons selected for performance testing, the Government will send 3 substrates to the selected companies to apply their armor by 5 October 2006. The government will request delivery of samples to be delivered during the period 10 October  to 20 October 2006, at no cost to the government, Penetration Resistant Coupons in the sizes, configurations, and quantities as described above (see Paragraph 1.0).   2.4  PERFORMANCE TESTING The test samples provided will be subjected to the performance testing during the period 23 October to 31 October 2006.  This performance testing will include, but may not be limited to, the following: Type	     Threat     Test round     Velocity    Penetration  Ballistic	0.50 cal. AP ROUND 100 ft/s > muzzle Resistant  Test Type V0 (3 round) All test to be conducted at 0-degree impact obliquity at temperatures -40 F, AT, and 130 F. Access to Penetration Resistant Coupons test results is contingent upon the classification of the results as determined by U.S. Army Research Laboratory. Sources capable of fully satisfying the above requirements should submit capability statements/expressions of interest providing the Government the necessary information to determine actual capability.  At a minimum, this information should include:  1) identification of your company or organization, 2) your company’s or organization’s assertion of existing, full capability to meet proposed requirements, 3) business/contracts/marketing office point (s) of contact information, 4) notification of business size and/or special status and 5) any additional information that may be useful to the successful procurement of the requirements, if solicited.  These expressions of interest shall adhere to a two (2) page submission limit, plus commercial marketing information or web links and all should be sent to XDS11C, via email at dlgr_nswc_xds11@navy.mil.  These should be submitted on or before 30 September 2006.  This market research announcement should not be considered a commitment!   of any kind by the Government and individual correspondence should not be expected in advance of any resulting pre-solicitation notice for the proposed requirements. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Dahlgren Laboratory Procurement Division has implemented Electronic Commerce (EC) in the acquisition area; therefore, this synopsis will be available on the World Wide Web at http://www.nswc.navy.mil/supply. DoD will no longer award contracts to contractors not registered in the Central Contractors Registration (CCR) database. Registration may be accomplished by accessing the CCR Web site at http://www.ccr.gov. A paper registration form may be obtained fro the DoD Electronic Commerce Information Center at  1-888-227-2423.

Description

The US Air Force Air Mobility Battlelab is exploring commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) technologies related to the detection and location of defects in aircraft wiring using least intrusive methods possible to minimize the need for destructive inspection methods which require the removal of wiring harnesses.
The system must be rugged and self-contained, with a size and weight which allows for operability, maintainability, and transport by one technician in austere and/or poorly lit environments without the need for special tools.  It should allow batteries to be removed and replaced by the user and be able to upload and download data to external devices.  It should accurately detect the location of defects, to include opens, shorts, and resistance and capacitance values in wiring harnesses on C-130, C-17, C-5, KC-135 and KC-10 aircraft, without the need for a reference wire.  It is desirable that it detect chafing, nicking, cracking of insulation and the ability to be field calibrated.  The system should not require the use of hazardous and/or environmentally unacceptable materials, unless there is no feasible alternative.

<DESC>Request for Information. This is a research and development project.  The US Army is proposing a solar energy project at Ft. Bliss, TX under the 2005 Energy Act through an Energy Savings Performance Contract (ESPC).  This contract will be based on a prototype technology that extra cts power from low power, variable power sources such as solar panels.  Phase I of the project will be an installation of solar panels producing approximately 1.5 Megawatts of power for use in peak shaving, with follow-on installations of increasing amount s.  Funding will only come from energy savings. All sources that have been previously certified by either the Department of Energy or the US Army Corps of Engineers to receive an ESPC contract may respond.  The Corps of Engineers will negotiate the overhead rate with the prime vendor if a contract award  is made.  Manufacturing and installation of the solar panels and funding may be arranged by the government but could be negotiated for performance by the prime vendor.  The use of the prototype technology, both for power extraction and control systems, is  not negotiable.   Public utilities or power generating electrical cooperatives may respond.  If the Corps of Engineers decides to award to a utility or cooperative, it will be on a sole source basis with the same negotiation positions as previously stated. The proposed technology, which is mandatory for use, is a power extraction technology that extracts more energy from solar panels than the panels normally produce under outdoor environmental conditions.  The increase in power generation from this technolog y is expected to be at least 40% above normal power levels.  The control technology is internet based and is expected to provide a high level of efficiency in control and monitoring of performance.   This project anticipates that the Phase I pilot for 1.5 Megawatts will validate the proposed technology for a period of approximately six months.  Phase II will involve an installation up to 20 Megawatts, depending on the ability of the energy savings to m ake the power production economical.  Phase III, up to 40 Megawatts, will depend on the arrival of additional military units at Ft. Bliss and economic viability.  Phase IV will generate additional levels of power with the intent of providing it to other mi litary installations for their peak power shaving needs. The technical point of contact for this action is LTC Ron Tudor, United States Army Reserves, ron.tudor@us.army.mil at 831-656-3254.  The contracting officer for this action is Nora Cherry, Nora.L.Cherry@nwk02.usace.army.mil at 816-389-3811. Contract Specialist is Monica Moody, Monica.A.Moody@nwk02.usace.army.mil at  816-389-3844.  All interested sources should contact Ron Tudor by email and cc Nora Cherry not later than Monday, 16 October 2006 for Industry Day Agenda.   Industry Day will be held at Ft. Bliss, TX on 17 October 2006.  During this time, you will view the installation s ites and view a demonstration of the technology.

The system required to meet FCC Butner's need  is a system that is fully  compatible with the Varian Eclipse system utilized at the Federal Medical Center.  The Scanditronix System is the only known windows based system on the market today. The Scanditronix System allows the operator full control of the data compiled and easy manipulation of data for file naming, cutting and pasting data from one document to another, and exporting to a wide variety of other report generating programs and spreadsheets. Utilizing this system will aid in maintaining and improving overall patient care by enabling more proficiency in performing the equipment quality insurance inspections.  This also in turn helps improve patient care by enabling the physicists to develop more effective reports for data trending and analysis and reducing the possibility of errors.  This is also the only known system compatible with all standard personnel computers which eliminates the need for more expensive computers and operating systems. This compatibility  helps to reduce costly down time associated with the need to repair specialized computers and equipment.

FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. The following FAR clauses in paragraph (b) of FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, will apply: 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, 52.232-34. The full text of a FAR clause may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far. CCR Requirement - Company must be registered on Central Contractor Registration (CCR) before an award could be made to them. If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. The software provider is to provide server based multi-voting OCR software, technical support via telephone and Web, software upgrades and new releases The Bureau of Human Resources purchased the PrimeOCR server software as a custom software application to allow the US Department of State’s promotion boards application to create PDF Image + Hidden Text files from current imaged TIF files. Follow-on annual maintenance is required to provide the Bureau authorized licensing, support and updates to the software. The maintenance support and licensing authorization remains with Prime Recognition of Woodinville, WA. The HR Bureau's Integrated Personnel Management System (IPMS) is utilized throughout the Department to manage all human resource requirements, worldwide.  The major components are the Global Employees Management System (GEMS), HR Online, the HR Bureau Knowledge Center, and the Post Personnel System.  As part of HR Online, the promotion board’s online application is used by Department of State HR/PE board members each year to review Foreign Service candidates for possible promotion. Many of the features used by Adobe Acrobat by board members require images to be in PDF Image + Hidden Text format. The PrimeOCR application by Prime Recognition facilitates that conversion to this format. Considering the importance of the promotion board’s online application to the Department of State, HR/EX feels the software fee and maintenance fee is fair in comparison to processing PDF images under the old ad-hoc workstation process.  HR/EX considers HR Online and its applications as a mission critical element to supporting the Bureau’s program in support of the Department worldwide

CCR Requirement - Company must be registered on Central Contractor Registration (CCR) before an award could be made to them. If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. ).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of Dell PowerEdge 2850 Servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements and the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ systems environment and visa generation requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another manufacturer or company.CA/CST has identified the Dell PowerEdge 2850 Servers as the optimal mid-sized platform to meet the inventory needs of Domestic Operations Infrastructure Support Services.  The introduction and use of dual core technology is deemed essential to the successful conduct of the Technical Briefing Lab as it is the most cost effective means of enabling the Bureau to increase processing speeds by more than 50%.  The processors will provide extra caching capabilities and the additional memory will enhance the Bureau’s ability to maintain operational status in the event of unexpected memory failures.  The Dell PowerEdge servers w/dual core Intel Xenon processor and Blade servers were judged to offer the most power and redundancy of any server of its class, and was determined to be best suited to support the Technical Briefing Lab. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements. The recent request to migrate all NT servers to 2003 and other application requirements has consumed Domestic Operations Infrastructure Support Services current server inventory, therefore requiring them to ask for additional server hardware.  In order to meet their current operational requirements, and with the delay in the install of drops and power to the Technical Briefing Lab, all the requested equipment is necessary to replace the Technical Briefing Lab’s current servers. The Dell server equipment was selected for this purpose because results obtained by the Bureau’s Systems Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturer’s servers indicated that it most closely met the Department of State’s throughput, processing and redundancy requirements. It has been approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and is being added to the Consular HW Baseline.   The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which, in the interests of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration, has established an environment comprised solely of Dell HW.  The continued use of Dell servers obviates the need to procure, maintain and account for spare parts inventories for multiple HW manufacturer’s server configurations or to manage multiple vendor’s out years support and maintenance agreements.  Since this equipment is required to meet operational requirements by replenishing depleted inventory, CA/CST/DO must take physical possession of this HW as soon as possible.   Even if another manufacturer’s equipment identical to the Dell PowerEdge2850 in terms of specifications, configuration and functionality were to become available at this juncture, they could not be evaluated and baselined in time to ensure that they would be requisitioned, competed, obtained, and otherwise readied for use by September of this year.

BIDS MUST BE VALID FOR 30 DAYS AFTER COMPETITION CLOSE. FOB DESTINATION CONUS This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of HP ProLiant DL360 G5 & ML350 G4p servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.The HP ProLiant DL360 G5 & ML350 G4p servers have been identified as key components of the Department’s networking system, with the optimal configurations to meet CA/CST/TI’s IV&V projects needs.  These servers will be used for production readiness and performance testing of CA software systems using high-end performance testing software provided through IBM-Rational.  Therefore, the specs presented herein as recommended by IBM-Rational, must be met or exceeded in order to support the 10,000-user test bed in stress and load testing scenarios.  Failure to met or exceed the specifications would limit software testing, which could lead to failure of fielded CA software during periods of international crisis.  The HP DL360 G5 & ML350 G4p servers meet the following project requirements above and beyond other tested server options.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the HP ProLiant DL360 G5 & ML350 G4p servers because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ servers indicated that these most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration.  The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers’ server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ yearly support and maintenance agreements.   The HP ProLiant DL360 G5 & ML350 G4p servers have been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and will be added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The HP DL360 G5 and ML350G4p have undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.

FOB DESTINATION CONUS The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Diplomatic Telecommunications Services – Program Office (DTS-PO).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Cisco switches.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. DTS-PO has identified the Cisco 3750 Switch as a key component of the Program Office’s global transport network enterprise network management networking system. Equipment listed above is required to provide network connectivity within existing DTS-PO enterprise network infrastructure based on existing management tools and routing capabilities that requires two critical protocols supported only by Cisco network switches; HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol).  These switches are going to be aggregated with existing 3750-series switches using a Cisco proprietary interconnect cable, to add additional ports to a single logical switch. No other manufacturer’s equipment meets these requirements. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The Cisco 3750 Switch has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the DTS-PO IT Configuration Control Board, for installation within the DTS-PO-managed DoS Black Router Network / DTS1 transport network and the management subnets.

<DESC>Sole Source, Dewetron Inc, Charlestown, RI, CA, Side-Hand DA-130 Series Ruggedized Notebook Computer System  This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a  Request for Quotations (RFQ) for: 1.  Model No: DA-138, Dewetron Side-Hand DA-130 Series Battery-powered Indutrial MIL-STD notebook computer (6 Each)  2.  Model No: SCSI-29160 PCI SCSI Controller. Adaptec ASC-29160 or compatible to include installation, integration, and test (6 Each) Dewetron Inc is the prime distributor of the newly introduced DA-130 Series Side-Hand Battery-Powered Industrial MIL-STD Notebook Computer.  This item is required by the ELV Launch Services Program (LSP) to provide enhanced telemetry data recording / receiving functions to existing HEIM data recorders deploying at remote locations (e.g. enhanced data recording control and expedite data transfer functions) for all ELV launches. The DA-130 provides unique design features and performance capabilities necessary to meet the LSP mission. The LSP performance requirements are met with the following distinctive features: proprietary SideHAND, hot-swappable battery replacement (battery-powered with no interruption to processing for 2 to 3 hours), full-length full-sized PCI slots (vendor installed Adaptec SCSI-29160 PCI card), ruggedized all-metal chassis (MIL-STD 810F), bright LC with touchscreen (450 c/m2), powerful upgradeable motherboard (Intel Core Duo 2GHZ).	This ruggadized notebook computer being procured will be used in conjunction with NASA’s current systems; specifically, it is compatible and allows integration into the existing HEIM data recorders.  NASA KSC has performed extensive research into possible vendor sources for this type of notebook computer, and has determined that Dewetron Inc., Charleston, RI, is the only vendor that offers equipment which meets the mission needs.   Dewetron is the only vendor that offers this one of a kind notebook computer with its proprietary hot swap, battery power system, full-length, full-size PCI Slot which fits a wide range of PCI cards for computing aerospace & engineering applications, replaceable motherboard (reduces replacement costs of other disposable designs), and a powerful processor to run high-end data analysis software. The LSP mission requires a notebook computer with this advance technology.  Purchasing any other notebook computer would entail design and development costs to integrate with existing NASA systems, not meet mission needs, and would represent an unacceptable technical risk to KSC.    The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 2005-12 This procurement is a total small business set-aside. See Note 1.  The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 334119, 1000 employees respectively.  The offeror shall state in their offer their size status for this procurement.

IRM/OPS/MSO/EML has identified the Secure Computing products as a key component of the Department’s OpenNet Everywhere (ONE) networking server farm.  The equipment listed above is required to support the system expansion and future growth of the ONE program.  The Secure Computing FOB devices allow two factor authentications when accessing the ONE servers from remote locations. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s ONE networking infrastructure.

JUSTIFICATION:  

This acquisition is proprietary in nature.  The procurement items are to replace/upgrade existing Common Access Control (CAC) Readers and install additional units.  ADT Security Services originally installed in 1998 the existing and operates 100% of the equipment and support.  All additions and upgrades to our security/surveillance system must be supplied and installed by ADT Security Services to maintain continuity during the transition period, as they are the only authorized distributor of the OEM (Northern Computers) in the San Antonio area for this type of equipment. Additionally, the cost associated with a different company installing a new system would void existing ADT warranties and not be in the best interest of the government or Randolph Air Force Base.  In view of the fact that we are currently leasing ADT equipment and services, any attempt to have another contractor perform services on this equipment would also void existing warranties through ADT Systems, and the government would needlessly incur additional expenses.  ADT Security Systems was the installing contractor of the Central Control System and is the only source that can link all of Randolph?s secured buildings into the main controller without voiding existing warranties.  The installation and related equipment to upgrade the existing CAC readers and add additional readers are fully covered against labor and manufacturers defect for a period of one (1) year.  


CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Award will be made using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Evaluation procedures in FAR Part 13.106-2 will be utilized.

0001 Introducing the EVD 2500 Portable
Explosives Detector from Scintrex
Trace, the most experienced designer
and maker of advanced explosive and
narcotic detection systems in the
world.
Operating the EVD 2500
EVD 2500 is the lightest and most rugged
portable vapour trace explosives detector
from Scintrex Trace. It detects a range of
explosive vapours, including difficult
ICAO taggants, and is the easiest to
operate. Ready in less than a minute, it
reads out in 15 seconds. The latest
upgrades in sample collection and
processing techniques make it the most
sensitive and economical unit available
worldwide.
EVD 2500 is flexible, easy to
operate without any radioactive
source, consumable, or carrier
gas. Vapours are sampled via the
sampling nozzle. EVD 2500 gives
go/no go results in just seconds
by LCD and volume-adjustable
audio alarm, making detection a
simple one step process.
&#10145; Portable: EVD 2500 is selfcontained,
rugged, and lightweight
(less than 3.0 kg) and
battery operated.
&#10145; Ready for Use: Ready to use
within a minute of power-up.
Simple push-button automatic
operation with go/no go readouts.
&#10145; Better Value: Less costly to
budget and operate, placing
more units in the field. No
consumables, radition or
calibrations, licenses or
certificates to contend with.
&#10145; Proven: EVD 2500 uses the
same proven sensor technology
as EVD 3000. Far superior to
long obsolete ?sniffer? makes.
&#10145; Sensitive and Selective: EVD
2500 can detect even minute
vapour traces of Dynamite,
Nitroglycerine, ICAO taggants,
tagged plastique and other
explosives, improvements have
resulted in greatly increased
sensitivity and battery life.
EVD 2500
Portable Explosives Vapour Detector

0002 ETK (Explosives Testing Kit) - A portable micro-laboratory for rapid detection of explosives.

At these times when terror strikes all over the world we are in a desperate need to find a solution to locate those explosives that threatening our lives. Developed by the best chemistry scientists in the world, the ETK is a simple, very smart and cost effective system that can help us fight those who are trying to harm us by detecting the origins of the explosives and prevent future disasters from happening. My vision is to place an ETK kit in every police car, any airport and any agent who is in the field trying to protect us. That small ETK kit can save many people's lives, that's a fact.

This portable micro-laboratory, with its sensitive, simple, rapid, precise and reliable operation, revolutionizes the field task of police and other security agencies in the detection and identification of explosives.

ETK can detect ALL kind of explosives and was expended to detect the improvised explosive TATP.

The major areas of activities involve development of biologically active compounds, organic synthesis and scale up, development and validation of analytical methods, pharmacological testing of chemicals and development of animal models.

Functional Considerations	
Standard Deployment:	The BIS-WDS? Prime can be deployed both indoors and out.
Outdoor deployment:	The system should be deployed so that both the camera and the target being imaged are underneath a cover. This is to minimize environmental/sky change interference including rain getting between the image target and the camera.
Indoor deployment:	In an indoor scenario, room temperatures should not regularly exceed 80?F/26?C.
Other Deployment Considerations:	Traditional CCTV deployment considerations apply, as the camera contains a full-motion video component that enables the identification of the person with the threat and location of that threat on the person's body.
	
Features	
Object detection capabilities:	Objects detected by the camera can be made from metal or the types of plastic, ceramic and composite materials commonly used in weapons or many types of explosives. These items contrast with the human body.
Object classification capabilities:	The system attempts to classify objects that are large enough to potentially be an explosive.
Parallel processing technology:	Multi-threaded software application executes simultaneous instructions in parallel, providing high reliability with no system performance degradation.
Number of objects processed simultaneously:	Unlimited detections processed. System will display 3 threats at a time on the GUI, and has a running detection and classification event log. Events in the log are contiguous and can only be "cleared" by a system administrator.
System Imaging Speed:	Indoor: 4 FPS
Outdoor: 10 FPS
Object detection indication:	On the subject, a tri-colored box is displayed. The box has black as the outside line, white as the middle line and one of the following colors as the inside line:
?	Blue: For "D2" level detection 
?	Yellow: For "D1" level detection (highest confidence)
Object detection indication in the form of the same type of tri-colored box also appears in the "Detection Status" area of the GUI with the "D1" and "D2" indication displayed inside the box.
Object shape classification indication:	On the subject, a tri-colored box is displayed. The box has black as the outside line, white as the middle line and red for the inside line.
Object shape classification indication in the form of the same type of tri-colored box also appears in the "Detection Status" area of the GUI with an "L" classification icon, indicating a very large object.

Technical Proposal: The offeror shall submit a technical proposal that documents the marine qualifications, as they relate to the technical qualifications above, of the Pipefitter Workers/Lead Pipefitters that they commit to supply under any resulting contract.  A proposal that merely states that the workers will meet all the requirements of the solicitation may be determined technically unacceptable.    Any offer submitted shall include details of the types of experience, including marine experience, for each proposed/committed Pipefitter Worker/Lead Pipefitter.  The proposal shall also include details that confirm that the offeror is capable of supplying, at a minimum two (2) and up to eight (8) qualified Pipefitter Workers and a Lead Pipefitter within six (6) days of receipt of the delivery order.  Past Performance: Offeror shall supply at least one (1) relevant marine shipyard recommendation for past performance evaluation purposes.

These are estimated hours only and are not a representation to an offeror or contractor that they will be required or ordered, or that conditions affecting requirements will be stable or normal.  Conditions may change and there may be a need for significantly less or more hours.    Proposed rates shall be fixed and shall remain fixed throughout the period of performance.  Pipefitter Workers/Lead Pipefitters shall be entered into the Coast Guard YARD?s Time & Attendance system for tracking purposes only.    All services provided over eight (8) hours per day/forty (40) hours per week shall be considered overtime.   On days of inclement weather, contractor shall call the Coast Guard Inclement Weather Hotline at (410) 636-7910, Option 1.

In the event that the contractor reports to the YARD and is sent home (inclement weather, no work, etc.), contractor shall receive a minimum of two (2) hours compensation at the standard rate at which they are authorized under the agreement.   FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) and the following addenda:  FAR 52.217-5 Evaluation of Options.  Proposal Evaluation: The Government will evaluate all offers to be qualified for award as follows: If it is determined in the best interest of the Government, the Government reserves the right to make more than one award in response to this solicitation.    The Government will review each proposal submitted in response to this solicitation and make award to the offeror who submits the best proposal for supplying personnel with the qualifications listed above.    The Government will consider price as a factor in the evaluation, but the contractor?s technical qualifications and capability to provide a number of Pipefitter Workers/Lead Pipefitter are more important.    Past Performance information will also be considered.  The experience will be evaluated for its relevancy and should be recent.    Firms lacking a record of relevant past performance history, or for whom information on past performance is not available, shall receive a neutral evaluation.  Marine shipyard experience is required.  Proposals not meeting this requirement may be determined unacceptable.  The evaluated price will be obtained by multiplying the estimated number of hours times the relevant labor category for the base year and each option year.  The labor category totals for the base year and each option year will then be added together to achieve a final price for evaluation purposes.   Price evaluation will be performed by the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of each proposed price and to determine the Offeror?s understanding of the work and ability to perform the contract.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

Disaster Operations Specialists (DOSs) play a central role in the U.S. Government's (USG's) disaster response, humanitarian assistance, and disaster risk management programs.  They assist in developing response strategies, in managing all aspects of grants for humanitarian donor organizations, and in preparing talking points, information products, and briefing material.

INTRODUCTION

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance. DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

DOSs are part of the Disaster Response Team within DRM.  This team consists of five regional groups, each covering the following areas: Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia (EMCA), Asia and the Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean (ASIA/LAC), Southern, Western and Northern Africa (SWAN), East and Central Africa (ECA) and Sudan.  Each regional group is managed by a Regional Coordinator.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is RA1341-06-RP-0118 and is being issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-09.  The NAICS code is 334519 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  This procurement is Full and Open Competition.  Any amendment(s) hereto will only be published on the Federal Business Opportunities website.  

GENERAL STATEMENT

The Materials Reliability Division (MRD) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a need for an instrument for making measurements known as Instrumented Indentation or Nanoindentation. In these measurements, a precisely-shaped diamond point or tip is applied to the surface of a material to be characterized. The force and displacement are recorded. The resulting record is analyzed to deduce values of the elastic modulus and hardness of the material. Modern microelectronic devices and the new nanotechnology rely on very small material bodies with distinct material properties. For example, in microelectronics, thin metal films on silicon wafer substrates often have thicknesses of 500 nanometers or less. The required instrument shall provide the appropriate range and resolution of the force and displacement measurement and control apparatus and systems, including hardware and software, to provide scientifically and technically useful characterization of such materials. Displacement sensitivities measured in picometers (1 meter divided by 1 followed by 12 zeroes) and force sensitivities in the nanoNewtons (1 Newton divided by 1 followed by 9 zeroes) are sought. The need is for a top-of-the-line, research-grade instrument.

Clearly measuring and controlling such small forces and displacements requires apparatus carefully designed and constructed for stability and vibration-isolation. Useful scientific studies of materials often require control of the location where the indenter tip is applied to the surface, so that special features such as grain boundaries or grain interiors in metals can be studied. It is expected that any instrument purchased under this request for proposals will be equipped with a system for at least high-resolution optical imaging of the specimen surface before and after the indentation. NIST is interested in the capability of a contractor to provide advanced imaging capability, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), as a field upgrade to the Nanoindenter.

Tests are performed under computer control; it is expected that any instrument purchased under this request for proposals will be equipped with a computer and the needed software and accessories necessary to perform the tests and provide full documentation, including force-displacement records and deduced elastic modulus and hardness values. The computer shall be fully compatible with the on-site computer network (see item #11).

A complete instrument ready for use is sought; the instrument should be capable of being demonstrated upon receipt, by testing a specimen supplied by the manufacture or by NIST.  

Due to the unavailability of funds, NIST intends to purchase only the baseline Nanoindentation System, but requires the option to upgrade the system if funding should become available.  Additionally, the baseline instrument shall be a stand-alone piece of equipment, not an add-on attachment to another piece of equipment.

Because apparatus of the type sought has been sold commercially for some years now, NIST wants to be sure that it is purchasing an instrument that has the advantages of commercial experience built in. Therefore NIST has included some conditions to assure itself that the contractor is capable of supplying a highest-quality, research-grade instrument.

General Conditions

•	Equipment shall be a current year production model and not a prototype or one-of-a-kind system. There shall be at least 5 working units of the proposed make and model operating currently in the field.
•	The temperature and vibration stability of the laboratory environment that is required to allow the instrument to meet its specifications shall be stated. Required utilities such as electrical power, compressed air, and running water shall be specified and shall be within the capabilities of a typical research laboratory environment.
•	Upon request, the contractor shall provide a demonstration to a representative of NIST, at a date and time to be agreed upon, at some location within the continental USA, of an instrument that meets the specifications as offered in the proposal prior to award of the contract.

•	The Contractor shall provide at least a one year warranty.

•	The Contractor is notified that the instrument will not be accepted, and will not be paid for, until after verification of the equipment capabilities.  The verification testing will commence at the end of on-site installation and training.  It is anticipated that the acceptance testing period will have a duration of 3 weeks.  If adjustments to the equipment are needed to enable it to meet its specifications, the acceptance testing period will be extended accordingly.

•	The contractor shall have sufficient instrument service and repair capability accessible to NIST Boulder, so that repairs can be completed with a turnaround time of one week or less in the absence of unusual circumstances.

•	The contractor shall provide a minimum of one (1) day on-site installation and one (1) day on-site training.

•	Delivery shall be F.O.B. Destination (Boulder, CO) and shall occur within 90 days or less from receipt of contract award.

EVALUATION CRITERIA

Critical items for Baseline Instrument

1. Force Sensitivity, resolution, precision and accuracy.  The basis for the specifications offered, e. g. traceability or use of standard measurement methods and specific reference specimens, shall be documented. A practical application of such an instrument’s force sensitivity is the minimum detectable contact force. A specified value of the minimum detectable contact force, including documentation of how the value was obtained, is of interest. The practical force sensitivity is limited by the noise floor of an instrument. The noise floor of the instrument offered, defined as the smallest physically significant change in force that can actually be measured by the instrument, is of interest. Specification of the force noise floor should include documentation of the conditions under which it was measured; in particular, NIST would like to know what quality of laboratory environment, in terms of temperature and vibrational stability, is needed to achieve the specified values. Relevant quantities would include the upper limit of the rate of ‘drift’ of the indicated force value with time, the averaging time used externally or built into the instrumentation to achieve this value, and the frequency dependence of the force ‘noise’. 
2. Force Range.  A range sufficient for indenting metal films is sought. Optional high-force capability is considered a non-priority item. If a “high force” option is available, it should be listed and priced with the optional equipment, because high force is not viewed as critical for this purchase. 
3. Displacement (as used in the force-displacement curve, meaning displacement perpendicular to the specimen surface) sensitivity, resolution, precision and accuracy.  The basis for the specifications offered, e. g. traceability or use of standard measurement methods and specific reference specimens, shall be documented. The practical displacement sensitivity is limited by the noise floor of an instrument. The noise floor of the instrument offered, defined as the smallest physically significant change in displacement that can actually be measured by the instrument, is of interest. Specification of the displacement noise floor should include documentation of the conditions under which it was measured; in particular, NIST would like to know what quality of laboratory environment, in terms of temperature and vibrational stability, is needed to achieve the specified values. Relevant quantities would include the upper limit of the rate of ‘drift’ of the indicated displacement value with time, the averaging time used externally or built into the instrumentation to achieve this value, and the frequency dependence of the displacement ‘noise’. If a correction for “machine compliance” (as discussed in item 5 below) is used to reach the specified value of displacement accuracy during a normal instrumented indentation measurement, a brief statement of how the correction is applied and typical numerical values should be specified. If no such correction is needed, the verification that it is not needed should be documented. A displacement resolution less sensitive than 0.1 nanometer will not receive the full score for this item.
4. Displacement Range, up to a practical limit useful for the required measurements. A useful displacement range of at least 15 micrometers has been recommended by a NIST expert in this area. The useful displacement range of the instrument offered should be specified. 
5. Stability of the indicated displacement value against changes in the imposed force. In instrumented indentation measurements, the relationship between: a) The amount of displacement of the sharp diamond tip into the specimen material; and b) The force applied to produce this displacement, is critical. Under certain conditions this relationship can be expressed as a ‘compliance’, which is defined as a change in displacement divided by the change of the associated force. Depending on the particular design of the instrument, corrections for deflections of parts of the instrument itself that are produced by the imposed force may be necessary, because the ‘raw’ measured displacement value may be the sum of the desired displacement, which is the displacement of the tip into the specimen, and an extraneous displacement contributed by the deflection of the apparatus. These extraneous deflections are termed “machine compliance.” The larger is this quantity, the greater is the possibility of measurement errors. The need for corrections for “machine compliance,” or the absence thereof, should be documented in the proposal; specific methods and reference specimens used for this determination should be documented. In particular, the typical range of values of the “machine compliance” should be documented if it comes into the typical measurement procedure used for instrumented indentation measurements. 
6. Resolution and practicality of the imaging system, of whatever sort, built in to the instrument to preview the specimen surface to be indented and to measure the surface after indentation. An optical system with the capability to record digital still images at magnifications of at least several hundred is considered critical. Practical and workable interoperability of the imaging system with the placement of indents shall be documented. Priority is on capability to preview the specimen and accurately place the test indentations relative to pre-existing surface features (see item #7). NIST is aware of the possibility that this capability, particularly the acquisition and storage of digital images, may not be present on a ‘baseline’ instrument. However, NIST considers this capability to be crucial for a NIST instrument. NIST expects to purchase this capability and its cost will be considered to be part of the base cost of the instrument. 
It is likely that only an optical imaging option will be purchased initially. Therefore, the capability of the system to be retrofitted in the field at some later date with advanced imaging tools such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) will be considered. Sample images of a specimen surface and accompanying documentation of the time required to obtain them, and documentation of relevant other specific conditions of the imaging operation, shall be included with the proposal. Capability for scientifically useful post-indentation measurements of surface displacements is of interest and will be considered. Extra equipment needed to obtain the post-indentation measurement capability shall be listed with the optional equipment. The practicality, including cost, of adding this capability at a later date as a field upgrade should be specified.
7. Placement of test indentations relative to pre-existing surface features. These instruments typically move the specimen between one or more imaging stations and the indentation station. Accurate and reproducible motion is needed to accurately place test indentations relative to pre-existing surface features. The typical placement accuracy of which the instrument is capable shall be specified. If different grades of the specimen support and stationing systems (sometimes called, the moveable table) are available, the performance of the options available shall be specified in quantitative terms. Accuracy of placement within at least 2 micrometers is viewed as critical for the intended use of this instrument. NIST is aware that an optional ‘high-accuracy table’ may be offered by certain vendors. A high accuracy table, relative to its specified placement accuracy, shall be listed as an option.
8. Capability for measurement of mechanical response of the indenter-specimen contact under small force/displacement oscillations superposed on the main load, for sensitive detection of first contact and for measurement of the contact stiffness continuously along the load-displacement curve. This item includes consideration of the resonant frequency of the indenter head; high resonant frequency, up to a practical limit, would be preferred because measurements are made at frequencies well below the instrument’s resonance. NIST is interested in the range of frequencies that can be used for such a measurement, particularly the higher frequencies. NIST is aware of the possibility that this capability may not be present on a baseline instrument. However, NIST considers this capability to be crucial. NIST expects to purchase this capability and its cost will be considered to be part of the base cost of the instrument. Instruments which do not offer this capability will not be considered for purchase.
9. Many specimens of interest to NIST will be mounted on standard SEM (scanning electron microscope) specimen stubs. Typically these have a pedestal with a diameter of 0.5 inch mounted on a stem with a diameter of 0.125 inch. The total height is about 0.5 inch plus a specimen which can be considered to be 0.1 inch thick. The compatibility of the offered instrument with such specimens shall be described.
10. Availability of replacement indenter tips, including the standard Berkovich geometry and non-standard tips such as spherical, cylindrical, square-pyramid, cube corner, etc. shall be documented. 
11. Computer hardware and software supplied as part of the instrument shall be suitable for connecting to the NIST network. Microsoft Windows XP (trademark) is the most widely supported network operating system at NIST.
12.  Items which may not be listed as part of the baseline instrument, but which we consider essential, are:
 a) video imaging, with digital image storage and archiving, of the specimen surface; and
 b) the capability of the instrument to superimpose on the main force small oscillations of 
     force, and record the resulting oscillations in displacement, during an indentation. See 
     critical items 6 and 8 above. 

Lower Priority Optional Items (to be priced separately)
These items may be needed in the future. For the present purchase NIST wants to know about the availability of these items as future upgrades to the instrument.
12. Measurement at temperatures above and below room temperature of interest. Such temperature capability is not of primary interest for this purchase, and shall be listed with the optional equipment. 
13. Horizontal displacement and force control and measurement capability, often used for scratch tests, is of interest, but is not of primary interest. If this capability is offered, it should be priced with the optional equipment. 
14. Control options offered or available as future upgrades: displacement control, force control, and other if any. Advantages of multiple control options, beyond that needed to perform a basic indentation test, should be specifically described.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a request for quote, solicitation number SP3100-6191-9502.  This requirement is set aside for small business; the associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 334310 with a small business size standard of 750 employees.
The Defense Distribution Center located in New Cumberland, PA has a requirement for a contractor to furnish and install an Audio/Visual Presentation System in the Command Control Center (CCC) Conference Room located in Building 81.  
Offerors shall provide a firm fixed price for the contract line items as follows: clin 0001, Equipment -- Offerors shall provide the unit price for each component and the total amount, inclusive of shipping costs (FOB Destination, New Cumberland, PA); clin 0002, Installation of equipment; clin 0003, one year warranty and preventative maintenance; clin 0004 (optional), second year preventative maintenance.  Note: Desired schedule for delivery and installation is 3 weeks ARO; Required schedule for delivery and installation is 4 weeks ARO.

The Scope of Work for this requirement is as follows:
The CCC conference room is approximately 28-feet long by 20-feet wide and is a SECURE ROOM (controlled access).  A 4-foot X 10-foot conference table and 10 chairs are positioned in the center of the room.  Current equipment in the room includes a white board, with three separate sliding panels, comprising most of one wall; six computer desktop workstations located along two adjacent walls; a SECURE (SIPR) and NON-SECURE (NIPR) communications (email) network system, linking the 6 computer workstations previously identified to their respective (SIPR/NIPR) Local Area Networks (LAN); a wall-mounted 19-inch television (which will need to be removed by the Contractor before installation of the new AV equipment) connected to a Cable TV network and a ceiling-mounted visual projector that faces a retractable projection screen along the same wall as the sliding dry-erase white boards noted above.  Ideally, amongst other functionality, the added audio/video display capability being requested in this SOW will supersede (replace) the need to utilize the current video projection and supporting retractable screen currently being employed in the CCC.  There are numerous power outlets throughout the space. The conference room has a standard 8-foot drop ceiling.  A schematic of the space is available from the Contract Specialist POC.
Government responsibilities:
1. Provide access to necessary areas to complete the project during normal business hours (0800 – 1700 M-F)
2. Provide a safe and clean environment for contractor employees and their subcontractors.
3. Provide computer network system, both SECURE and NON-SECURE, to have video display equipment interfaced to.
4. Provide cable TV network to have video display equipment interfaced to.
5. Provide 110V power supply for the following equipment being installed by the contractor

Contractor responsibilities:
The contractor shall provide the capability for the Command Control Center (CCC) to visually display on three separate contractor-provided and installed 60-inch (or larger) plasma monitors, information and or video from existing computer network systems, SECURE (SIPR) and NON-SECURE (NIPR) systems and from an existing cable TV network.  Capability to display this information by these three plasma monitors must also include the ability to display multiple-source data into one plasma monitor simultaneously (minimum of two and maximum of four (quad) displays per monitor) and the ability to switch sources feeding these the monitors instantaneously.  It is anticipated that two of these plasma monitors would be located along the wall where the current retractable projection screen is located and the third screen would be located along a different wall within the same space. Each monitor must also have audio capability (integrated or as a separate speaker system)
The contractor shall also provide the CCC capability to add up to six additional computer workstations at the CCC Conference table, by providing the necessary computer network (both NIPR and SIPR) interface connections, to allow for a “plug and play” type capability and for these added workstations to also be able to feed information and have it displayed to the three plasma monitors, with the same level of functionality as previously described for the already existing computer network workstations. The overarching concept is that a laptop could be placed onto the conference room table and quickly and easily be “plugged” into the existing LANs, and removed just as effortlessly.  
The contractor will provide two audio/visual control systems.  One will be a movable desktop control panel, with the intention of it being used at the conference table, when needed. The second control system will be integrated with a portable podium. The podium should be easily movable (wheels or extremely light weight and be of standard size and configuration. Both systems should be capable of operating independently or in tandem (simultaneously).   
Specific audio/video equipment recommended to be provided and installed by the contractor to achieve the required added functionality includes, but is not limited to, the following:
1. Three 60 inch plasma data display screens (or larger), with a minimum 1024x768 resolution, with depth dimension not to exceed 6 inches, capable of being wall-mounted or ceiling-mounted. Each monitor must also include audio output capability. 
2. Combination S-VHS Hi-Fi VCR/DVD player. Only special requirement for this equipment is that it can be stored properly in equipment rack also to be provided by the contractor.
3. Two portable video control panels.  One suitable for desktop mounting, the other to be part of a portable podium system. 
4. Portable podium with attached/installed video control panel.  Due to size of CCC Conference room, there is no need for a microphone with this podium.  The podium should be easily movable, either on wheels or extremely light weight and be of standard size and configuration 
5. Equipment rack (if required), to house VCR/DVD player, switcher, and any other associated equipment. 
6. Required interfaces, control system, remotes, power switches, switch boxes, cables, connectors and other mounting brackets to install all items identified above.
7. Required interfaces and hardware to support capability of integrating additional six computer workstations on the conference room table, when needed (plug and play) to the existing computer network (NIPR and SIPR).
8. One year warranty and preventive maintenance on entire audio visual system installed by the contractor.
9. Second year preventative maintenance. 
Contractor shall install the audio visual system.  Contractor shall ensure full integration with VTC equipment.  Contractor shall test and align the system.  Labor and programming will include all on-site installation and wiring, coordination and supervision, testing, checkout and training.  Also includes all fabrication, modification, assembly, rack wiring and programming.  All items that are mounted must be able to be remounted if equipment must be relocated in the future to another room.
A site visit will be conducted on Monday, July 17, 2006 at 01:00 PM EDT (1300 EDT).  Contractors interested in attending must provide the following information to the Contract Specialist POC no later than 12:00 PM EDT (1200 EDT) on Thursday, July 13, 2006:
	- Company Name
	- Employee Name
	- Employee Social Security Number
	- Employee Date of Birth
	- Employee State and Country of Birth

The current warranties on these existing Dell items are all set to expire between now and the end of October 2006.  Service plan will need to be renewed through Dell before October 2006, to ensure proper maintenance and service will continue uninterrupted.The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system.

<DESC>A site visit was conducted on July 17, 2006, and contractors were instructed to provide questions by the close of business on July 18, 2006.  The questions and answers that resulted from this site visit are included below.  A revised Statement of Work will be provided via a separate, subsequent Amendment to this Combined Synopsis/Solicitation.  Contractors must refer to the amended Statement of Work for changes to the requirement.

1.  Q: Has it been determined that all three displays will be mounted at the front of the room? A: Yes. 
2.  Q: Will the White boards be removed? Yes.  If so who is responsible for removing them? A: The Government will remove the white boards prior to installation of the audio visual equipment.
3.  Q: Where will the AV equipment Rack reside? A: The rack will be in one of front corners or in the closet. 
4.  Q: Will a new cable path be cut in the floor to the table to accommodate the new video and audio cables or will the vendor provide a cable bundle above the floor to a connection point at the wall?  A: No.  There are two options available: (1) routing cables from the table through the existing conduit pipe, up through the column, through the ceiling space, and down through the wall; and (2) routing cables from the table to the rack.   Per the amended statement of work, please provide pricing for both options.
5.  Q: Will all Video Teleconferencing (VTC) references be eliminated from the scope of work? A: Yes, please see updated Statement of Work
6.  Q: How many cable TV feeds will be required? A: The Government requires that two separate channels shall be viewed simultaneously on the three required plasma screens along with input from the computers located in the room.  At least two inputs (TV or SIPR/NIPR) must be viewable on each plasma at any given time.  A minimum of 6 separate inputs (2 per screen) must be viewable at one time.
7.  Q: How many computer feeds total will be required? (SIPR and NIPR)  A: In accordance with the amended statement of work, the existing 2 SIPR & 8 NIPR feeds must be capable of being viewed on the plasma screens.
8.  Q: Will the DDC allow SIPR and NIPR signals to pass through the same matrix switcher? Since a switcher does not retain information. A: Yes, this is permissible, but with a specific KVM switch…Cybex Switchview SC.  
9.  Q: What time frame will the PO be awarded after a vendor has been selected? A: The contracting office anticipates that an award will be made as soon as possible after receipt of offers and before the end of fiscal year FY06.
10.  Q: Will the government office hours be extended to include nights and weekends to accommodate the quick turn around time? A: It will be considered, please see the Statement of Work for amended delivery schedule.
11.  Q: Has it been determined that the final display technology will be Plasma (Available in 60+ inches, High maintenance, chance for image burn) or LCD (Only available in up to 50 inches, more costly, virtually no maintenance)? A: The requirement is three plasma screens as stated in the Statement of Work.
12.  Q: During the site visit, the computer connectivity at the conference table was specified as NIPR only, though the official solicitation specifies SIPR/NIPR.  Please stipulate the correct LAN connection for these machines. A:  The following existing LAN connections shall be fed to the audio visual system: 6 NIPR at the table, 2 NIPR from the side wall and 2 SIPR from the back wall.  
13.  Q: The desired delivery schedule is slated as desired 3-weeks ARO, required 4-weeks ARO.  As we are coming into a traditionally busy time of the year for AV dealers and manufacturers, we would like for you acknowledge understanding that forces beyond our control could affect the time schedule.  A:  The contractor shall provide the delivery schedule in which they can meet; however, the ability to meet the Government’s schedule is a factor that shall be evaluated.
14.  Q: Under government responsibililities:
The contractor shall provide the capability for the Command Control Center (CCC) to visually display on three separate contractor-provided and installed 60-inch (or larger) plasma monitors, information and or video from existing computer network systems, SECURE (SIPR) and NON-SECURE (NIPR) systems and from an existing cable TV network.     Capability to display this information by these three plasma monitors must also include the ability to display multiple-source data into one plasma monitor simultaneously (minimum of two and maximum of four (quad) displays per monitor) and the ability to switch sources feeding these the monitors instantaneously.     It is anticipated that these plasma monitors would be located along the front wall where the current retractable projection screen is located.  Each monitor must also have audio capability (integrated or as a separate speaker system); the system must allow the operator to remotely select and broadcast audio for any one of the six (6) inputs that are displayed on the three plasma screens, but only one audio signal is required at any given time.
The contractor shall also interface existing four (4) LAN workstations in the conference room table the ability to feed information and have it displayed to the three plasma monitors. The overarching concept is that a laptop could be placed onto the conference room table and quickly and easily be ‘plugged’ into the audio visual system.   
The contractor will provide two audio/visual control systems.     One will be a movable desktop control panel, with the intention of it being used at the conference table, when needed. The second control system will be integrated with a portable podium. The podium should be easily movable (wheels or extremely light weight) and be of standard size and configuration. Both systems should be capable of operating independently or in tandem (simultaneously).       
Specific audio/video equipment recommended to be provided and installed by the contractor to achieve the required added functionality includes, but is not limited to, the following:
1. Three 60 inch plasma data display screens (or larger), with a minimum 1024x768 resolution, with depth dimension not to exceed 6 inches, capable of being wall-mounted or ceiling-mounted. Each monitor must also include audio output capability. 
2. Combination S-VHS Hi-Fi VCR/DVD player. Only special requirement for this equipment is that it can be stored properly in equipment rack also to be provided by the contractor.
3. Two portable video control panels.     One suitable for desktop mounting, the other to be part of a portable podium system. 
4. Portable podium with attached/installed video control panel.     Due to size of CCC Conference room, there is no need for a microphone with this podium.     The podium should be easily movable, either on wheels or extremely light weight and be of standard size and configuration 
5. Equipment rack (if required), to house VCR/DVD player, switcher, and any other associated equipment.  The equipment rack shall be placed at one of the corners in the front of the room. 
6. Required interfaces, control system, remotes, power switches, switch boxes, cables, connectors and other mounting brackets to install all items identified above.
7. Required interfaces and hardware to support capability of integrating the existing computer network: six computer workstations at the conference room table, and the existing computer network workstations (NIPR and SIPR) to the audio visual system.  
8. One year warranty and preventive maintenance on entire audio visual system installed by the contractor.
9. Second year preventative maintenance. 
Contractor shall install the audio visual system.  Contractor shall test and align the system.     Labor and programming will include all on-site installation and wiring, coordination and supervision, testing, checkout and training.

that were posted as Amendment No. 3 on 08/04/06.  The revised Statement of Work follows herein.  The closing date for receipt of proposals remains as 4:00 PM EDT on Wednesday, August 16, 2006.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

This requirement is set aside for small business; the associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 334310 with a small business size standard of 750 employees.
The Defense Distribution Center located in New Cumberland, PA has a requirement for a contractor to furnish and install an Audio/Visual Presentation System in the Command Control Center (CCC) Conference Room located in Building 81.     
Offerors shall provide a firm fixed price for the contract line items as follows: clin 0001, Equipment -- Offerors shall provide the unit price for each component and the total amount, inclusive of shipping costs (FOB Destination, New Cumberland, PA); clin 0002, Installation of equipment; clin 0003, one year warranty and preventative maintenance; clin 0004 (optional), second year preventative maintenance.     NOTE: REQUIRED SCHEDULE FOR DELIVERY AND INSTALLATION IS OCTOBER 31, 2006.  INSTALLATION OF EQUIPMENT SHALL BEGIN ON OR AFTER OCTOBER 1, 2006.  THE DELIVERY DATE MAY BE SHIFTED TO A LATER DATE IF REQUIRED, AT NO ADDITIONAL COST TO THE GOVERNMENT, IF CURRENT OPERATIONS DICTATE (I.E. PROVIDING HURRICANE RELIEF EFFORTS).  THE CONTRACTOR MUST BE ABLE TO BEGIN WORK NO LATER THAN OCTOBER 1, 2006.
The Scope of Work for this requirement is as follows:
The CCC conference room is approximately 28-feet long by 20-feet wide and is a SECURE ROOM (controlled access).     A 4-foot X 10-foot conference table and 10 chairs are positioned in the center of the room.     Current equipment in the room includes a white board with three separate sliding panels (to be removed by the Government prior to installation of the audio visual equipment); six computer desktop workstations located along two adjacent walls; a SECURE (SIPR) and NON-SECURE (NIPR) communications (email) network system, linking the 6 computer workstations previously identified to their respective (SIPR/NIPR) Local Area Networks (LAN); a wall-mounted 19-inch television (which will need to be removed by the Contractor before installation of the new AV equipment) connected to a Cable TV network and a ceiling-mounted visual projector that faces a retractable projection screen along the same wall as the sliding dry-erase white boards noted above.    The audio/video display capability being requested in this SOW will supersede (replace) the need to utilize the current video projection and supporting retractable screen currently being employed in the CCC.     There are numerous power outlets throughout the space. The conference room has a standard 8-foot drop ceiling.     A schematic of the space is available from the Contract Specialist POC.
Government responsibilities:

7. Required interfaces and hardware to support capability of integrating additional six computer workstations on the conference room table, when needed (plug and play) to the existing computer network (NIPR and SIPR).
8. One year warranty and preventive maintenance on entire audio visual system installed by the contractor.
9. Second year preventative maintenance. 
Contractor shall install the audio visual system.  Contractor shall ensure full integration with VTC equipment.  Contractor shall test and align the system.  Labor and programming will include all on-site installation and wiring, coordination and supervision, testing, checkout and training.  Also includes all fabrication, modification, assembly, rack wiring and programming.  All items that are mounted must be able to be remounted if equipment must be relocated in the future to another room.

A: There are already 2 NIPR and 2 SIPR computers in the room on the side and back wall.  The requirement for the existing computers is that their screens/input can be displayed on the plasma screens.  No additional SIPR or NIPR connections are required at the table.   As there are currently LAN connections inside the table, there is no requirement for a switch.  Please refer to the amended SOW for the updated requirement.
37.  Q: Would you like “whiteboard” capability in the control system? (The ability to draw on a touch screen and display it on any monitor/window) A: No
