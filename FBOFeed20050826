<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY – The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate on a SOLE SOURCE basis with The American College of Surgeons, 633 N. St. Clair, Chicago, IL 60611.  The purpose of this project is to continue the development and implementation of the standard trauma care data elements developed by ACS and HRSA during the past two years.  This work will support the HRSA Trauma-EMS Systems Program in the provision of technical assistance to the States in their effort to build effective statewide trauma systems. Data Collection is the foundation for building effective statewide trauma programs.  Data is a principal driver in trauma systems strategic planning and in trauma care improvement.  Trauma data quantifies the magnitude of the injury problem.  Unfortunately, most States do not have a comprehensive trauma registry from which to measure the severity of the problem, costs, and personnel needs. Additionally, it is essential to determine the quality of health care delivered and to evaluate patient outcomes. The result of their work will be a minimum standard trauma care dataset for use on the national level, data definitions, and inclusion/exclusion criteria for trauma care.  These results will be presented to a larger national group for consensus, and ultimate adoption into trauma registries. The use of standardized trauma care definitions will enhance the quality of data in NTDB and other systems.  The further development of online services will increase the usage and distribution of NTDB information. 

 This procurement shall be processed in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions.  The period of performance for this project is 16 months.   In accordance with FAR 13.106-1, a Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is on file. Proposed contractor, The American College of Surgeons (ACS) maintains the only comprehensive national database of injury records, the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB), which contains over 1.5 million trauma cases from trauma centers across the nation.  The NTDB is the only comprehensive database available to trauma centers for benchmarking direct care, complications, length of stay, charges, and patient outcomes.

The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).

<DESC>This synopsis constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) per FAR 6.102; there will be no formal request for proposals (RFP) or other solicitation in regard to this announcement.  Competition is Unrestricted.  Anticipated award date:  November, 2005.  
A.  INTRODUCTION
The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport, Rhode Island (NUWCDIVNPT), in support of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is interested in soliciting participation by both industry and academia in the development of Aluminum Seawater Combustion systems for air-independent underwater applications, including submarines, torpedoes, and Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (UUVs) of various sizes.  
DARPA is presently involved in Phase II of the development of an advanced Hybrid Aluminum Combustor (HAC). It is investigating both fundamental science and technology at the component level for a variety of related energy and power conversion systems and subsystems. DARPA is also looking at the larger multi-component, full-up propulsion system level optimization and technologies required to integrate these novel Hybrid Aluminum Combustors (HAC) into efficient overall underwater propulsion systems. These efforts are focused on maximizing the specific energy and energy density of both the Hybrid Aluminum Combustor (HAC) and the energy density and overall performance of the propulsion system.  Candidate underwater propulsion systems that may benefit from the use of Hybrid Aluminum Combustors include UUVs with concepts of operations as discussed in the Navy’s master plan; a copy of the current UUV Master Plan can be found online at the following URL: http://www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/technology/uuvmp.pdf.
The HAC system technology is a unique compilation of multi-disciplinary advanced technologies; for example, the effective operation of a HAC system will require extensive analysis and understanding of advanced thermodynamics and thermodynamic cycles, multi-phase fluid mechanics, metal/seawater combustion dynamics, radiation/convection/conduction heat-transfer, turbo machinery, gas/liquid/solid separation and handling, materials synthesis and dynamic control systems theory all within the context of system integration and vehicle operations and handling. 
Proposals may be for studies or investigations that can be completed within a year of award, or may be for multiyear efforts as long as each subsequent phase can be funded as individual options with clearly defined milestones and deliverables.  
B.  GOALS
The objective of this solicitation is to develop the full potential of this HAC technology; this can only be accomplished if these disciplines are fully understood and synergistically developed at both the fundamental and system levels.  It will require bringing together multiple experts within the applicable technology disciplines to pursue a tightly integrated research and development program that will ultimately produce an unprecedented major performance breakthrough in energy storage and power conversion for underwater vehicles and weapons, including UUVs.
NUWCDIVNPT/DARPA are seeking participation from two areas of the community:
1.  Entities with established and demonstrated expertise with High Performance combustion and power conversion and expertise with air-independent undersea vehicles (submarines, weapons, UUVs, and devices) capable of accurately assessing the feasibility of and issues associated with the development and manufacture of Hybrid Aluminum Combustors and potential underwater propulsion systems that could benefit from the use of a Hybrid Aluminum Combustor (HAC)  
2.  Entities to conduct independent technical assessments of specific HAC related technologies in an effort to fully understand the specific technical issues in a manner that will enable the best technical system solutions and yield the highest possible technical capabilities of the HAC components and subsystems
1.  Scope of Requirement
Area 1:  For the first category, companies must demonstrate their ability to fully understand the issues involved in bringing an advanced energy storage and power conversion technology from early concept development and demonstration through advanced development, manufacture, integration, operation and maintenance.  The specific energy of the HAC system is targeted to approach 1000 to 1500 Wh/l on a full systems basis for an undersea vehicle with a nominal diameter of 60 inches; such an aggressive number will mandate the use of very advanced manufacturing processes and controls together with the understanding of the use and processing of high strength to weight materials, high temperature materials as well as employing state of the art design for manufacture methodologies and technologies.  The HAC system employs an Aluminum metal/seawater combustor as a heat source for a Rankine cycle air-independent 75 HP power conversion system in a UUV. Companies must have demonstrated the ability to understand the critical component technologies of the HAC system sufficiently well enough to optimize the HAC on a systems basis; this can only be accomplished by the efficient and synergistic integration of subsystem components including metal/sweater combustion chambers, metal fuel storage and feed systems, Rankine cycle turbomachionery, compressors, condensers, gas/solids separators, gas/liquid separators, water management, vehicle weight and trim management, component control and integration, and optimizing energy density against the issues of manufacturability, reliability, safety, maintenance and affordability.
Area 2:  For the second category, NUWCDIVNPT is interested in funding consultants/companies with expertise in specific technological areas of which the HAC system is comprised; expertise is being sought in one or more of the following areas:
•	Aluminum/metallic alloy powder synthesis and processes to produce specific powder grain sizes ranging from 3 to 15 microns; expertise to determine methodologies/processes to synthesize powders with consistent particle geometries/sizes with tight tolerances and low variances; controlling particle size synthesis of 3 microns, 5 microns, 7 microns, 10 microns and 15 microns. 
 Expertise in metal powder storage and handling and dispensing/injecting; Aluminum metal powders ranging in size from 3 micron to 15 micron; agglomeration characteristics and fluidization for dispensing of metal powders at ambient conditions as well as elevated pressures up to 400 psia; Delivery of Aluminum powders at 0.035 lbm/sec; storing, dispensing and handling of a nominal 150 lb of aluminum powder.
•	Expertise to quantify the sensitivity of metal powder combustion dynamics as a function of particle compositions as well as particle size.  Ignition and control of Aluminum powder combustion; Aluminum, Aluminum alloys of Magnesium, oxidizer-coated aluminum powders; optimize combustor designs for efficient, stable and slag free combustion, aluminum/water combustion dynamics, stoichiometry and efficiency based on combustor geometry, pressure, temperature, flow rate, etc.
•	Expertise in gas/liquid (H2/H2O(g)/ H2O(l))separators, cyclonic gas/solid separators, separation of alumina particles (0.8 to 30 microns in diameter) from steam/H2; optimizing cyclonic separators by minimizing pressure drop while maintaining highest possible separator efficiency; design variables and particle size and their sensitivity to efficiency; separating aluminum oxides at an average mass flow rate of 28 lbm/hr from high temperature and pressure steam.
•	Rankine cycle system and component expertise; Steam turbine design, 75 HP, +70,000 rpm nominal, maintaining high efficiency with consideration for ingesting abrasive aluminum oxides entrained in the steam feed; blade erosion and abrasive-resistant materials; maintaining efficiency over a broad turndown ratio of 10:1. 
•	Component integration and system level analysis of HAC system; optimization of system based on individual component performance with consideration towards vehicle integration.
The Government is not interested in funding enhancements to proprietary products that may already exist in the commercial domain.

A tradeoff analysis is a good way to make this comparison and should be supported by theory, simulation, modeling, experimental data, or other sound engineering and scientific practices.  If the offeror has a “new and creative” solution to the problem(s), that solution should be developed and analyzed in this section such that its feasibility can be assessed. 
1.2  Technical Program Summary: This section summarizes the above technical discussion in an orderly progression through the program, emphasizing the strong points of the proposed technical approach, and how the proof of concept will be demonstrated and/or tested.
1.3  Risk Analysis and Alternatives: The proposal evaluator(s) will formulate a risk assessment and it is in the best interest of the offerors to have their own understanding of the risk factors presented.  Critical technologies should be identified along with their impact on the overall program as well as risk mitigation strategies.
1.4 Transition or Insertion Plan: Discuss possible uses/users for this technology development, and suggestions for its production and dissemination.
1.5  References:  Include the basis for, and reference, the findings cited in the technical discussion.
2.0  Special Technical Factors.  In this section, the offeror should describe any capabilities the offeror has that are uniquely supportive of the technology to be pursued.  The following items are offered as possible areas to be addressed.
2.1  Capabilities and relevant experience
2.2  Previous or current relevant R&D work and points of contact
2.3  Related contracts and points of contact
2.4  Facilities/resources
3.0  Schedule.  The schedule represents the offeror’s commitment to perform the program tasks in an orderly, timely manner.
3.1	 Time Line Chart by Task: Each major task identified in the SOW should appear as a separate WBS element on the program schedule.  Technical interchange meetings, demonstrations, tests, etc. should be included in the Time Line.  The Time Line should also indicate the anticipated meeting sites.  
3.2	  Identify Milestones: Describe specific one-time events that would occur during the course of the project that would signify a decision point, government review, demonstration or test, or deliverable.
4.0  Program Organization.  In this section, the offerors should present how they will be organized to conduct this project, and to address difficult technical issues.  Any pertinent or useful information may be included in this section, but a minimum recommended response should address the following:
4.1  Organization Chart(s) with Key Personnel: Include prime offeror and team member organization charts.
4.2  Management and Technical Team: This should specifically identify what tasks will be performed by each party and why each subcontractor or team member, if any, was selected to perform its task(s).
4.2.1  Offeror Responsibilities
4.2.2 Subcontractor(s) or Team Member Responsibilities
4.2.3  Consultant(s) Responsibilities
4.3  Resumes of Key Personnel:  Include the resumes of the Key Personnel, be they offeror, subcontractor, team member, and/or consultant personnel. 
5.0  Appendix(es).  Appendices may include technical reports, published papers, and referenced material.  A listing of these reports/papers, with a short description of the subject matter, is usually adequate.  Do not provide commercial product advertising brochures.  
6.0  Past Performance:  Past performance data for the entity’s five most recent research contracts.  
E.  OFFEROR’S STATEMENT OF WORK.
1. It is the intent of the Government to attach the offeror’s SOW, as written, into the resulting award document.  This will occur only if the offeror’s SOW accurately describes the work to be performed, is enforceable, and is void of inconsistencies.  The proposed SOW must contain a summary description of the technical methodology as well as the task description, but not in so much detail as to make the SOW inflexible.  Do not include any proprietary information in the SOW.
2.  The following is offered as a recommended format for the SOW. Please limit the SOW to a maximum of three (3) pages.   Begin this section on a new page.  Start your SOW at Paragraph 1.0. 
1.0  Objective:  This section is intended to give a brief overview of the technology effort and should describe why it is being pursued, what you are trying to accomplish, and what aspect of this BAA Section A, “Scope of Requirement” is being addressed.
2.0  Scope: This section should include the technology area(s) to be investigated, objectives/goals, and major milestones for the effort. 
3.0  Background: This section includes any information, explanations, or constraints that are necessary in order to understand the requirements.  It may include relationships to previous, current and future operations.  It may also include techniques previously tried and found ineffective. The offeror shall identify appropriate specifications, standards, and other documents that are applicable to the effort to be performed.

4.0  Tasks/Technical Requirements:

4.1  The detailed description of tasks which represent the work to be performed, are contractually binding.  Thus, this portion of the SOW should be developed in an orderly progression and in enough detail to establish the feasibility of accomplishing the overall program goals.  The work effort should be segregated into major tasks and identified in separately numbered paragraphs according to the decimal system as described herein.  Each numbered major task should delineate, by subtask, the work to be performed, deliverables and CDRL items.  The SOW must contain every task to be accomplished.  The tasks must be definite, realistic, and clearly stated.  Use “shall” whenever the work statement expresses a provision that is binding.  Use “should” or “may” whenever it is necessary to express a declaration of purpose.  Use “will” in cases where no offeror requirement is involved; e.g., power will be supplied by the Government.  Use active voice in describing work to be performed.
4.2  If presentations/meetings are identified in your schedule, include the following paragraph in your SOW:  “Conduct presentations/meetings at times and places specified in the award document.”
5.0  Exit Criteria and Deliverables:  Propose criteria for establishing or indicating that a specific milestone or phase has been completed.  List the deliverables that result from that milestone or phase.
6.0  Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) Items:  Submit required information per blocks on DD Form 1423. 
F.  EVALUATION CRITERIA:  
Proposals will be evaluated by a scientific review.  Per FAR 35.016(e), the primary basis for selecting proposals for award shall be technical competence (includes past performance);  importance to NUWCDIVNPT programs; and, funding availability.  Cost realism and reasonableness shall also be considered.  Proposal risk will be individually assessed for the technical, cost, and schedule areas.  Proposal risk relates to the identification and assessment of the risks associated with an offeror's proposed approach as it relates to accomplishing the proposed effort.  Tradeoffs of the assessed risk will be weighed against the potential payoff. (END PART 2 OF 2)

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Space and Defense Power Systems, intends to solicit a proposal and negotiate a sole source contract with Canberra Aquila, Inc. for nine Environmental Continuous Air Monitors (ECAMs) capable of detecting and quantifying the presence of airborne alpha-emitting radionuclides such as 238, 239Pu and 241Am. . The ECAMs are a critical component of the Radiological Contingency Planning effort in support of the planned New Horizons Pluto Space Mission with Special Nuclear Materials on board, which is scheduled for launch in January 2006. The ECAM was initially developed in cooperation with Los Alamos National Laboratory and is specifically designed for the detection of airborne alpha particles in outdoor applications, including emergency response activities.  Relevant ECAM features include solid state detector technology with an alpha air monitor with 1700mm2 PIPS detector, preamp, 4096-channel MCA and embedded Pentium-class computer for collection and analysis of alpha spectra; multiple algorithms for radon reduction to reduce false alarms and improve sensitivity; integrated vacuum blower; remote audio and visual alarms; built in GPS and wireless communications; lightweight, durable, weatherproof enclosure; and a built in cyclone separator which removes larger particles  ( >20ìm aerodynamic diameter) to focus sampling on respirable particles. The ECAM can be monitored and configured via local area network. The ECAM must be compliant with RadNet, a Health Physics communications protocol for Health Physics instrumentation developed by one of DOE’s National Laboratories and needs to be capable with existing plume modeling software used in HOTSPOT, which developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) Code for this requirement is 334519. A fixed price purchase order is contemplated, with delivery within seven weeks of award. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS OR AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, NOR DOES IT RESPRESENT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. Interested parties having all the capabilities to provide the product described above are requested to send in its product specifications and proposed price. Responses MUST be submitted via the Department of Energy Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) at the following internet address: http://e-center.doe.gov no later than 4:00 p.m. on September 30, 2005.

Ablebond 334-1 is the only product that has been tested and approved to support the ICBM PRP program requirements.  This requirement is a follow-on to previous requirements for Ablebond 334-1.   Procurement from sources other than Emerson Cummings would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirement.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
	
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may 
file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of 
the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

All parts and components given to the Coast Guard as new or remanufactured shall have a minimum of 1-year replacement warranty.  The following additional information shall also be provided with the warranty:

Price
Quoter shall complete unit and extended prices for the base and option schedule pages.

Delivery of added items shall continue at the same rate that like items are called for under the contract, unless the parties otherwise agree.   (End of clause)

COMPOSITE LABOR RATE: The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work.  The contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.

(a)	The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:
(1)	direct labor wages and salaries;
(2)	all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;
(3)	other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;

(b)	The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only.  Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above.  This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the contractor's accounting system.  These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.
(c)	The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation.  The Estimated Quantity represents the Government’s best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract.  The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract.  The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the contractor to compensation if not exercised.

HSAR 3052.209–70  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE 
                                   EXPATRIATES (DEC 2003). 
 (a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107–296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity, does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships, which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled, as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>This combined synopsis/solicitation is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce On Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of combined synopsis/solicitation and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command. The pulsed power variable laser system will be purchased on a sole source basis from Spectra-Physics Lasers, Inc. to support several technical areas of interest to NSWCDD and the Navy.  The laser system will be able to radiate at high energy levels at varying wavelengths in order to study wavelength dependent phenomenon that is of interest to the Navy DEW program.  Spectra-Physics pulsed power laser system is the only system, which fully meets the Governments requirements.  The Governments requirements are as follows: a. Tunability.  To fully utilize this capability, the laser system must be tunable from the visible (VIS) portion of the spectrum (440nm - 700nm) through the Near Infra-Red (NIR) portion (1000nm - 2600nm) and into the Mid Wave Infra-Red (MWIR) portion (2900nm - 3200nm).   b. Energy.  The laser system must provide more than 1000 mJ/pulse at 1064nm and at least 10 mJ/pulse of energy in the extended NIR region.  c. Turn-key, OTS product.  The major components of t! he laser system must be a standard Off The Shelf (OTS)/catalog products of the company, not a research and development item built to meet the specifications of this purchase.  The major components include the solid-state pump laser, the solid-state optical parametric oscillator (OPO), and any additional components (or extensions) required for tunability to multiple wavelength selections through 3200nm. In order for the laser system to meet the specified requirements, the major component elements will need to be used in concert.  A practical system necessitates all elements be engineered to work well together. Because these elements are intimately coupled, optimization forces iterative procedures between elements.  Therefore it is required that the laser system be provided from and backed by a single manufacturer that is well versed and is responsible for support of all elements operating as a single unit.  This manufacturer must provide the laser system as a turn-key product! , i.e. a complete and ready to operate laser system upon delivery.  d.  Laser System.  The laser system must have a solid-state pump laser with a solid-state OPO laser. e.  Beam quality.  It is important for this application that the laser system operates with a balance between efficiency and mode quality.  The laser system must use a high quality reflective pump chamber with a gold surface in order to provide the high reflectivity and uniform cross section illumination to ensuring uniform output beam profile (no hot spots).  If the pump chamber is ceramic, for example, the mode quality is sacrificed for efficiency because the lamps are coupled closely to the crystal rod, which leads to non-uniform illumination and thus results in lower quality modes and poor beam propagation.  In addition the gold-coated chamber provides a long lifetime in comparison to ceramic or powder-based chambers, which will degrade over time because of the UV generated by the flash lamp.  In addition! , the laser must utilize a dual rod birefringence compensated oscillator for maximized beam quality and energy, whereby the birefringence induced in the first rod is compensated by the second rod and vice versa.  f. Linewidth.  The pump laser must have Injection Seeding for 0.003/cm linewidth at 1064 nm. The OPO linewidth must be less than 0.20/cm across the entire tuning range.  g. Alignment mode.  The laser must incorporate a standard long pulse mode, in addition to the standard nanosecond pulse output.  The long pulse must measure approximately 200 microsec so that a pulse with reduced peak power levels can be used for safer alignment of down stream optics.   For safety, the laser beam shall be operated in this alignment mode, which turns the Q-switch off and allows the laser to free run at a pulse duration of 200 microsec.  This low energy pulse is 1/20,000 of the Q-Switched peak power of the standard 532 nm green pulse and without changing the beam diameter and divergen! ce.  So alignment of the laser to the experimental apparatus can be performed at a reduced risk of working with a high peak power beam.  In the case of IR only operation, this feature should reduce the peak power by a factor of 15,000. h.  High quality Optics.  There must be optics within the laser system that have optical coatings with high damage thresholds in order to sustain high peak power.  This ensures longer lifetimes of the optics and longer term performance and lowers future maintenance and operating costs.  i.  Laser Protection and Personnel Safety Measures.  The laser must use oil/dust-free stainless steel beam tubes between all optical elements to enclose the entire beam path to add a protective physical barrier against environmental contamination.  The beam tubes must be sealed such that they can be purged for optical surface protection and reduced long component lifetime.  The beam tubes also must offer an added safety barrier that protects the user when the l! aser head cover is off.  Eyewear protective goggles must be available to the correct MPE (Maximum Permissible Exposure) levels as stated in the ANSI eye safety standards for this class of laser system and levels of operation.  j.  Dual pump chamber oscillator design with birefringence compensation.  The compensated oscillator reduces depolarization and improves overall beam quality, especially at higher repetition rates (high average power).  k.  Beam Pointing Stability.  The laser system must maintain beam pointing stability of less than 25 micro rad over an 8-hour period with a temperature variation of (and here)  3 deg C.  The laser system is to maintain position over the course of a day as well as repeat the same position within 30 minutes of turn-on on a day-to-day basis.  The laser system must use real time monitoring and feedback to a fine motion control system (such as piezoelectric transducers).  l.  The Flashlamp.  Changing the Flashlamp should not require the remo! val of the pump chamber from the laser head.  Removing the pump chamber assembly to change the Flashlamp increases the chances of misalignment and contamination of the Nd:YAG rod surfaces.   Also, the Flashlamp must have color-coded lead wires on designating the anode and cathode ends to decrease the chance of installing the Flashlamp backwards.  And lastly, the Flashlamp lifetime should be greater than 40 million pulses to 90 percent of IR power.  m.  Trigger.  Advanced sync pulse generator must provide a pre- or post-trigger pulse with respect to the Q-switch in the range positive 500 nanosec to negative 700 nanosec.   This will provide a convenient pre- or post-trigger pulse with a range of 0 to 500 nanosec with respect to the output pulse.  n.  Computer interface.  PC-based graphical interface software for control of tuning system.  The OPO system must be fully automated including scanning capability. The OPO system must include auto-tracking feedback loops to the tuning!  crystals that can be used to automatically write the standard look-up tuning tables.  The remote module must display both signal and idler wavelength readouts and the have the capability to pre-program several common automated scan ranges.  It also must include full-function remote control module with optional RS-232 /IEEE-488 interface capability.   o.  The OPO cavity.  The OPO cavity must incorporate an unstable resonator design (Unstable Resonator refers to a patented cavity design, not output stability).  This design ensures good beam quality and low divergence, hence the ability to focus to diffraction limited spot sizes.  The design also provides the highest frequency conversion efficiency thus eliminating the need to for potentially damaging high pump fluence.  q.  The OPO crystal.  The OPO crystal must be hard-coated crystal to negate the need for temperature stabilization.  Hard-coated, sealed crystals are protected from moisture and environment without heating.   ! r.  OPO Beam Quality.  The OPO beam profile must be round, not elliptical.  Graphical content must be provided showing the roundness of the beam profile.  s.  Auto-tracking.  The system must have feedback loops that automatically track a small portion of the output of the master oscillator and power oscillator and optimizes the crystal angles to peak the power (while scanning and while static).  This auto-tracking system ensures optimum performance independent of environmental changes (temperature, etc.).  Also, the photodiodes that monitor the output of the master oscillator and power oscillator will provide relative output energies that will be used as a diagnostic.  t.  Infrared Frequency Mixing.  The IR extension system will provide the capability for an external frequency mixing system which can be tuned from 1800 nm to 4200 nm.  This system will automatically interface with the OPO for ease of tuning.  u.  The laser system must have some degree of ease of use and ease ! of transport.  For example, the laser system uses standard Nd:YAG crystal rods for ease of maintenance and replacement and the laser head must have detachable umbilical for ease of transport.   The required items and quantities are: Nd:YAG PRO 230-10 with MOPO-SL; quantity: 1.  Required delivery is within 30 days after date of order under F.O.B. Destination terms.

<DESC>In accordance with Simplified Acquisition procedures, The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Applied Research Program (ARP), plans to procure on a sole source basis, for assay services regarding the Measurement of Serum Vitamin D (25(OH)D) for the Health, Eating, Activity, Lifestyle (HEAL) Study of Breast Cancer Prognosis with the Medical University of South Carolina, PO Box 24808, Charleston, SC  29425.
						
The North American Industry Classification System code is 622110 and the business size standard is $29M.  The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures stated in FAR Part 13. 

The purpose of this project is to assay stored serum specimens for (25(OH)D), using radioimmununoassay in the laboratory of Dr. Bruce Hollis at the Medical University of South Carolina. Vitamin D is an essential nutrient for humans and has been primarily recognized for its important role in prevention of bone diseases, such as vitamin D-related rickets, osteomalacia and age-related fractures.  The HEAL study provides an excellent structure to elucidate the biological mechanisms by which vitamin D may be associated (inversely) with breast cancer prognosis. Assays shall be performed on serum that was drawn at the twenty-four (24) month interview from eligible women making the proposed study very cost efficient.   These women are currently part of the HEAL study where prior data and future data has been and will continue to be collected and processed.  

Dr. Hollis collaborates with the HEAL study investigators and is a leading expert in this technique.  He has 30 years of experience in developing assays for vitamin D and its metabolites including developing the first vitamin D assay that received FDA approval.  The complexity associated with performing these assays requires a high level of expertise.  Other laboratories would not be able either to handle the large number of samples or to achieve the required quality of the analysis; hence, it would be detrimental to the progress of the project to outsource the analysis to another academic laboratory or commercial vendor. 

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above service, and has the support of the above listed partners, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT on September 12, 2005.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or sent via electronic mail to holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  It is the vendors’ responsibility to call 301-402-4509 to insure all questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for two gas-tight, water-tight nitrogen storage cabinets for use in a Class 10 clean room.  NASA/JSC intends to purchase the cabinets from Absolute Control Systems, Inc (Absolute Controls).  The storage cabinets are required to be compatible with an existing storage cabinet previously provided by Absolute Controls.  The cabinets are plumbed into the facility nitrogen lines and bolted to the walls in a Class 10 clean room.  Absolute Controls is the only company with an existing product that fits exactly in the specified space and meets stringent NASA quality requirements. An accurate measure of the Genesis solar wind composition can be compromised by a minimal number of atoms of contaminants.  It is imperative that Genesis specimens be curated in Class 10 clean room conditions and their storage cabinets must be fabricated from certified, high quality materials.  Absolute Controls is uniquely capable of providing gas-tight, water-tight nitrogen storage cabinets that meet NASA requirements for material control and cleanability which the curation of Genesis solar wind samples demands.  Absolute Controls has a substantial amount of experience in fabricating processing and containment cabinets and glove boxes for the nuclear and pharmaceutical industries, industries which require levels of cleanliness and containment that are critical to safety and project success.  Details of surface finish, weld quality, and off-gassing of elastomers are critical to maintaining the Genesis specimens in a pristine manner.  To re-qualify other products would require additional funds, additional schedule for re-testing, and potential re-work that could not be expected to be regained through competition.  Absolute Controls has provided a unique design for water-tight storage with smoothly operating latches which is essential for storage of delicate specimens.  No other company makes a similar size/shape door with a flat interior surface that has been electro polished.  Other companies' products with water-tight door seals have large protruding hinge/latch mechanisms which require lubrication.  These products would not meet NASA requirements because lubricants are not allowed in the cleanroom cabinets. Water-tight storage is essential.  Many companies provide water-tight storage containers; however, they cannot be cleaned to meet NASA requirements and the materials of construction are unacceptable because they shed particles and off-gas molecules onto NASA samples.  Cleanliness is essential to distinguishing solar atoms from earth atoms. One 10-micron sphere of iron from a stainless steel cabinet (one tenth the diameter of a hair) contains 10 trillion iron atoms, which is ten times the number of solar iron atoms collected in a square cm.  For their products, Absolute Controls provides the required extensive documentation of material certifications, leak testing, and personnel skill documentation.	  The cabinets’ specifications are as follows: 1. The Nitrogen Storage Cabinet shall be 30 inches wide, 16 inches deep and 30 inches high. 2. The Nitrogen Storage Cabinet shall have a 1” NPT ID drain in one corner of the floor to allow drainage of the cabinet when it is tilted.  All fittings shall be 316 stainless steel. 3. The Nitrogen Storage Cabinet shall be equipped with purge inlet and outlet ports, 1/4 NPT, on opposite sides, one high and one low.  All fittings shall be 316 stainless steel. 4. The Nitrogen Storage Cabinet shall have one removable, full length and full width, shelf located at the center of the cabinet height. 5. The interior of the nitrogen storage cabinet shall contain no blind holes or 90 degree bends to preclude cleaning of interior via flushing to cleanliness level 300. 6. The Nitrogen Storage Cabinet shall be equipped with two doors, which shall be 24 inches high and 11 inches wide with smooth interior construction (no interior bracing).   7. The Nitrogen Storage Cabinet doors shall be hinged to the outside.  The latches shall be extremely smooth functioning, not imparting jolts to cabinet upon opening/closing latches and shed no particles from moving parts. 8. Door seals shall be gas-tight (leak rate less than 10-4 cc/sec) and shall be able to maintain seal against an exterior water pressure of one foot of water. 9. All O-rings and gaskets shall be manufactured of low out-gassing materials.	Gasket material shall be approved by customer.  Low off-gassing Viton is acceptable.  All gaskets shall be made from the same material, unless specifically approved otherwise.  After 1 week purge with high purity nitrogen, interior of cabinet shall measure &lt; 10 ng/cm2 on exposed silicon wafer per SEMI MF 1982-1103 Method B (formerly ASTM 1982-99 Method B). 10. All metal parts of the Nitrogen Storage Cabinet shall be constructed of 316L stainless steel.  The cabinet support stand may be either 316L or 316. 11. The Cabinet Support Stand shall support the Nitrogen Storage Cabinet base at a height of 40 inches above the floor.  Stand shall not exceed footprint of cabinet (30x16 inches). 12. The Cabinet Support Stand shall have leveling feet. 13. All interior surfaces of the Nitrogen Storage Cabinet shall be mechanically polished to a well-defined finish and then electro polished. 14. All exterior surfaces of the Nitrogen Storage Cabinet and the Cabinet Support shall be mechanically polished to a well-defined finish. 15. All welds shall be ground smooth and blended and shall be subjected to inspection. 16. All interior corners shall be coved to a minimum radius of 5/8 inch. 17. Certification sheets for all materials of construction shall be furnished.	Leak test and weld inspection reports shall be furnished. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 2, 2005. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

The requirement is to provide construction and testing services for the project titled, "Construction and Testing of Surface Corona Discharge-Catalytic Reactor for Oxidative Treatment of Waste Gas Emissions from the Pulp and Paper Industry".  The EPA is interested in constructing and  testing the application of a novel surface corona discharge ozone generator with a catalytic reactor for partial and deep oxidation of air pollutants form the emission streams of Kraft pulp and paper mills. The purpose of this requirement is to conduct pilot-scale field test on the treatment of  both "synthetic" waste gas streams and actual waste gas streams from the pulping area of the Kraft mill.  The nature of the acquisition requires a contractor that possesses the test systems that could allow for the generation and/or acquisition of typical Kraft pulp waste gases, characterization of  those gas streams, and analysis of the desired treatment product.  This is essential to test and assure that the advanced oxidation reactor to be developed is effective for the pulp and paper industry. The U.S. EPA-National Risk Management Research Lab in Cincinnati, OH is only aware of one source  that is available for this project.  This project requires a research and test facility that has the capabilities for pulp and material testing, has paper testing laboratories, a highly instrumented laboratory papermaking machine and other pilot scale pulp and paper production equipment, a pilot  coater and lamination machine, a process control laboratory, a coating laboratory, and a chemical engineering laboratory. Miami University's Paper Science and Engineering Department is the only research group that is known to have the necessary equipment specificied, staff trained, experience,  knowledge of the process and analytical capability to conduct full pulping and pollution related studies.  The unique experience and capabilities that Miami University's Paper Science and Engineering Department possess are essential to the completion of this project.  Interested parties, who feel  that they possess the capabilities to perform the services described above, should provide a capabilities statement demonstrating their qualifications.  A statement of work and any other applicable documents will be made available upon request.  The information received in response to this notice  will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Please send your documentation to Angela Schopler at the office identified above, by fax (513)487-2107 or by e-mail at schopler.angela@epa.gov which establishes that their specifications  or qualifications meet the EPA's requirement.  Documentation must be received within fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by the EPA.  Telephone request will not be honored.  A determination by the EPA not to compete this proposed contract based upon  responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>In accordance with Simplified Acquisition Procedures the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology an Genetics (DCEG), Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB), intends to procure on a sole-source basis with the University of California at Berkeley, 216 Early Warren Hall, Berkeley, California  94720 for proteomic analyses on serum, urine and cell lysates among benzene exposed subjects.  One of DCEG projects is a cross-sectional study of approximately 250 workers exposed from 0.5 to > 10 ppm benzene and 150 unexposed controls in
Tianjin, China.  In this study proteomic techniques where used to identify novel markers of exposure and effect. The identified markers have recently been characterized and are thought to be chemotactic cytokines, which play an important role in host-defense and cell-maturation and development.  It was in the laboratory of Dr. Smith who is the worlds leading expert on benzene toxicogenomics at the University of California at Berkeley, that was able to identify proteomic changes in serum of high exposed subjects using SELDI-TOF MS analyses. At the University of California Berkley the SELDI-TOF analyses was performed on the samples from our study of workers exposed to benzene, they carried out the interpretation of the data spectra, performed data analyses and provided crucial support in the interpretation of the results in the context of benzene toxicogenomics. In a follow-up study DCEG needs the University of California Berkeley to:  1) Analyze all serum fractions (previous work was only done on fraction 1,3 and 6) for proteomic changes using SELDI-TOF MS and three chip surfaces (WCX, IMAC, H50) (20 high exposed subjects and 20 matched controls);  2) Analyze serum fractions from low exposed subjects (n=20) and matched controls (n=20) for proteomic changes as identified under item a;  3) analyze urine from high benzene exposed subjects
(n=20) and matched controls (n=20) for proteomic changes using SELDI-TOF MS and three chip surfaces (WCX, IMAC, H50); and 4) Analyze cell lysates from high benzene exposed subjects (n=20) and matched controls (n=20) for proteomic changes using SELDI-TOF MS and three chip surfaces (WCX, IMAC, H50).  The University of California Berkeley is the only vendor known to the NCI Researcher that can process the samples without the introduction of new variables in on-going research.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above service, without introducing new variables into an ongoing research experiments it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on September 6, 2005.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov.  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to verify questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).

The Government requires world class providers of security services that can demonstrate the following: a proven track record of verifiable experience in performing similar and relevant projects or contracts of like magnitude; rigorous management practices and controls, including a robust quality control plan and program that ensures the highest quality service; an effective, documented safety program and a record of superior past performance on contracts of similar complexity and magnitude to assure the Government of the firm’s ability to deliver the most professional and reliable service possible. 

The offeror(s) shall provide all management, supervision, labor, and material/equipment (except that specified as Government Furnished) necessary to provide security services in support of PFPA’s mission. The basic mission is to provide security for assigned facilities and to ensure a safe environment for all personnel including DoD/WHS employees, official guests and visitors within the assigned buildings and facilities. Some of the tasks associated with these contracts include: preventing unauthorized access to facilities; maintaining order in assigned buildings; deterring, recording and reporting criminal activity in and around all assigned DoD/WHS controlled facilities; access control (ID check); foot/area patrols; building and grounds security; and safeguarding classified Government information and materials located at DoD/WHS owned, leased, or controlled facilities throughout the Pentagon Reservation and the NCR.  This requirement includes the services of both armed and unarmed security officers; all officers will be required to obtain Security Clearances. Potential offerors are notified that physical examinations and drug testing of all security officers are required in accordance with PFPA rules and regulations. 

This requirement is being solicited in accordance with FAR Part 12 – Acquisition of Commercial Items and Source Selection procedures found in FAR Part 15 will be used to determine the Best Value solution to providing these services. Anticipated Evaluation Factors are: Management and Technical Approach, to include the offeror’s Quality Control plan and program; Past Performance; and Price.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT FOR PHOTOMASK INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM FOR FUTURE GENERATION MASK MANUFACTURING.  This is a pre-solicitation synopsis which is not a request for competitive proposals.  The work will identify, analyze and evaluate enabling technologies for future generations of mask manufacturing.  The Air Force Research Laboratory, Manufacturing Technology Division (AFRL/MLM) intends to award a contract (with 50/50 cost share) or a Technology Investment Agreement (with 50/50 cost share) as appropriate, on the basis of less than full and open competition for this requirement to Photronics, Inc., 15 Secor Road, Brookfield, CT 06804.  Under the authority of Title III of the Defense Production Act (DPA) (50 U.S.C. App. Section 2061 et seq.), the Title III Program Office is contemplating this procurement to maintain a U.S. owned, domestic, merchant photomask manufacturer in order to meet the future defense requirements for critical integrated circuits (classified applications).  Note:  If subsequent phases are awarded, the offeror must be able to perform classified work in their cleared facility.  The period of performance for the procurement is anticipated to be 12 months.  A description of the task is as follows:  Mask Materials, Pattern Manufacturing, and Repair Technical Analysis and Study for feature size 45nm node and below.  The ability of the offeror to conduct this technical analysis and study and accomplish the goals of this program will be assessed based on the offeror’s demonstrated leadership in the industry and the offeror’s capability to effectively address manufacturing challenges facing future generations of photomasks.  These challenges include (a) identification, analysis and evaluation of the enabling technologies and (b) reduction of cycle-time and costs for manufacturing leading-edge masks.  The government intends to issue an award for these requirements on a Sole Source basis per FAR 6.302-1(a)(1), “Only One Responsible Source” or  “DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations 37.400 (b),” based on their domestic R&D activity and on their experience as a merchant industrial supplier providing leading edge technology, as well as an assessment of the program risk to the Government.  Offerors who are capable of providing the services stated above shall fully identify their interest and submit, in writing, information documenting their qualifications and capabilities to meet the requirements stated above within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  This documentation shall specify the offeror’s area of expertise and experience.  It shall include the photomask feature size currently supported as an industrial supplier.  The documentation shall include a listing of products and services currently offered as a merchant industrial supplier along with market share in each area.  The documentation shall identify relevant past, present and future research along with information on research budgets, personnel, and facilities.  The information should identify the feature size currently under R&D and the time table for migrating to successive smaller feature sizes.  The offeror shall document their experience in transitioning product from R&D to production.  Responses received after 15 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis, and will not be considered.  Direct all technical questions pertaining to this acquisition to Capt Mitchell Fait, Project Engineer, at Mitchell.Fait@wpafb.af.mil.  Note:  In addition, direct all questions pertaining to this acquisition to the contracting point of contacts listed above in this announcement.  Only one responsible source per capability of interest and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements as per the authority under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Vicksburg Consolidated Contracting Office intends to solicit on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.501)a)(1) to Hi-Techniques, Inc., 2515 Frazier Avenue, Madison, WI  53713; 608-221-7500.  This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP)  only one responsible source and not other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Geotechnical and Structur es Laboratory (GSL) require data acquisition for mobilizing large amounts of complimentary hardware, which prevents their rapid deployment.  A portable system which does not require such complimentary hardware will significantly reduce the cost of fielding  experiments and will reduce the response time required for fielding.  Additionally, the nonworking WINDAS 600 system is allowed as a trade-in value by the manufacturer (a value not possible with any other vendor), which further enhances the opportunity to  acquire the new 32 channel system.  Delivery is not later than 16 September 2005.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, interested parties may submit their capabilities and qualif ications to provide this supply or service in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 1600 hrs CST on 01 September 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct t his procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  No RFQ will be issued based upon this Notice of Intent.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to address potential offeror’s questions.


Question 1: To ensure that the abatement system is sized appropriately to handle the process gases listed in Table 2, should the offeror assume that the typical process
gas flows for this application equal the Min Flow Rate (SCCM) stated in Table 2?

Answer to Question 1: Yes. The abatement system must be configured to handle the minimum gas flows listed in Table 2.


Question 2: In Section 7 it states, "The system is to be of passive dry chemical absorbance or gas reactor column design."  Is NRL open to other effective abatement technologies for this application that will have a significantly lower Cost of Ownership compared to dry chemical absorbance abatement technology?

Answer to Question 2: Yes.


Question 3: Does the NRL facility have acid drain capabilities?
  
Answer to Question 2: Yes.


Question 4: How many chambers does the Oxford tool have?

Answer to Question 4:  There is one chamber in the Oxford PECVD system.


Question 5: What is the substrate being used in the PECVD process?  Is is Silicon?  Is it Gallium Nitride?

Answer to Question 5: A variety of substrates will be used in the multi-user PECVD system, including silicon, gallium nitride, gallium arsenide, diamond, and glass.


Question 6: The minimum gas flows are indicated in the specification, but what are the process gas flows?  Are they different from the minimum?

Answer to Question 6: The gas flows are dependent on the process being implemented and the abatement equipment should be sized to handle the minimum flows listed in Table 2.


Question 7: The gases are typically put into the tool using Mass Flow Controllers. What are the maximum flow rates of these controllers for the different gases being used in the process?

Answer to Question 7: Vendors supplying gas abatement equipment are required only to meet the minimum flow requirements listed in Table 2. The values listed are actually the maximum mass flow controller ratings for the corresponding gas.

<DESC>MODIFICATION NO. 3
The purpose of this modification is to incorporate following information:

1.	At Section L.10, the language here was deleted in its’ entirety, because it was inadvertently included in the RFP;
2.	The discussion at Section L.10.(4)(v)(A) refers to the past success the offeror has had with regard to integrating the employment of small businesses into their normal business operations, or documented initiatives for achieving the previously noted objective.  At Section M.4.1.4.5, “Effectiveness of Key Personnel”, resides the criterion that will include a rating of the extent to which the offeror’s Key Personnel  have employed strategies to achieve successes in the area of small business employment, as well as, other characteristics that identify the staff as being uniquely effective in the conduct of their work performance;
3.	This is to confirm that although current USAID personnel may be included in proposals as proposed personnel, they are subject to criminal and regulatory restrictions that may restrict or prohibit their employment, and which prohibit them from participating in the development of a proposal or providing non-public information for use in a proposal.  These rules including 18 U.S.C. Sections 207-208, and 5 C.F.R. part 2635.

“Q19:   Paragraph L.9.c, Page No. 67 states that overhead expenses for loan capital funds are not allowable. Please clarify this statement; specifically, does it apply to initial startup expenses of microfinancing organizations? Additionally, are MHO expenses allowable?
A:      The language regarding loan capital funds should be deleted in its’ entirety;” 
Q24:  Section J, Attachment 4 for the RFP provides a Resume Format, but there is no guidance in the RFP about using this resume format.  Also, the format asks for information such as “Annual Salary and Proposed Labor Category”, neither of which are appropriate for a technical submission for a CPFF completion type contract.  Please clarify if and how this Resume Format should be used?
A.  The Resume Format found in the RFP is a “Suggested Resume Format, which is usually adequate for most purposes”.  Of course, we feel it is unnecessary to dictate to our audience any level of strict conformance with a specified format for such a requirement in view of the fact that there are a myriad of such formats available. 
Q25:  Please clarify the precise estimated completion dates for each of the programs that will eventually be assumed into the MIDAS contract.  Also if possible, it would be helpful to receive LOP, or most recent annual work plans for those programs?
A.  Of course, we realize, appreciate, and understand that offering any “precise estimated completion dates” for any of the proposed activities is currently beyond our abilities of our very competent technical staff.  The Mission will make a decision on the future of current programs at the earliest possible juncture after the MIDAS contract award, in collaboration with the successful offeror.  Just a note:  In many cases our on-going programs have no potential for synergy with, and therefore no possibility for merging into any of the proposed MIDAS activities.   We encourage offerors to simply focus on submitting innovative responses to the RFP. Otherwise, please see Q11 and the related answer at Modification No. 3 to the RFP:
Q11: Will offerors have access to documents that were generated by the implementers who are currently under contract to USAID?
A:   The RFP and Annexes were designed to minimize the extent to which any offeror would need additional background documentation.  We suggest that any offeror who may need additional information pursue it via a “Freedom of Information Act” Request.  

Q26:  Section C3 of the RFDP states, “Neither program ($10 Million Specialty Coffee Program, and the $10 Million Dairy Industry Program) will be included in the overall effort”.  Please provide additional clarifications to this statement?
A.  We feel that the statement is quite clear.  Neither of the stated programs will be a part of the proposed MIDAS effort.
Q27:  Section H.17 “Grants under Contracts”, and Section L.9(d) “Summary of Budget Elements” suggest that the contractor will be responsible for a sizeable grants program.  Can USAID offer guidance as to the amount of grant funding anticipated, or the magnitude of the grants funding relative to technical assistance?  Or, does the contractor have complete latitude to propose amounts and mix of TA/grants consistent with proposed approaches?
A.  Please refer to our answer to the previous Q4 noted in the answers at Modification No. 3.
Q4:    With regard to the allocation of funds on this procurement, what percentage of the $160 million will be allocated for grants and what percentage will be identified for technical assistance? 
A:     The Mission has not made a determination with regard to any amount(s) that may be allocated to Grants.  Each of the four major components under the RFP requires a different mix of technical and other assistance, and the Mission encourages all bidders to submit creative and realistic proposals.
Q28:  Given the exceptionally long (90) day proposal development period, we suggest that USAID consider a second round of questions and answers, at perhaps the midpoint of the process.  We believe that after conducting field research for the MIDAS proposal, contractors will have several additional informed questions and issues for USAID. Responses and/or guidance from USAID to these will result in more responsive, stronger proposals for MIDAS implementation?
A.  A special thank you for this question.  Please be advised that we surely do appreciate the degree of effort that will be involved in the preparation of responses to the MIDAS RFP.  Further, we are confident, and fully believe that our current approach will result in very strong and competitive responses to the RFP.
Q29:  Section L.10(4)(v)(A) states, “..Successful use of small business concerns will be considered as part of the evaluation of past performance in Section M”, however, Section M.5.1.4, Past Performance, does not assign a factor to the use of small businesses.  Please clarify if a specific evaluation factor will be applied to the use of small businesses, and if this information can be presented in an Annex?
A.  The evaluation of Past Performance will include an assessment of the degree to which such businesses have been utilized in the past by the offeror.  The specific evaluation factor to be addressed in Section M at Past Performance is at M.4.1.4.1, Quality of Performance, where the extent to which small businesses added to the achievement of this factor.  
Q30:  Section L.10 cannot be removed in entirety because there is relevant information to proposal development contained therein.  What sections are to be removed?
A.  The part of Section L.10 that should be disregarded is at Subsection (a), the fourth paragraph that Begins, “Describe how the team will coordinate and integrate the municipal government strengthening and alternative development investments.  In addition, …………..growth at the national level. 
Q31:  Section M.4.1.4.5 is identified as “Effectiveness of Key Personnel, however the version released to the Public notes that Section M.5.1.4.5 addresses “Effectiveness of Key Personnel”?
A.  Section M.5.1.4.5, Effectiveness of Key Personnel is the correct one.

<DESC>Description
"CMS intends to award one (1) cost-type contract set-aside for small business to assist CMS in performing data processing and medical reviews for the Medicaid Error Rate (MER) project.  Potential offerors are hereby advised their accounting system must be determined adequate for segregation of costs under a cost reimbursement contract in accordance with FAR 30 & 31 in order to be eligible for award of a contract.  Please also be advised that in accordance with FAR 52.219-14 Limitations of Subcontracting, "By submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the Offeror/Contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for - (1) services (except construction). At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the [small business] concern."" 
BACKGROUND: CMS must estimate improper payments in the Medicaid program as directed by the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA).  The IPIA directs each executive agency, in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, to review all of its programs and activities annually, identify those that may be susceptible to significant improper payments, estimate the annual amount of improper payments, and submit those estimates to Congress.  
The IPIA defines improper payments as: (a) any payment that should not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount, including both overpayments and underpayments, under statutory, contractual, administrative, or other legally applicable requirements; and (b) payments made to an ineligible beneficiary, any duplicate payments, payments for services not received, and any payment that does not account for credit for applicable discounts.
To implement error rate measurement in Medicaid, CMS will use a national contracting strategy.  Under this strategy, CMS will engage three contractors: (1) a statistical contractor (posted to Fedbizopps.gov August 4, 2005); (2) a documentation/database contractor (posted to Fedbizopps.gov August 10, 2005); and (3) a review contractor.  The statistical contractor will perform all statistical, sampling and error rate calculation functions.  The documentation/database contractor will gather medical policies and other necessary information from states; will maintain a database of the medical policies (along with quarterly updates to these policies) and will gather medical records from providers.  All information collected by the documentation/database contractor will be maintained in electronic format.  The review contractor will use the policies and medical records obtained by the documentation/database contractor to perform the medical reviews, provide findings to the statistical contractor, jointly write the final report with the statistical contractor and submit the report to CMS.
DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS: The successful offeror, as the review contractor, shall make a payment determination for each sampling unit by performing data processing reviews and medical reviews.  The review contractor shall review each sampling unit to determine if was processed through the claims payment system correctly, medically necessary, coded correctly and properly paid or denied.  The review contractor shall validate whether each sampling unit was paid correctly based on: information found on the sampling unit, the information in the medical record, the information in the claims processing system, and state policies.  The review contractor shall conduct the data processing reviews on-site for each state selected, visiting each state between two and five times.  The medical reviews may be performed at a central location.
The sampling unit is defined as an individually priced service (e.g., a physician office visit, a hospital stay, a month of enrollment in Medicare).  The sampling unit may be a claim or line item. It is estimated that between 800 – 1200 sampling units or an average of 1000, per state, will need to be reviewed to achieve 3% precision at the 95% confidence level. The contractor shall perform this work for one complete production, December 31, 2005, through November 30, 2007.  This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP).  CMS anticipates release of the Request for Proposal September 2005 and it will be made available electronically at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the services and supplies described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above within 15 calendar days from the date of this synopsis.  The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC), has a requirement for additional customized computer systems to upgrade the current NEIC processing system.  There are currently 40 unique systems in use at the NEIC, customized to meet specific USGS requirements.  Additional systems must be fully compatible with the current systems.  Because these systems will be used for monitoring in a mission critical system, maintenance is also required as follows: 1) Local, on-site support available seven days per week; 2) Repair of critical components within 24 hours of notifications of problem; 3) Trouble shooting, as required, either remotely or on-site; 4) Replacing faulty or dubious hardware components, when necessary.  A local Microsoft-Certified technician is required who is familiar with the architecture, components, and functionality of the 40 custom systems currently in use at the NEIC.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the services and supplies specified as a sole source from Bill Bennett, Centennial, Colorado, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services and supplies are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Region, Boulder City, Nevada, intends to award on a sole source basis a purchase order to the University of Arizona.  Pursuant to the Supreme Court Decrees of 1964 (Decree) in Arizona v. California, Reclamation acting as the water master for the Colorado River, on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior, is required to account for consumptive use of water from the mainstem of the Colorado River by diverter, point of diversion, and State.  To fulfill this mandate, Reclamation has implemented and continues to improve upon the Lower Colorado River Accounting System (LCRAS).  LCRAS is a method of accounting for water use along the Colorado River that directly calculates the ETos of each agricultural water user, and then performs a water balance in each of four reaches of the Colorado River using measurement or estimations of all inflows and outflows to the reach.  A portion of the residual or resultant of the water balance is reapportioned to each diverter's ETos providing their calculated consumptive use.   The method calculates the ETos of agricultural and riparian vegetation using remote sensing and GIS technology and reference ETos data from automated weather stations (AWS) operated by the California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) and the Arizona Meteorological Network (AZMET).  A standardized reference ETos is an important input parameter for LCRAS.  The University of Arizona owns and operates the ASMET from which the ETos data Reclamation requires is collected and reported.  No other vendor has access or permission to access these weather reporting stations, nor does the University of Arizona subcontract this effort. The University of Arizona, through its Arizona Meteorological Network (AZMET), and the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) have been cooperating on projects that support the development and implementation of BOR's Lower Colorado River Accounting System (LCRAS) for the past seven years.  At this time, it would be impractical and cost prohibitive for Reclamation to contract on the open market for both the installation and operation of a new system of automated weather stations when an existing system is available and fully functional.  Consequently, the University of Arizona is the only viable source for this contracted effort.  This procurement will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The anticipated award date is September 9, 2005.  Questions may be directed to Leslie Leavitt at lleavitt@lc.usbr.gov

The Agency for International Development (USAID), USAID/Colombia, under its’ Agriculture and Alternative Development Office (AADO) intends to focus upon galvanizing strategic private sector 
response capacity to the economic growth opportunities and challenges associated with a healthier macroeconomic setting and an integrated trade/investment environment.  AADO’s “Additional Investment 
for Sustainable Alternative Development” Program (Más Inversión para el Desarrollo Alternativo Sostenible (MIDAS)) is the vehicle designed to address these issues.   The Colombian private sector reflects a broad continuum of entities which range from large, sophisticated corporations owned by Colombian or multinational investors, as well as, entrepreneurs engaged in micro enterprise business ventures.  Each class 
of business entity has the potential to expand its operations and to create new job opportunities that will encourage the unemployed to avoid the entrapment of illicit activities. USAID’s goal will be to provide 
small and medium sized enterprises (SME) with strategic institution-building support programs designed to sustainably address the primary informational and market development barriers which limit SME growth potential in Colombia.

<DESC>U.S. Special Operations Command, Technical Applications Contracting Office (TAKO), ATTN: AMSAT-D-TK, Lee Boulevard, Building 401, Fort Eustis, VA, 23604-5577 issues this Request for Information (RFI) regarding the top-level functional and operational capabilities, performance, and design for an avionics grade data receptacle product that provides an intelligent microprocessor-based unit that permits data transfer by providing sockets for some form of portable, securable storage media (i.e. PCMIA Cards, USB Memory sticks, Flash Disk Media, etc.) and can communicate via dual independent 10/100BaseT Ethernet ports.

1.	Background

During development of the Common Avionics Architect System (CAAS) for 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne) (SOAR (A)) helicopter fleet it has been discovered that the current data loader device does not have the required throughput to support the loading of mission specific data in a timely manner.  An example is the Embedded Digital Map (EDMG), which allows the addition of outside reference data, referred to as GEO Chips,  (such as digital pictures, JPEG files, etc.) to be associated with a specific target.  These files cannot be stored in persistent memory as they may be classified.  The current data loader cannot transfer these files in a timely manner.  The current data loader utilizes PCMCIA memory cards to store mission data.  This data is transferred via the MIL-STD-1553B data bus to the mission processor.  The maximum transfer speed is 1 MB/sec.  Each GEO chip is anticipated to be in excess of 2 MB.  The current data loader is limited to maximum of 1 megabit/sec transfer rate (a 16 megabyte file will take a minimum of 128 seconds to transfer).  TAKO is looking for new and innovative technical approaches to provide a faster data transfer rate, increased memory storage capacity, storage of classified data that can be rapidly zeroized and can execute background processing to track a minimum 10 to a maximum of 200 closest airports and navigation aids based on current aircraft position from DAFIF data (read only to meet uncorruptable database requirements for Global Air Traffic Management (GATM)) loaded via storage media in the data loader.
  
2.	Operations Concept 

The envisioned new data loader should be able to utilize the latest avionics grade secure storage media technology to store the mission data and be able to transfer that data to the CAAS Ethernet Avionics System LAN that transfers the data to the on board mission processors.  There are significant technical issues involved, including but not limited to:  maximum transfer rates, single vs. multiple line rates (server), in device RAM Cache, single client (sustain) vs. multiple client (peak) read/write potential, maximum transfer rates, in device intelligent microprocessor for processing DAFIF searches and secure storage capabilities for storage media (i.e. PCMIA, USB Memory Sticks, etc).  Also, for consideration is the requirement for the lightest and smallest unit possible to limit and/or improve the cube and weight requirements for use on the aircraft.

3.	System Requirements 

3.1.	Four to Six Storage Media Sockets

3.1.1.	Slot 1 - DAFIF data (read only to meet uncorruptable database
            requirement for GATM)
	Slot 2 -	 Mission Planning Data (Read/Write)(ACP Lists, Flight Plans,
    Communication Frequency and COMSEC Presets, etc)
Slot 3 - GEO Chip data (Read/Write) (imagery that is linked to a specific
geo reference point and can be displayed on the map, i.e. picture of target)
	Slot 4 - Electronic Order of Battle (Read/Write) (can be updated based
upon on-board aircraft sensors)
	Slot 5 – Growth
	Slot 6 – Growth 

4.	Ethernet interface

1.1.	Supports Ethernet protocols:

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)
File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
Network File Server (NFS)
Common Internet File System (CIFS) / Samba /SMB)

2.	Background processing to track 200 closest airports and navigation aids based on current aircraft position that meet DO-178 Level C requirements supporting these functions:

Database Closest Data Searches
Database Identifier Searches
Worldwide Database Access

3.	Weight Requirements:  Objective 3 lbs to Threshold 5 lbs.

4.	Size Requirements:  No larger than:  Length 6.5” x Width 5.75” x Height 2.25”

5.	Mounting Requirements:  Can be mounted via Dzus rail.

6.	Zeroization:  Fast erase and secure erase capabilities for zeroization via software or discrete commands

7.	Growth Capability:  Gigabit Ethernet, additional mass storage.
 



8.	Environmental and EMI Qualifications:  Must be able to qualify to MIL-STD-461 and MIL-STD-810F for the majority of the EMI/Environmental considerations.  The vibration qualification is based on a combination of several standards to meet the requirements for different aircraft.   

9.	Possible Program 

Dependent on the responses of this RFI, a follow on program may include the following phases: (a) one or more engineering tests and analysis to determine performance characteristics and limitations, (b) a proof-of-concept demonstration in a CAAS software development bench (c) a leave-behind operational prototype.  However, the government has not decided upon such a program and this RFI does not constitute notice of intent to embark on such a development program. 

In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI, including any subsequent requests for proposal (RFP). Only responders who have already developed or have avionics grade data loading devices and demonstrated results are desired.

<DESC>The Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection (IAIP) Acquisition Division is seeking potential sources from the General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) 70, SIN 132-51, Information Technology Services to support the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in the areas of vulnerability identification, protective measures and technical application.  The IAIP Directorate of DHS merges the capability to identify and assess a broad range of intelligence information concerning threats to the homeland, issue timely warnings and take appropriate preventive and protective action.  Within IAIP, the Protective Security Division (PSD) supports the National Strategy for Homeland Security by identifying vulnerabilities, conducting risk mitigation and analyses and developing protective measures.  The proposed acquisition, which is contemplated to be for a one-year base period and three (3) one-year option periods will be to develop a Risk/Readiness Digital Dashboard (R2D).  The R2D will facilitate an understanding of the Risk/Readiness profile of Critical Infrastructure/Key Resources (CI/KR) possessing capability to rapidly communicate this information across federal, state and local government agencies. Risk aspect of the R2D should replace “report cards” generated by existing activities. Readiness aspect of R2D will be a visualization of all information needed for compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directives 7 and 8 (HSPD-7 & HSPD-8) for CI/KR in both the public and private sector. While tightly interlinked (readiness must be informed by risk), these two dashboard components are not interchangeable.  It is anticipated that a scaled-down prototype will be operational by the end of FY06.  Based on the results of this proof-of-value prototype version, DHS may then elect to fund the full system within an estimated implementation period of 2-3 fiscal years.  Overall system objective will be to allow DHS to identify, in greater depth, the current Readiness of the CI/KR to respond to various threats.  The DHS R2D enterprise system will comprise a data repository; analytics for assessing Risk and Readiness; and applications to drive enterprise query, reporting and decision support. The prototype effort will focus on development of the Risk/Readiness analytic metrics; integration of system components; and compilation of required data.  Initial proof-of-value (POV) prototype development is contemplated for completion within six months from date of contract award with subsequent phases yielding a fully operational production system within 2-3 years.  Initial phase of POV prototype development will consist of three main components: advance the current PSD risk calculation methodology; identify targeted capabilities and substantiate other calculation methodologies through an appropriate “think tank” or similar service; and build the prototype as POV using appropriate risk calculation methodologies and data available.  Funding and migration to a full production version will be contingent upon evaluation and approval of the initial prototype.  Any resultant contractor will be required to comply with Federal Enterprise Architecture requirements and provide reports compliant with Earned Value Management.  This sources sought synopsis represents a market survey and is not a Request For Proposals or Invitation For Bids.  Interested sources are invited to submit a one-page statement of capability (Microsoft Word) to include company name, address, and point of contact, telephone number, e-mail address, facsimile number, and business size (indicating whether you are a large or small business for purposes of the assigned NAICS code).  Written responses must be received no later than 12 Sep 05, 4:30 PM (ET).  Responses should be emailed (preferable) or faxed to the point of contact designated below.

<DESC>The Air Force Air Mobility Battlelab plans to demonstrate the military utility of using Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) compatible and covert lighting on aerial refueling tanker aircraft.  Battlelab intent is to demonstrate a covert capability that enables in-flight operations in an NVIS environment.  Aircraft lighting should be capable of being visible only with the use of night vision devices.  To explore this concept, the Battlelab seeks innovative, low cost, commercial or government off the shelf lighting technology that can be temporarily installed on a KC 135 Stratotanker to make its exterior and boom pod interior lighting NVIS friendly/compatible and undetectable to the unaided eye.  The demonstration system must be capable of operating during all in-flight profiles and be compliant with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations.  The exterior lighting must be NVIS friendly and covert so that it does not detract from safety or impede operations by degrading the vision of any aircrew members wearing NVGs during night air-to-air refueling, close wing formation, in-flight rendezvous, or other phases of in-flight operations.  The lighting should be friendly/compatible with all AN/AVS-9 and AN/AVS-10 NVGs.  The following exterior KC-135 lights require NVIS friendly capability for the demonstration: Wing Tip Navigation (NSN 6240-01-262-0148); Tail Cone Navigation (NSN 6240-00-044-6914); Upper and Lower Strobe (NSN 6620-01-358-9974); Underwing, Underbody, Multi Point Refueling System (MPRS) Outboard Nacelle & MPRS Horizontal Illumination (NSN 6240-00-132-5317); Pilot Director Indicator Letters (NSN 6240-00-155-7947); Pilot Director Indicator  Background (NSN 6240-00-155-7848); Pilot Director Indicator Arrow Strips (NSN 6240-00-132-5328); Aerial Refueling Flood (NSN 6240-01-512-7021); Wing Scanning (NSN 6240-00-132-5328); Boom Nozzle (NSN 6240-00-155-7824); Boom Nozzle w/Time Compliance Technical Order 1422 (NSN 6240-00-451-1409); Boom Marker (NSN 624000-683-0723).  The following boom operator interior lights must be NVIS compatible in accordance with MIL-STD-3009: Eye Brow Instrumentation (NSN 6240-14-200-2756); and MPRS Exterior Light Control Panel (NSN 6220-01-450-9535).  Through this request for information (RFI), the Air Force is requesting information concerning mature technologies, which meet the requirements previously stated, to be used in a Battlelab concept demonstration.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY (SOURCES SOUGHT) AND NOT A SOLICITATION. THE RFI IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING CAPABILITY STATEMENTS FROM 8(a) VENDORS OUTLINING HOW THEY CAN SATISFY THE GOVERNMENTS NEEDS FOR AN 8(a) COMPETITIVE ACQUISITION.  THE CAPABILITY STATEMENTS SHOULD BE LIMITED TO 3 PAGES AND PROVIDE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE VENDOR'S ORGANIZATION (BIO); TEAMING AGREEMENTS; RESOURCE AND TECHNOLOGY AVAILABILITY AND RISK; AND SUGGESTIONS.  CAPABILITY STATEMENTS FROM POTENTIAL 8(a) MENTOR-PROTÉGÉ JOINT VENTURES AND TEAMING PARTNERSHIPS ARE ENCOURAGED.  The Office of Acquisition (AQM) in the Department of State seeks to issue an 8(a) competitive procurement on behalf of the Bureau of Resource Management, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Global Financial Services (RM/GFS) to assist the Department in its effort to provide financial services in support of overseas and domestic operations at the Global Financial Services (GFS) in Charleston, SC.  These services include Disbursing, Accounting, Payroll, Payments, and operations in support of these activities, including services related to the operation and maintenance of local area networks, maintenance of installed systems supporting automated financial systems and systems analysis, user support and training related to installed automated financial systems, and other related services.  These activities currently employ approximately 300 full time personnel.  Labor categories will include program management, financial, information technology, and administrative services.  The Department desires to award a single contract for this support to GFS Charleston.  The contract will primarily focus on the GFS Charleston, but support services will be needed by other RM Bureau organizations.  Therefore, the Washington DC metropolitan area will be a secondary place of performance, with a projected 5% of the total contract requirement designated for Washington area RM Bureau usage.  Therefore the vendor must have or establish a facility in the Charleston Metro area.  There will be a need for contractor personnel to travel between Charleston, SC and the Washington DC metro area (DC, MD, VA), as well as some overseas travel.  The Department seeks from 8(a) vendors capability statements outlining how they are able to meet the Department's need for this support services requirement.   This Request for Information (Sources Sought) offers the opportunity for 8(a) vendors to present a capability statement and teaming agreement to shows their qualification on meeting RM's needs for support services.  Currently the Department intends to offer this opportunity to all 8(a) vendors capable of meeting or exceeding the requirements established in this document.  Vendors should indicate their General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contract number, if applicable. Indicate size (e.g. number of client sites, related contract(s) or project(s), dollar value of each contract or project, scope), and teaming agreements. (3 pages) Capability statements from potential 8(a) Mentor-Protégé joint ventures and teaming partnerships are encouraged.  Review of vendor responses and information exchange meeting(s): The Government will review submissions to ascertain the relevance to the RM environment and goals.  Subsequent to review of vendor responses to the RFI, the Department may at its discretion hold technical information exchange meeting(s) with respondents. The meeting(s) will focus on industry experiences related to development, technical solutions, best practices and lessons learned, risks and programmatic benefits.  Also, potential bidders may be asked to travel to Charleston for a capability briefing.  Disclaimer: This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not an offer and can not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

<DESC>The Government is interested in acquiring information on non-developmental or commercially available item kits to upgrade the M2 Heavy Barrel Machine Gun. The M2 HB is an automatic, recoil operated, link belt fed, air cooled machine gun. The Enhancement to the M2 machine gun will provide the Warfighter with the ability to quickly change the barrel without the need to reset headspace and timing by implementing a fixed headspace and timing operating system. Improper adjustment of headspace and timing can cause gun malfunctions, parts damage or personnel injury (including death). In addition, current barrel changing procedures negatively impact survivability as the Soldier must be exposed to enemy fire for extended periods of time while changing the barrel and setting headspace and timing. The intent of the Program is to convert existing M2 machine guns currently being overhauled at Anniston Army Depot, AL to a fixed headspace configuration. Primary components of the kit consist a Quick Change Barrel (QCB) System (modified barrel, barrel extension, barrel support), redesigned sight, incorporation of a Picatinny Rail, redesigned flash hider to reduce signature, trigger block manual safety, a handle to rotate barrel into position as well as for carrying a hot barrel, and modifications to the timing mechanism to move headspace and timing requirements on the gun above the operator level. This system also includes a trigger block manual safety, a handle to rotate barrel into position as well as for carrying a hot barrel, and a flash suppressor to reduce signature. This gun must be capable of being mounted on ground mounts as well as most vehicles as an anti-personnel and anti-aircraft weapon. The weapon must provide automatic weapon suppressive fire for offensive and defensive purposes. This weapon must be effective against personnel, light armored vehicles; low, slow flying aircraft; and small boats. The system must utilize military standard .50 caliber ammunition used on the standard M2 HB: M1 Blank / Incendiary / Tracer, Blank M1A1, M2 Ball, M8 Ball Armor Piercing Incendiary, M10 Tracer, M17 Tracer, M20 Ball, Armor Piercing Incendiary-Tracer M23 Incendiary, M33 Ball, M48A1/A2, T249E2 Ball Practice, M903/M962 SLAP and MK 211. System must also be compatible with M858 and M869 ammunition using the M3 recoil amplifier barrel assembly and must be capable of firing blanks using existing accessory devices such as M19 BFA. The Enhanced 50 caliber machine gun shall weigh less than 128 pounds. The system must provide a rail interface surface to allow various fire control devices to be mounted to the weapon interface while not impeding with the normal operation of the attachments or weapon system, including the Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) components. The system must also be rugged enough to withstand military use to include air and shipboard operations without degrading operation and safety performance. The barrels must be capable of interchanging freely without adjusting headspace and timing of the machine gun and have a barrel life of 10,000 rounds minimum. The systemâ€™s sight range scale shall be in meters. The system must meet all environmental compliance requirements, operate in all environmental conditions and have no unique weather, oceanographic or astro-geophysical support requirements. There must be no uncontrolled health or safety hazards to personnel associated with its use, maintenance, and handling. Potential contractors must be able to produce a minimum of 150 systems per month, with a production surge capability to 250 systems per month (1095 total Enhancement Kits + extra barrel (3 barrels per kit) for the first year of production). The weapon must be capable of engaging targets out to 2,000 yards (1,830 meters) (maximum effective range); 7,440 yards (6,800 meters) maximum range. The weaponâ€™s rate of fire shall be no less than 450- 600 rounds per minute. Interested parties are requested to provide information regarding relevant capabilities and manufacturing experience to Ronald Ryder. Submit information on or before 27 September 2005 by email to: ryder@pica.army.mil or, by mail to Department of the Army, U.S. Army TACOM-Picatinny, Picatinny Center for Contracting and Commerce, ATTN: Ronald L.

In order to provide efficient and eff ective responses to contractor questions, the VCCO requests that all contractor questions be submitted via the aforementioned email address, and not by telephone.  Congress established the JT&E Program in 1972 after a Presidential Commission concluded that  the Department of Defense (DoD) had no capability to conduct tests and evaluations in a joint environment.  The Commission recommended that responsibility for joint testing be vested in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), which now exercises pro gram leadership and publishes guidance in the form of DoD Directive 5010.41, handbooks, policy letters, and memoranda of agreement.  The objectives of the JT&E program are to: "	Assess Service system inter-operability "	Evaluate joint technical and operational concepts and recommend 	improvements "	Validate testing methodologies that have joint Service applications "	Improve modeling and simulation (M&S) validity with field exercise data "	Increase joint mission capability using quantitative data for analysis "	Provide feedback to the acquisition and joint operations communities The OSD sponsors the JT&E Program to conduct tests and evaluations and to provide information required by Congress, OSD, the Unified Commands, Services, and DoD components relative to joint operations.  The JT&E Program is directed by the Deputy Director, Air Warfare, Office of the DOT&E.  The responsibility for management of the program is vested in the JT&E Program Manager (JT&E PM).  The JPO manages the entire JT&E Program, requiring engineering and analysis support in management and oversight functions.   The JPO is responsible for the following: 1) program and task level engineering, 2) test, 3) analysis, 4) management, 5) training, 6) logistical, and 7) administrative support.

Collins, CO) to furnish and install a pre-fabricated, two-unit evaporator vault toilet at Logan Shoals Vista recreation site on the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit.  The pre-fabricated unit is a restroom facility with a human waste vault evaporator system.  The vault evaporator is powered by solar photovoltaic systems installed on the roof of the restroom building.  The unit is a pre-engineered and pre-manufactured, including vault evaporator system, building with all finish interior furnishings, hardware and siding, plumbing, fixtures, and wiring.  The system consists of a vented, evaporative holding vault which decreases the frequency of pumping by more than 50% and eliminates odors.  The Biological Mediation Systems evaporator vault is a patented system which is the only known maker of its kind for vault toilets.  Originally other vault toilet manufacturers were considered.  The other known manufacturers' toilets require traditional pumping, which is less effective at the high-use Logan Shoals Vista recreation site, which receives approximately 50,000 visitors during the summer tourist season.  Vendors believing that they can meet this requirement must submit written information showing clearly that the unit proposed meets or exceeds the specifications and performance of the Biological Mediation Systems' unit.  Also include estimated cost for any proposed unit, including installation.  All information must be received no later than 2:00 pm PT on September 9, 2005.  Mail to 631 Coyote Street, Nevada City, CA 95959, ATTN:  Contracting, or FAX to 530-478-6126.

<SUBJECT>70 -- PDA-184 RADIO INTERFACE CABLE
<DESC>NOTICE TO NEGOTIATE:  The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) located at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida intends to contract directly with SeaLevel Systems, Inc, 155 Technology Place (PO Box 830), Liberty, South Carolina 29657.  USSOCOM has a requirement for the Synchronous Serial Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) 3612 card and radio interface cable developed by SeaLevel Systems, Inc.  The 3612 card and cable are used to connect military laptops, personal digital assistants (PDAs), etc. to the AN/PSC-5D Multi-Band, Multi-Mission Radio (MBMMR).  This information transfer requires a SeaLevel proprietary synchronous driver (permits normal commercial protocols and MILITARY-STANDARD “frameless” transmissions) that interfaces with the 3612 hardware and PDA-184 (a Government developed software application compliant with MIL-STD-188-184).  The 5 foot long cable (AWM E101344 style 20276 VW-1 Space Shuttle-D, SeaLevel part number CA253) uses an industry standard PCMCIA connector that mates to a model 3612 Synchronous Serial Interface card and a MIL connector- MS27467T15B35S which mates to the AN/PSC-5 MBMMR auxiliary multi-pin jack. A strain relief bracket (SeaLevel part number BKSR1) consisting of 2 stainless steel plates, covers and forms a semi-permanent assembly between the cable, the PCMCIA connector, and the end of the PCMCIA card.  The card, cable and driver operate without the loss of bit count integrity at all rates supported by the radio. The radio interface to the card could be any of the following: RS-232, RS-422, RS-485, RS-530, RS-530A, V.35.  The SeaLevel Systems, Inc 3612 Card, cable including MIL Connector and strain relief bracket, P/N: 3612-2099 and associated driver software (proprietary to SeaLevel) are the only known product that meets these requirements and are qualified by the Government to work with MIL-STD-188-184 software.     No other products are known that could perform the above functions. The Sealevel card, cable and driver were exclusively used during Compliance and Certification testing of the PDA-184 software via dedicated SATCOM, DAMA SATCOM and LOS using SINCGARS, and Have Quick.

 This special notice is not a Request for Proposal and may constitute the only official notice of this action.

<SUBJECT>39 -- FPI - FSC Code 3990
<DESC>Under the provisions of FPI's guidelines process, published March 12, 1997, in the Federal Register and March 25, 1997, in the Commerce Business Daily, FPI submits the following "good faith" announcement for public notice and comment.  FPI proposes to manufacture wood pallets for sale competitively to the Department of Defense (DOD), without mandatory source.

Under FPI's guidelines covering the production of new products and significant expansion of existing products, the primary determinant of what constitutes a "specific product" is an item's Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code.  Wood pallets fall within Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code 3990 - Miscellaneous Materials Handling Equipment.   FPI has recorded sales in this category every year since FY 1992.  In addition, FPI currently provides refurbished wood pallets internally.  The most appropriate SIC codes for wood pallets is SIC 2448 - Wood Pallets and Skids or NAICS code 321920 - Wood Container and Pallet Manufacturing.  FPI has not made items in these SIC and NAICS codes. 

FPI has a history of making similar items in the FSC code for wood pallets.  For this reason, FPI believes wood pallets do not meet the definition of "new product" set forth by FPI's guidelines. However, FPI recognizes that a reasonable person may construe this item to be a product separate and distinct from any other made by FPI. 

Under the terms of FPI's expansion guidelines, interested parties may submit comments regarding this proposed production by FPI.  In submitting comments to FPI, the following guidelines will apply:

1) Comments will be due within 21 days of the date of this notice;

2) Relevant comments will focus on and address why wood pallets should be considered a new product, separate and distinct from a similar item currently produced by FPI;

3) While the primary purpose of the comments will be to determine if the item should be defined as a new product, comments related to market share and/or the impact resulting from such a production decision may also be considered relevant.

All comments received in response to this announcement will be considered by FPI.  All commenters will be advised when FPI makes a final determination.  Any interested party has a right to raise any question at any time with FPI's Board of Directors. 

All comments should be addressed to:  Chief Administrative Officer, Planning, Research, and Activation Branch, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534.

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur.

As used in this clause: Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1)     The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section. (d) Special rule for related partnerships.     For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) Warrants; (ii) Options; (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; (iv) Convertible debt instruments; (v) Others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. (End of provision)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation, No. RFQ-NCI-50146-NE includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-05.  This equipment herein is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2 and this acquisition is being made in accordance with FAR 12.

The North American Industry Classification code is 334516, and the business size standard is 500 Employees.  However, this solicitation is not set-aside for small business.

Background:  The Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is currently using fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) to purify proteins in its Immunotoxin and Gene Discovery programs.  LMB seeks to purchase a system that will mimic the same operational parameters as the existing equipment in the laboratory to ensure a transparent transition of daily operations.  

Requirement:  The Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) system shall have flow rates of 0.01 to 20 mL/min at pressures up to 5 MPa.  The system must be equipped with a system pump, a mixer for precision gradient formation, an injection valve, UV/pH/conductivity monitor with fixed wavelength detection, a Fraction collector for collecting up 120 samples in 16 mm tubes and 8 samples in 30 mm tubes, a UNICORN software package, system start-up, and two (2) 25MPA valves. The system shall be able to purify biomolecules from complex starting materials derived from cell culture supematants, and recombinant protein expression systems; to perform separations based on a variety of sample characteristics, such as molecular weight, net surface charge, and hydrophobicity, while retaining biological activity; to automate the running of large, open columns on the system, as well as a variety of gel filtration media.  The system shall have a flow rate range of .05-20mls/min at pressures ranging from 0-700 psi. The resolution required may necessitate the use of very precise, shallow gradients, the system shall be a two-pump gradient system, with dynamic mixing, as evidence suggests that this configuration produces the highest accuracy and precision in gradient formation.  The wetted flow path of the system shall be inert to halides due to the LMB using salt buffers.  The system shall allow operation of the system at zero backpressure to ensure system compatibility with standard low pressure chromatography supports often used in affinity chromatography and other techniques.  The system software must allow automation programs to be time-based, volume-based, or column-volume based.  The system shall have the ability to operate in a cold room at 4 degrees C, while being controlled at ambient temperatures outside the cold room.  The system shall include a fraction collector which is fully integrated into the system and fully controllable via the system control software.  The fraction collector shall be able to collect into a variety of different containers such as 30mm, 18mm, 12mm tubes as well as microcentrifuge tubes and multi-well plates.  The fraction collector shall have an accumulator which will retain precious sample between tube changes. The system shall have 2 PV-908 valves to facilitate cleaning, storage, selection of our various chromatographic columns, and further automation.  The system shall have the ability to be sanitized without removing columns and possibly introducing air into the system.  The motorized valves should provide feedback to the control system to ensure proper orientation of all valves, and documentation of valve positions at all times.  The valves shall be driven electronically and require no external air or pressure to operate.  The system software shall allow the user to be entering details of the next purification at the same time the current separation is being done, or to simultaneously be integrating and evaluating the results of earlier runs.  The system software shall have the ability to control up to nine motorized valves, chart recorder, fraction collector, dynamic gradient mixer, air sensors, and three pumps. The pumps, UV and conductivity monitors, valves and fraction collector shall all be specified for use in a cold room at 4 degrees C as well as room temperature.  The software shall accept input signals (e.g. UV wavelength, conductivity, pH, temperature, pressure, flow, Analog signals).  Software shall be capable of plotting, and integrating these signals, as well as using them to trigger sub-routines in the programming when the signal exceeds a preset threshold to allow the automation of multi-dimensional separations.  The system shall include one automatic three-position injection valve (load, inject, and was positions), which shall allow for sample loading onto the column.  The system software shall allow for automation of the optimization of separation parameters (e.g. sample volume, flow rate, gradient slope).  This automation shall allow a small amount of sample to be consumed in optimizing the purification scheme, after which the best regime can be scaled upon the same LC system.  Column equilibration before and after sample injection and elution shall be capable of being monitored, with a feed-back loop to the control system, so LMB can be certain equilibration is completed, without consuming excess volume of sometimes expensive buffers.  The system shall be delivered inside building 37, room 5117B and installed, as well as basic training on the system for up to 6 users, adequate to insure that members of LMB will be able to use the system independently.

The Chromatography system shall be delivered FOB destination to the The Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in Bethesda, Maryland and be up and running with ALL specified performance features intact and installed no later than 30 days after receipt of order. 

Offerors must provide descriptive literature, or other materials that demonstrate that their offer meets the foregoing requirements.  The contract will be awarded to the responsible offeror with the lowest price offer that fully meets the requirements of the solicitation.

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETION
DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
12TH CONTRACTING SQUADRON
RANDOLPH AFB TX 78150-4525

(i) 	Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency’s needs:

The proposed action is for the purchase of a ColorSpan 60” DisplayMaker model 72 SR inject, solvent printer and related accessories for use in the Graphics Branch support of numerous customers at Randolph AFB TX to include HQ AETC, HQ AFPC, HQ Recruiting Service and other 12 FTW tenants.
     
(ii)	Statutory Authority:  FAR 6.302-1 (c) - Application for brand name      
             descriptions.  

(iii)	A demonstration that the proposed contractor’s unique qualification or the 
            nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:  

Currently we are not able to produce large displays for the Wing and Command that are long lasting and capable of being displayed outdoors in harsh environment.  Present printing technology/equipment is designed to produce only indoor products with a limited ability for long lasting use.  This manufacturer is the only product capable of providing 60” solvent-ink printer.  The Multimedia Center has been using this brand (indoor inks) for the last three (3) years.  Failure to maintain this environment will introduce undetermined complications from hardware mixtures that will significantly increase the complexity of maintaining existing configuration control of these critical devices.  Substantial man-hours have been spent on training of personnel a well as costs incurred in the acquisition of the current printer.  The Air Force will not need to reinvest in specific training for another brand of printer.  Additionally, due to the humidity problems that exist in hangar 6, the above printer is best suited for this environment.  The system includes a self-cleaning and sensor system, which results in less waste of supplies and manpower.  This printer can print on rigid poster boards to roll-to-roll flexible media, such as vinyl, canvas, paper and fabrics.  The printer is capable of utilizing archival ink and print products giving the end product longer shelf life.  This would realize a cost savings of approximately $28,000 and half to three-quarters production time.  The government has expended approximately $215,000 for the current ColorSpan (indoor ink) printer.  It would be cost prohibitive and not in the best interest of the government to procure this printer from a different manufacturer.

(iv)       A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or  
                 overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for 
                 the supplies or services is required:  

Until it is determined that the current printer no longer meets the Government’s requirements, the ColorSpan 72 SR inkjet will be utilized.  In addition, until other firms can provide compatibility with the existing system, to include upgrades that meet the Government’s needs, it would be neither reasonable nor feasible to consider any other brand.  To ensure the above is met, 12 CS/SCSG will however, continue to evaluate the capabilities of other manufacturer’s through continuing market research and the changing needs of the current system.  Continued efforts in this regard will ensure that the Government is getting the best value at a fair and reasonable price by ensuring the Government utilizes the most efficient and economical components and support

Contracting Officer’s Certification:  The contents of this justification and approval are certified as accurate and complete to the best of the Contracting Officer’s knowledge and belief.

Technical personnel certification of accuracy:   The supporting data that forms the basis of this justification has been certified to be complete and accurate, to the best of their knowledge and belief, by the technical/requirements organization.

<DESC>This amendment is issued to respond to the folloiwng question:
In regards to Question 1: I am checking with you to see if you need a separate Stand Alone Heavy Level IV plate. Or, do you need the inconjuction with plate.

This means...you wear the plate with soft body armor to achieve Level IV protection. ( This is the most common ). It is also lighter.

Response:     These plates will be used in a Level III vest to achieve Level IV protection.

If you demand a Level III vest for the SAPI this could be problematic since a Level III vest is not a soft vest. This Level III vest also contains plates. The soft vest is Level IIIA with pockets for inserting the SAPI panels. It would seem more logical that the Level IV SAPI require a Level IIIA vest.

Response:  The response is changed to read these plates will be used with a Level IIIA vest to provide Level IV protection.  Ceramic, lightweight plates are needed. Fronts only.

The due date is changed to 9/6/05 at 1:00pm.  If a response has been submitted please respond with revised quotations.
