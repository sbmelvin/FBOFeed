<DESC>The goal of the Large Tactical Sensor Networks program is to develop and demonstrate software algorithms and technologies to function with capabilities utilized by units at the tactical level.  These sensor algorithms and technologies will function in a net-centric enterprise Service Oriented Architecture environment, when applicable, to provide users with automation for the intelligent management of sensing of multi-INT resources and fusion of data in near real-time (NRT) to support the user’s mission needs against an asymmetric threat.  The program will develop software tools that will work with the sensors for smart sensor data processing and enable sensor tagging and tracking of entities. 

The program is structured around the following thrust areas:  

• Designing tools for mission specific tactical sensor fields capable of fulfilling specific mission objectives
• Developing smart tactical sensors, platforms and algorithms capable of forwarding information/knowledge vice raw data
• Creating a service oriented sensor network (SOA) for expeditionary forces’ current and future tactical sensors 
• Creating fusion tools capable of translating tactical sensor data into appropriate situational awareness for expeditionary forces in near real-time.  This includes developing knowledge discovery engines and automatic alerts that enable the "right information" to be pushed/pulled and creating alerts for time sensitive warning.
• Designing autonomous platforms and automatic sensor planning and management tools to ensure that the right data is collected by the right sensor in support of intelligence requirements 
• Developing tailored tactical Human to Machine Interfaces aligned to primary operational functions and non-intrusive within the battlespace and
• Creating services for the tactical network that are fully operable with DCGS and the DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB)
 
White Papers are encouraged prior to submitting a full proposal.  White papers will be evaluated to determine whether an offeror is encouraged to make an oral presentation of its white paper to a panel of Government evaluators.  An offeror may submit a full proposal without submitting a white paper or making an oral presentation.

Approximately $25M is available in FY07 for efforts over a 1-3 year timeframe.  ONR plans to issue an annual BAA for this program.  The total funding for the program is anticipated to be $84M during FY07-FY11.

<DESC>TITLE:  PRODUCTION OF GASTIPS PUBLICATION. DESC:  The U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA intends to award a purchase order on a sole-source basis to Hart Energy Publishing, LP, Houston, TX for the GasTIPS quarterly technical journal in accordance with the statement of work listed below. STATEMENT OF WORK Three issues of GasTIPS will be produced during calendar year 2006 and distributed in or about the months of May, July, and September.  A fourth publication will be produced and distributed between December 2005 and February 2007.  The publicationâ€™s size, cover and layout will be substantially similar to the current GasTIPS publication, with such modifications as may be necessary to acknowledge the contributions and reflect the status of other joint sponsors. Each issue will be mailed to the then-current GasTIPS mailing list of approximately 9,500 names, with such additions and deletions due to new subscriptions and reader attrition as may occur during 2004.  Copies may be mailed to additional reader lists as may be deemed appropriate by the joint sponsors.  Each issue will be mailed to Western hemisphere subscribers free of charge, but subscribers for issues mailed to non-Western hemisphere locations may be charged. NETL will have the right to provide, on an alternating basis, either three (3) or four (4) technical articles per issue on topics concerning natural gas exploration, production, processing, or related topics.  These articles will be of a length comparable to past GasTIPS articles.  The publisher will provide writing and editing assistance to NETL authors as necessary, and NETL will provide information in a timely fashion.  Non-NETL content for each issue of GasTIPS will be provided by other joint sponsors and/or the publisher. NETL submissions will be subject to a final review by NETL before printing.  An editorial calendar and submission schedule will be determined by mutual agreement of the joint sponsors. The Editorsâ€™ Commentary column in each issue will be developed jointly by the publisher and the joint sponsors.  The joint sponsors will approve the column text before publication. The publisher will supply to NETL, in PDF format, all articles that appear in each issue, for publication on the NETL website, on or shortly after the publication date of each issue. If NETL desires, the publisher will tip in one 4-page (or less) insert into any issue, providing that NETL supplies the insert to the publisherâ€™s printer in a timely fashion prior to the mailing date.  The publisher may permit other joint sponsors to provide inserts and/or use the mailing list in ways deemed appropriate by the joint sponsors. The publisher will provide to NETL an additional 500 copies of each issue, shipped to a single domestic U.S. location specified by NETL. (This will be the NETL library in Morgantown, WV, unless otherwise directed by NETL.) NETL can obtain additional copies at cost if sufficient notice is given prior to printing. In return for the services described above, NETL will remit to the publisher a fixed payment per issue.  The publisher will submit an invoice to NETL for payment following the publication of each issue. NETL is a trademark of the U.S. Department of Energy, and its use as well as the use of any other trademarked names within the GasTIPS publication will continue to be so noted. This purchase order is to be issued to the Hart Energy Publishing, LP because the vendor is uniquely qualified to conduct the project since it is the current publisher of GasTIPS and has an established subscriber list and an ongoing relationship with acknowledged leaders in the Gas Industry.  There is no other known source that can effectively disseminate the results and policy information to the Gas Technology Community.  The participation in this project is relevant to the DOE mission as key areas of gas exploration and production topics. This request is considered to be sole source to the Hart Energy Publishing LP. Therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement.  This award is set aside small business and shall be awarded using FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by this agency.  Offerors shall provide sufficient technical literature, documents, etc., in order for the Government evaluation team to make an adequate technical assessment of the quote as meeting technical acceptability.  Request for information should be addressed to Mr. Robert L. Mohn, FAX 412-386-5770.  The Technical Representative for the above requirement is Mr. Gary Sames, PHONE: 412-386-5067.  All bids, proposal, or quotations must be received by 5:00 PM Eastern Time, May 16, 2006.

Small high-technology firms are encouraged to submit proposals to DoD for R&D projects with both military and commercial applications in response to SBIR solicitation 2006.2, which was publicly released on the DoD SBIR Web Site (http://www.acq.osd.mil/sadbu/sbir) on May 1, 2006.   The 2006.2 SBIR Solicitation will open for receipt of proposals on June 14, 2006 and will close at 6:00 AM EST, July 14, 2006.  NOTE:  Proposals received after the specified due date and time shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3).  Submissions must include the proposal cover sheets, technical proposal, Company Commercialization Report, and cost proposal to be considered a complete proposal. Four DoD components will participate in the 2006.2 solicitation – the Department of the Army, Department of Navy, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and Special Operations Command.  The solicitation lists all the R&D topics under which DoD is seeking proposals, and also contains detailed information on the parameters of the SBIR program and how to submit a proposal.  Small firms apply first for a six-month phase I award of $70,000 to $100,000 (unless otherwise specified in the component instructions) to test the scientific, technical, and commercial merit of a particular concept.  If phase I proves successful, the firm may be invited to apply for a two-year phase II award of $500,000 to $750,000 to further develop the concept.  Proposals must be submitted via the DOD SBIR website at “http://www.dodsbir.net/submission” following the instructions contained in the solicitation, including the instructions specified in the solicitation for the DoD component to which you are applying.  Offerors bear the risk of website inaccessibility due to heavy usage in the final hours before the solicitation closing time, so plan ahead and submit early.  The complete solicitation may be accessed at http://www.dodsbir.net/solicitation.  Participation in the DoD SBIR Program is restricted to small business firms organized for profit with 500 or fewer employees, including all affiliated firms.

<DESC>The Program Support Center on behalf of the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) intends to negotiate and award a contract to the National Association of Protection & Advocacy Systems (NAPAS) on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.    The Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD) administers programs under the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights (DD) Act of 2000. 

The purpose of this contract would be to continue technical assistance to the 57 State Protection and Advocacy (P&A) Agencies whose mission is to protect the human and civil rights and interests of individuals with disabilities, including developmental disabilities and mental illness.    The goal of this assistance is to improve program performance (increase self-advocacy and build capacity), statutory compliance and program outcomes across the state P&A systems.  This contract will enable technical assistance to the P&A Agencies that protect the interests of individuals with cognitive, mental and physical disabilities.  

This technical assistance covers a wide array of training, consultation, information dissemination, best practices and capacity building, and legal and advocacy-based training. 

NAPAS is the 57 P&As’ national membership organization.  NAPAS serves as a clearinghouse and a core from which emanates ideas, issues, potential challenges and solutions and information exchange.  NAPAS provides cohesiveness  across the 57 P&As in thwarting challenges to the human and civil rights of individuals  with disabilities, including developmental disabilities and mental illness.  The 57 P&As view NAPAS as a trusted source and resource for cutting edge, state of the art approaches to legal and advocacy activities.  NAPAS has a unique insight into the needs of the P&As across the country.  The training and technical assistance for the P&As requires an entity with the in depth knowledge and understanding of the operations and needs of the P&As.  Since NAPAS is the P&As’ membership organization, NAPAS has the unique insight and experience to provide the training and technical assistance as well as the legal advocacy to the P&As.    The 57 P&As view NAPAS as their hub for legal and advocacy services.  NAPAS is uniquely qualified to provide training and technical assistance across the P&A system because the 57 P&As have invested time, money and effort to develop a membership organization they can trust and depend on to provide them support they need to achieve their mission:  protect the human and civil rights of individuals with disabilities, including mental illness.  There is no other entity with the innate and unique ability to provide appropriate training and technical assistance to the 57 P&A systems across the United States.

The period of performance for the contract shall be a base year plus four option years.  

Any contractors that may have the requisite qualifications to perform the work describe above, should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government’s requirements.  The statement of capabilities must specifically demonstrate the following:  (1) demonstrated experience in providing legal and advocacy-based training to the Protection and Advocacy Systems; (2) demonstrated experience of organizational structure and management of Protection and Advocacy Systems; (3)  demonstrated experience in conducting workshops and conferences; (4) demonstrated experience with Protection and Advocacy Systems measurement of outcomes and reporting processes; (5) ability to provide staff that has proven successful academic and professional work experiences in the field of developmental, emotional and other significant disabilities; proven ability to direct and mange projects of this magnitude including accounting/bookkeeping; proven experience in providing and coordinating training and technical assistance activities; and proven experience in managing contracts or programs for training and technical assistance as a project director.

No solicitation document is available.     Capability statements must be submitted within 45 days of the publication of this synopsis to the contact point and address given above.    If no capability statements are received which specifically demonstrate the requirements above, the Government shall proceed with a sole source contract to NAPAS.

<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to issue an Invitation for International Bidding (IFIB) for a Five Year Lease (subject to approval of annual funding) for managed fiber optic services, including provision of active equipment at NC3A sites and at regeneration sites, over the existing fiber optic network of the bidder. The lease term of the services and active equipment shall be for 5 years (60 months) with an option to extend the lease in increments of 12 months up to a maximum of ten years (120 months). The work will also include installation of fiber tail links to NC3A premises from the nearest access point of the bidder in the Hague and Brussels, with an Indefeasible Right of Use (IRU) by NC3A for each of the fiber tail links for a period of fifteen (15) years.

NC3A is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. The contract award shall be to the lowest priced bid that is compliant with the terms of the IFIB. Partial bidding is not authorized. 

The estimated value of this project is not available. The reference of the Invitation for International Bid (IFIB) is IFIB-NC3A-TH-06-001. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same IFIB reference.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

Bidding documents are required to be NATO UNCLASSIFIED. Performance of the contract will not require contractor personnel to have security clearances.  

NC3A intends to procure managed fiber optic services to provide a dedicated fiber optic link between its two main locations:

- Oude Waalsdorperweg 61, 2597AK Den Haag, Netherlands
   (Geolocation: N52.10923 E4.32493)
- Avenue du Bourget 140, 1100 Brussels, Belgium
   (Geolocation: N50.87470 E4.43004)

The straight-line distance between these two sites is approximately 137 km. The road distance between these two sites is approximately 187 km.

The intended use of the fiber optic link is to carry a variety of data communications services between the two sites, such as:

- Traditional LAN services (e-mail, web, file access)
- Intersite telephony (ISDN channels in the short term; Voice over IP in the longer term)
- Video Teleconferencing
- FiberChannel for backup of the Storage Area Networks at both sites

NC3A will use Coarse Division Wavelength Multiplexing (CWDM) to divide the fiber link into a maximum of eight channels in the band from 1471 nm to 1611 nm at speed up to and including 2.5 Gbit/sec per channel.

Each CWDM channel will be secured by network cryptographic devices to be provided by NC3A. Operational speeds will therefore be limited by the performance of the crypto black interface. Initially (early 2006) this will be limited to 100 Mbps (IP crypto, Ethernet interface). In the course of 2006, NC3A expects to upgrade to 1 Gbps IP cryptos. NC3A is investigating the use of other devices that encrypt protocols other than IP, such as FiberChannel or SONET. Contractor should plan for channel speeds up to 2.5 Gbps as improved network cryptos become available in the future.

The contractor shall specify, procure, install and maintain CWDM equipment (Active Equipment) for the NC3A premises and for the Regeneration Sites that conforms to ITU-T G.695 (Optical Interfaces for Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing applications). The equipment will include an Optical Distribution Frame with Optical mux/demux, pluggable laser transceivers, interfaces to NC3A equipment that support 100 Mbps and 1 Gbps Ethernet, monitoring and management software, and any on-site spares needed to assure rapid repair in the event of a fault. The CWDM equipment shall be highly reliable, equipped with dual power supplies, and shall be easily maintainable by contractor maintenance personnel.

Initially two CWDM channels will be operated:

- Channel 1 will be Business as Usual Ethernet
- Channel 2 will be SAN Backup running Fiber Channel (either native or over IP)

Depending on the performance of the SAN backup process, it may be necessary to operate a third independent channel, also for Fiber Channel. In future, other channels may be operated for other purposes as NC3A needs dictate.

Given the physical distance between the two NC3A sites and the intended us of CWDM equipment, two Regeneration Sites and suitable Active Equipment for regeneration will be required. These sites and equipment shall be provided by the contractor. They are hereafter referred to as Regeneration Site North (RSN) and Regeneration Site South (RSS).

NC3A will consider this managed fiber service to be business critical. It must be available on a 24/7 basis, with minimum downtime for planned - and unplanned - outages. The contractor must provide adequate means to define and maintain a satisfactory level of service and to respond promptly to faults.

Only a single fiber pair is required from end to end, not a ring. NC3A will provide a backup path that is geographically and technically different to the required fiber link. NC3A will be responsible for automatic fail-over from the primary fiber link to the backup link.

The U.S. Department of Commerce will provide a PDF copy of the complete Statement of Work upon request. Send your request to Lcarpent@bis.doc.gov.

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Embassy, which in turn forwards it to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the Invitation for International Bidding (IFIB) has been issued. 
 
IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Department of Commerce to submit a Declaration of Eligibility on your behalf: 23 May 2006

2. Anticipated date that the Host Nation will forward the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) to those on the Bidders List: May 2006

3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: July 2006

4. Anticipated contract award date: 3rd quarter of 2006

FAR Clauses: 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications. (Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation wi!  ll contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN). The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather infor!  mation you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official  version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help).  52.212-4  Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders within this clause.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a contract to Carleton Technologies Inc., Tampa, Florida to refurbish, assemble, test, and deliver 282 upgraded MK 16 MOD 1 Underwater Breathing Apparatus making it the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Next Generation Underwater Breathing Apparatus (NUBA).   This procurement includes spare parts and soft goods kits to maintain the NUBA for a minimum of two years.   Under this contract effort, Carleton Technologies will also provide testing support services to verify Environmental Conditions, Transportability, Electromagnetic Interference, and Influence Signature requirements.  Carleton Technologies will also provide the necessary labor and resources required to establish and perform interim depot level (D-level) maintenance and repair support.   Finally, Carleton Technologies will provide Operators and Maintenance training sufficient to provide the necessary information, skill development, and pr!  actical application required by the student to set up, check out, operate and perform preventative maintenance on the NUBA.   These NUBAs are being refurbished and reconfigured for delivery to the fleet.   The Requirements Document for Next Generation Underwater Breathing Apparatus identifies the need for EOD forces to destroy and/or neutralize underwater mines.  The Mk 16 Mod 1 is currently fulfilling this need, but is doing so with reduced reliability and long dive setup times.  The MK 16 Mod 1 is an analog, electronically controlled, fully closed circuit, mixed gas, constant partial pressure breathing apparatus.  The upgrade will modernize the electronics to a digital system, increasing reliability while reducing dive setup time and cost.  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  Carleton Technologies is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the MK 16 UBA.  As the OEM, only Carleton Technologies can accurately perform all of the refurbishments a!  nd upgrades to the MK 16 to successfully transition the system to NUBA .  The Mk16 is a certified life support system.  As such, only approved components can be used on the system.  In summary, Carleton Technologies is the only responsible source due to their unique qualifications as sole manufacturer of the MK16 UBA.  Use of another company to refurbish and reconfigure the currently fielded UBAs would result in extensive requalification and certification testing which is cost and time prohibitive. NAICS Code:  541990, Size Standard:  500.    A contract will be awarded on or about Jul 06 on the basis of the proposal submitted in response to the RFP.  Numbered Note 22 applies to this announcement.  NSWC PC plans on releasing the solicitation electronically only.   The point of contact is Contract Specialist: April Irby, Code XPS2, NSWC PC, 100 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, Fl 32407-7001.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source contract to Carleton Life Support, 3910 Riga Boulevard, Tampa, Florida 33619 for the acquisition of one (1) Naval Special Warfare (NSW) MK 16 Underwater Breathing Apparatus (UBA) Digital Electronics Package  (p/n 2403-P05) and the acquisition of  five (5)  MK 16 Mod 0 Oxygen Hand Valves, five (5)  MK 16 Mod 0 Diluent Hand Valves, five (5)  MK 16 Mod 0 Oxygen Regulators, and five (5)  MK 16 Mod 0 Diluent Regulators.  The MK 16 Mod 0 Underwater Breathing Apparatus is used by Naval Special Warfare (NSW) divers in the Seal Delivery Vehicle (SDV).  Current electronics enables the UBA status to be shown to the diver via a primary display (worn on the left forearm) and the secondary display (worn on the right forearm).  Both displays connect to the UBA with cables.  Two pressure gauges, also connected to the UBA by cables, show the pressure remaining in each of the two breathing gas flasks. !   The digital electronics package being acquired, combines four of these displays into a single unit, thereby reducing the number of cables.  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  Carleton Life Support Technologies is the sole manufacturer of the MK 16 Mod 0 UBA, and is the only company that has a version of the digital electronics in production.  Therefore, this acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition. Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City Beach, FL 32407-7018.  NAICS Code541990 applies. SBA Size Standard is 500 employees.   FSC is 4220.  A request for quotation will be utilized in awarding this action on or about 13 May 2006.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for a cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) counter instrument system. The system must include the CCN spectrometer, test cables, shipping case, one day of training at manufacturer’s facility and a one year warranty. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Droplet Measurement Technologies (DMT), who is the only known source who can meet Agency requirements. The cloud condensation nuclei counter instrument will be used for aerosol climatology measurements. The instrument design was developed and patented by the University of California at San Diego and is licensed for production exclusively by DMT.  It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to offer a similar product that would meet this requirement.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 16, 2006. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

THIS REQUEST IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY, AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, A SOLICITATION, A REQUEST FOR QUOTES, OR AN INDICATION THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTRACT FOR THE ITEMS CONTAINED IN THE RFI.     THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT REIMBURSE RESPONDENTS FOR ANY COST ASSOCIATED WITH SUBMISSION OF THE INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED OR REIMBURSE EXPENSES INCURRED TO INTERESTED PARTIES FOR RESPONSES TO THIS RFI. The USAF Electronic Systems Center 642nd Electronic Systems Squadron (642ELSS, formerly the Force Protection System Squadron) at Hanscom Air Force Base is supporting the Security Equipment Integration Working Group (SEIWG), which is a standing subcommittee of the Physical Security Equipment Action Group (PSEAG).  The PSEAG is the central manager for Physical Security Equipment (PSE) Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funding within DOD.  SEIWG membership includes the US Air Force (USAF), US Army (USARMY), US Navy (USNAVY), and the US Marine Corps (USMC). Its mission is to coordinate and influence system architecture, technical design, and systems integration of all PSE to be used within the Department of Defense.  One of SEIWG’s efforts is the development of a common Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP) Technical Standard Profile (TV-1) to be used by the four services for future acquisition of PSE. This is an integral part of the process of developing a joint PSE technical architecture for application to all DOD PSE design and acquisition efforts. The USAF through the 642nd Electronic Systems Squadron (642ELSS) is serving SEIWG as the Lead DoD organization in standardizing device interfaces for the SEIWG. To ensure that the industry is aware of our efforts in developing a common list of standards to be used for physical security equipment, and to ensure that the maximum number of vendor’s equipment can be accommodated in our security solutions, we are soliciting comments on this draft technical standards profile.  Information provided by the vendor may be shared with the US Army, the US Navy, the US Marine Corps, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Energy, and the four IBDSS contractors under the terms of USAF Contract Nos.

(1) Formatting, printing and reproduction of sufficient numbers of all sets of survey questionnaires; 
(2) Development of a Computer Assisted Telephone Instrument (CATI) version of each of the Medicare health plan type questionnaires to enable collection of the survey by telephone both for sample members to call into the toll-free contractor-provided telephone number dedicated to the survey as well as for calls made by the contractor in telephone follow-up to non-respondents to the mail survey; 
(3) Preparation of a CATI training manual for telephone interviewers as well as the training of sufficient numbers of interviewers to conduct the CATI surveys; (4) Inputting data from the completed returned mail survey questionnaires through the use of an optical scanning machine that reads each page of the completed surveys and captures responses; 
(5) Preparation of electronic data files to be prepared from the results of the Medicare CAHPS data collection efforts according to specifications provided to the contractor by CMS and the CMS CAHPS Analytic contractor.    
  
This procurement will be set aside for Small Businesses.  It is anticipated that this competition will result in one award.  The period of performance will be a base year plus four (4) one-year options.

Upon receipt of a work request  (i.e. delivery order or work assignment), the Contractor shall check this listing of directives (see paragraph (d) for electronic access).     The applicable directives for performance of the work request are those in effect on the date of issuance of the work request. (1) IRM Policies, Standards  and Procedures.  The 2100 Series (2100-2199) of the Agency's Directive System contains the majority of the Agency's IRM policies, standards and procedures.  (2) Groundwater Program IRM Requirement.     A contractor performing any work related to collecting Groundwater data; or developing or  enhancing data bases containing Groundwater quality data shall comply with EPA Order 7500.1A - Minimum Set of Data Elements for Groundwater. (3) EPA Computing and Telecommunications Services.

Due date for receipt of responses to this RFQ will be 4:30 PM/EST,  05/11/06 to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, ATTN:     Nicole Humphrey 3803R,     Washington, DC 20460 via U.S. Mail; or to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, ATTN:     Nicole Humphrey, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Reagan Building Room 71279, Washington, DC  20004 via commercial delivery; or e-mail at humphrey.nicole@epa.gov.     Electronic responses are preferred.  Point of     contact:     Nicole Humphrey, Contract Specialist, Phone (202) 564-4379.  	Brand Name Justification: EPA must limit the procurement of video conferencing equipment to one  manufacturer, Tandberg.  Tandberg is the only system that is approved by the EPA's Office of Environmental Information.  The software and standard conversion document currently in place only allows Tandberg IP equipment to gain access to the Agency's network for security reasons.  The required  system would need both IP and ISDN capabilities as our partners with whom we communicate use both IP and ISDN and sometimes solely IP.  Therefore, since the Agency's standard conversion protocol does not allow other manufacturers on the network via IP, must limit the system to Tandberg only.

NGST was the sole designer and developer of the GrIIM RePr which uses RePLACE technology. This effort is an extension of the GrIIM RePr development and will require updates to the old L-304 software already developed and used in the E-2C Group II Operational Flight Program (OFP). This will require access to the previously developed GrIIM RePr RePLACE emulation to which NGST solely holds the data rights.  The contractor will be tasked to update and test in-house the GpII software and provide changes to the PSA GpII SSA in San Diego for final integration.   See Note 22.

Date for receipt of proposals:  July 18, 2006

The National Transit Institute is seeking proposals from qualified professionals to facilitate and modify, as required, its newly revised Public Involvement in Transportation Decision Making course.

Public Involvement in Transportation Decision Making is a three-day course that introduces the principles and practices of public involvement to those who carry out and to those who are affected by transportation projects.  The course provides a basic familiarity with public involvement requirements and the strategies that can meet the requirements.  More importantly, the course delves into the underlying motivations, attitudes, and organizational and individual values that motivate effective public participation.  The course is designed to demonstrate elements of the course content through the use of techniques discussed to convey the knowledge and skills being taught.  This allows for mutually reinforcing reflection on both the process and the content.

To obtain a copy of the complete Request for Proposal, send a written request on organization letterhead to the University Procurement & Contracting address above. Fax or e-mail requests will be accepted; telephone requests are unacceptable. Requests will be honored if received by June 6, 2006.                    .

Rutgers University is an equal opportunity employer and is committed to provide opportunities to small business, minority-owned businesses and/or female-owned businesses. These businesses are encouraged to submit proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The government intends to procure one commercially available High Energy Digital X-ray Imaging System capable of imaging test items 16 feet in length and weighing up to 12,000 pounds from Envision Product Design, Anchorage, AK to aid in its mission o f inspecting and evaluating components associated with weapon systems. The high energy digital x-ray imaging system shall consist of but is not limited to the following components: 9 MeV Linear accelerator, CMOS High-Resolution Linear scanning array,  Movement system for Imaging Platform, Precision Movement stage for Linear Array, Movement System for Linear Accelerator Platform, Cabling system, Industrial Workstation with card sets and dual displays, Imaging Software Package, Custom Software for Motion Controls Stages, On site system installation and training,  Automated Stands for Part Support and Handling, Relational Data base software. The government requires an imaging system with the best possible image quality. The Statement of Work includes Component Performance Standards. Envision Product Designs Complementary Metal Oxide Silicon (CMOS) detectors have better spatial resolution and higher fill factor than similar technologies. The Envision product achieves greater sensitivity and signal noise ratios, a linear accelerator with higher radiation output than any other and their off axis arrangement of scanning array reduces the noise pro blem and detector degradation associated with other technologies. This also eliminates blooming and latent images. The scanning technique employed by Envision eliminates the radiographic parallax along the scan direction which eliminates the positional unc ertainty of interior components of the test item and also makes possible to produce an image of unlimited length. The format height is determined by the array length, other designs have finite format sizes. There is no other source that manufactures a digi tal x-ray imaging product that will satisfy all agency requirements. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be fully considered by the agency. Point of contact is Andy Eiermann, Contract Specialist, telephone 256-876-3841, e-mail andy.e iermann@redstone.army.mil.

<DESC>Marine Aviation Weapons and Tactics Squadron One (MAWTS-1) has incorporated the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) into Desert Talon exercise curriculums. Air space restrictions and the requirement to fly unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) missions over populated towns dictates the use of manned aerial vehicles that simulate the Predator  UAV to provide Predator quality video from a sensor aboard the aircraft to a simulated (or actual) Predator ground control station.  This type of platform is known as a Surrogate Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (SUAV). The Contractor shall provide SUAV support and consulting services for development of  Desert Talon exercise planning.  Support is estimated to be approximately five days of flight operations during each class.  The Desert Talon Operation will be conducted 7 Jun 2006 through 23 Jun 2006.  Any set up, test, and tear down days are in addition to the five days of support.  A typical flight day will require one mission, eight hours i!  n length, during a 12 hour training evolution.  Additional crews may be required to accommodate longer days in accordance with the planned exercise.  The exercise will occur in the Yuma, AZ, operating area, however, other areas such as Twenty Nine Palms or other military ranges within California, Nevada, or Arizona may be used.  SUAV mission requirements may dictate that the aircraft occasionally land at military facilities or different commercial facilities between missions, therefore, a current Department of Defense Civilian Landing Permit (DD Form 2401) is required to perform this work.      AIRCRAFT PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS: The contractor shall provide an aircraft that meets the following minimum characteristics: (1) Capable of providing a service ceiling of a minimum 14,000 feet mean sea level (2)Capable of operating in all instrument conditions, day and night (except in known icing conditions) (3) Mission profile must deliver eight hours of total airborne time with payload (7.5 at night) and at least 110 knots dash speed (4) The SUAV must fly with a Predator class camera, minimum 14 inch skyball or bigger. GROUND CONTROL STATION REQUIREMENTS:  The contractor shall provide a Ground Control Station the meets the following minimum characteristics: (1) Must be capable of fully controlling the Optical Sensor on board the Aircraft at ranges up to 65 nautical miles (2)GCS must display video and targeting and aircraft location data (3)GCS must have a minimum VHF and UHF communication capability for communicating with the aircraft up to 65 nautical miles, and to loca!  l military commands (4) Must be able to transmit live video to a location designated a distance of up to 4 miles away from the GCS (5) Must have space available for a computer workstation (6) Must be self contained and stand alone capable.   OPTICAL SENSOR REQUIREMENT: The contractor shall provide an aircraft equipped with a fully articulated and stabilized camera system to include day color video, with a minimum 955mm Long-Range spotter lens, infrared, and carried simultaneously and selectable from the ground.  The purpose of the sensor is to emulate current and future UAV’s including the latest USAF Predator UAV, Army GNAT 750, Marine Corps Pioneer and the Navy Fire scout.  Usage of a manned vehicle simulating an unmanned vehicle provides the ability to fly over populated cities for training evolutions. The sensor must be compatible with Rover III. The sensor must be controlled from a Ground Control Station (GCS).   DATA LINK SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: The aircraft shall be equ!  ipped with a data link that is capable of sensor product delivery (ful l streaming video with overlay) to a full ground video receiver site and to a Rover III remote video terminal (also known as the L-3COM Multi-band Man pack Receiver). The minimum data link range from the GCS to the aircraft is 65 nautical miles.  The link must be capable of operating in a frequency range allocated to the military.   UHF/VHF VOICE COMMUNICATION RELAY REQUIREMENTS: Aircraft and GCS shall be equipped with communication equipment for command and control.

<RESPDATE>060206
<CONTACT>Cuc Tran, (562) 626-7139
<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, San Diego, Seal Beach Division, is soliciting information for the purpose of identifying potential vendors for calibration equipment and systems meeting the general requirements identified in Attachment 1.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  There is no solicitation package available; the RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this RFI nor will the Government compensate the respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information for the Government. It is requested that information in response to this RFI be submitted NO LATER THAN 02 June 2006 to Ms. Cuc Tran, Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, San Diego, Seal Beach Division, 800 Seal Beach Blvd., Bldg 239, Seal Beach, CA 90740 or by e-mail at: cuc.tran@navy.mil.  Interested parties may provide any information (specifications, brochures, product application papers, etc) on current or emerging products that address the stated objectives to the above address. The information provided may or may not be used to assist the Government in formulating and refining its approach for addressing its needs.  Responses should also include the following:  (1) name and address of firm; (2) business size, including average annual revenue for past three years and number of employees; (3) ownership, indicating the following applicable business types:  large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), woman-owned, HUBZone, and/or Veteran owned; (4) number of years in business; and (5) company poi!  nt of contact, including name, title, phone, fax and e-mail address. The primary purpose of this RFI is to gather information on available and emerging Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) or Non-Developmental calibration equipment and systems that may potentially enable the objectives stated below.  Those responding to this request may categorize responses by identifying candidate products/technologies that currently exist, those currently under development, and those that can be planned and scheduled.  Interested parties may provide any information (specifications, brochures, product application papers, etc) on current or emerging products that address the stated objectives.  The information provided may or may not be used to assist the Government in formulating and refining its approach for addressing its needs. The Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC), Corona Division, in conjunction with the United States Marine Corps (USMC) Calibration Program Manager, is seeking information from industry on test equipment and standards to enhance the current capability existing in the mobile calibration facilities.  A new calibration facility will be developed which will encompass the current USMC ground support workload and also attempt to encompass new calibration parameters and capabilities for the next generation test equipment. In complying with DoD INST 5001, the Defense Acquisition System, there is concern that there exists an increased potential for hardware/software failures with the integration of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) items.  For that reason, the potential for system failures/losses and personnel health and safety has to be considered.  To assist the System Safety Engineers, any safety and other related documentation on prospective procurement items should be addressed as it can be factored into the procurement costs.  Industry Day: The Government will host an industry day on 17 May 2006 at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Corona Division, Corona, CA.  The purpose of the Industry Day is to provide interested parties an opportunity to walk through the current mobile calibration facility as well as provide an open forum discussion of the projected Marine Corps needs with the team of personnel that will be responsible for the selection process.  During the day, participants will be provided and opportunity to demonstrate and preview their test equipment and methodologies to the team.  The Point of Contact for the industry day is Maxie Perdue, Program Manager, NSWC Corona Division, (951) 273-5764, e-mail address:  maxie.perdue@navy.mil.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE.  The Solicitation Number for this announcement is N62467-06-R-0109.  Southern Division, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, solicits for Capability Statements from all qualified and interested parties with a priority on: Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business-first priority, 8a firms-second priority, and HubZone small business firms-third priority, to participate in a two-phase design and build solicitation for R01-99 North Seawall Repairs Phase 2 in NAS Corpus Christi, Texas.  The 2002 NAICS Code for the proposed acquisition is 237990, Seawall, wave protection, construction, and the small business size standard is $31 Mil. Federal Supply Code is Z249, Maintenance, Repair, and Alterations of Other Utilities.  Under FAR guidelines, the prime contractor must have the capability to perform at least 20 percent of the contract work with his-or-her own employees. The Government will use responses to this SOURCES SOUGHT market survey to make appropriate acquisition decisions to solicit this project as either a competitive Service Disabled Veteran Owned, 8a or HubZone Small Business or Unrestricted. The proposed acquisition will be a two-phase design-build solicitation.  Proposals will be evaluated using two-phase source selection procedures that will result in award of a firm-fixed price design/build contract to the responsible proposer whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is the BEST VALUE to the Government, price and technical factors considered.  Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase to a maximum of five offerors, design-build firms or teams, based on design-build factors.  Only those offerors selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  In Phase II, the competitive field will be required to submit technical and price proposals for the project.  The proposed project will consist of all design and construction work necessary to repair 4,285 LF of tied-back concrete-capped sheet pile seawall at NAS Corpus Christi using the super-jet grout method of ground improvement.  The contractor will stabilize and prolong the usable life of the seawall by providing overlapping super-jet grout columns approximately 10’ in diameter and 12’ deep along the length of the seawall.  The Contractor will be required to provide a boom on the outboard side of the seawall to contain byproducts of construction and will be required to remove and properly dispose of such byproducts.  The contractor will demolish portions of the existing reinforced concrete apron behind the seawall as necessary to provide ground improvements and will replace the apron with new reinforced concrete.  The contractor will daily clean and properly dispose of excess soil-cement that accumulates as a result of the jet grout process.  Work may also include repairs to the outboard face of the existing seawall’s concrete encasement, including removal of deteriorated concrete, cleaning and replacement deteriorated rebar, and the application of new concrete.  The estimated cost of this acquisition is between $3,068,000 and $3,749,000.  The Government invites contractors with the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements to submit Capability Statements consisting of appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references anticipated to be five to ten pages, following the set format.  Respondents must include references and a capability statement for at least two completed projects within the last three years of similar design/build work within the same dollar value magnitude of this notice adjusted for inflation. Each reference shall include the company name and title, telephone number, and point of contact.  Provide evidence of sufficient available bonding capacity with the name of bonding company, telephone number, and point of contact.  Indicate whether your firm was the prime contractor or subcontractor on other similar projects. The capability statements for each project should be numbered consistent with the below requirements followed by supporting documentation.  Offerors need to provide a list of projects by contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, and evidence of the following specific capabilities: 

1.	Recent and relevant federal government design and construction experience with Design/Build within the last 3 calendar years, for projects of similar size, scope, and complexity as a $4M Design/Build Seawall Repair Project.

2.	Recent and relevant design and construction experience repairing similar type seawalls using the super-jet grout technique. 

3.	Include proof of bonding capacity in excess of $4M.

4.	Provide proof of SBA certification for either 8a or HubZone status.

Any commercial brochures or currently existing marketing material may also be submitted with the Capabilities statement. Submission of Capabilities statement is not a prerequisite to any potential future offerings, but participation will assist the Navy in tailoring requirements to be consistent with industry capabilities. This market survey is for information and planning purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government will not pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. After completing its analysis, the Government will determine whether to limit competition among Service Disabled Veteran, 8a, or HubZone firms or proceed with full and open competition as Unrestricted.  Offers that do not meet all requirements or submit within the allotted time will not be considered.  Electronic submissions will be accepted.  The responses to this SOURCES SOUGHT market survey may be e-mailed to Kevin Logan at kevin.logan@navymil or mailed to Southern Division, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Attn: Kevin Logan, Code OPT2ACQKL, P.O.

I.	BACKGROUND

USAID/Benin is a sustainable development mission.  In 2003 the Mission is staffed with five Direct Hire Foreign Service Officers, four USPSCs, the health team advisor included, and 61 cooperating country nationals. The USAID/Benin program, with an annual operating year program budget of $16 million, includes strategic objectives in education, health, and a special objective in democracy/governance. The Mission also has a P.L. 480 Title II program which includes development interventions in primary education, maternal/child health, Agriculture, Child Trafficking, and village banking. 

Benin's population and health indicators are very poor. Child malnutrition is high, with 29% of children under 3 underweight, and treatable illnesses, such as malaria, diarrhea, and acute respiratory infections are the major causes of morbidity and mortality of children. Fertility rates and population growth are still high. Although the HIV prevalence rate is relatively low compared to other countries in the sub-region, it will rise rapidly without a coordinated and appropriate response. Segments of the population remain inadequately serviced by the public health system. While public health service coverage remains low,  the private health sector, both for-profit and not-for-profit, has grown rapidly, especially in urban areas. These trends present challenges to the role of the public sector and to public health policy. 

USAID's Strategic Objective in health focuses on health sector reform through the development of key policies, systems and tools, and their subsequent application on a pilot basis in two regions of the country. The strategic objective is to increase use of family health services and prevention measures within a supportive policy environment. 

The Mission's strategic objective program in family health is valued at approximately $63 million, and for the past 2 years, has had an annual budget of approximately $7.2 million.  This budget has been complemented by a yearly average of $4 million in Title II for food distribution and other activities related to maternal and child health.  The Mission's Family Health Program currently consists of thirteen activities, including a highly complex $12 million bilateral contract (ending early January 2004) for an integrated family health program and a $5 million social marketing program.  

A Foreign Service National (FSN) Population Health and Nutrition (PHN) Officer is currently the Leader of the FHT. He receives advice from a US Direct Hire General Development Officer (GDO) who will oversee both the health and education portfolios.

In addition to the DUCS contracted shelter care provider staff, ORR employs Central Office and Field staff who develop and implement policies and procedures; provide technical assistance, monitoring and oversight to grantees; identify and develop specialized capacity; and coordinate and oversee the family reunification of UAC.  ORR intends to acquire the services of bilingual Field Coordinators as third-party child welfare professionals to enhance, support and facilitate the work of DUCS Central Office and Field staff, particularly in the areas of family reunification, identification and analysis of trends and special needs, and placement recommendations.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), INVITATION FOR BID (IFB), REQUEST FOR QUOTES (RFQ), REQUEST FOR APPLICATION (RFA) OR AN ANNOUNCEMNT OF A SOLICITATION AND DOES NOT ASSUME THE GOVERNMENT WILL AWARD A CONTRACT OR PROCEED WITH ANY OF THE ABOVE SOLICITATIONS IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THIS NOTICE IS FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs (OASPA), is seeking capability statements from organizations with the core competencies necessary to develop and produce TV shows, interstitials and content for the Internet and digital mobile devices in a timely and cost effective manner.  The NAICS Code is 512110 and the size standard is $25.0 M.  In today’s world, any terrorist event, as well as a major natural disaster, is an instant national, if not international, story.  In the immediate moments after an event occurs, a host of activities begin to unfold in response to the consequences of the event.  Today, how the Government communicates with the media and the public about how it is responding to a crisis is just as important as how we deploy our physical assets.  In the pre-event “awareness, preparation and preparedness” phases of the event “life cycle,” there is a critical need to educate the public, the media, state and local officials, health care providers, and others with a basic understanding of how the Government responds to a crisis and what resources are available to these groups to meet their varied needs if disaster strikes, and, when speaking to the general public, it cannot be overstated.  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has created a way to reach the public with emergency preparedness, response, and mitigation information. HHS will program for the general public and will emerge as the most trusted source of health and emergency information to the media and general public.  To accomplish programming expectations, HHS will need to commission nationally recognized award-winning production companies and producers to develop and produce TV shows, interstitials and content for the Internet and digital mobile devices in a timely and cost effective manner. In the event of a national emergency, the Headquarters facility will serve as the central emergency broadcast center for the Department, delivering instantaneous on-air bulletins for emergency announcements that will be on air within minutes of our becoming aware of an emergency.  24/7 regularly scheduled TV and Web video programming will provide the American public with:  1) A place to turn for critical health-related emergency information when it's needed; 2) A new and authoritative source of objective, high-quality medical, health, and wellness television programming; 3) Awareness of the initiatives and priorities of America's health leadership; 4) Internet and new media information resources; and 5) “Push" technology alerts via email, PDA, podcast and other systems.  The contractor will produce complete programs at the HHS studio and/or remote locations.  Possible deliverables include: 1) Thirty-minute Nonfiction series-based programs comprised of 12 to 24 series, studio and location based. The series may include examples of dramatic, scripted or unscripted reenactments or programs developed to show what steps the general public should take in an emergency; 2) Thirty-minute and one hour Nonfiction Specials, studio and location based to include dramatic, scripted programs developed to show what steps the general public should take in an emergency.  These productions could also be reenactments of actual events in support of a “lessons learned” talk show; 3) Ninety-minute Nonfiction Specials with thirty-minute call-in talk show/discussion, location and studio based. These specials are intended to inform or educate the general public or specific audiences on current events or issues where the intended audience may be suspicious or apprehensive of the subject matter and/or its application in their lives.  These programs generally originate from a studio setting and include live interaction with a studio audience or live call-in questions; 4) Thirty-minute Call-in Talk Show, studio based. These specials are intended to inform or educate the general public or specific audiences on current events or issues where the intended audience may be suspicious or apprehensive of the subject matter and/or its application in their lives.  These programs generally originate from a studio setting and include live interaction with a studio audience or live call-in questions; 5) Thirty-minute TV News Program comprised of nonfiction reporter packages relevant and timely in nature, reporting on the current health related news and information from the public and private industry. This program style will have on-camera journalist(s) as anchors, studio and location based; 6) Thirty to Sixty-minute TV Magazine style nonfiction program, with on-camera host(s) or journalist(s), studio and location based; 7) Daily Health Updates– 1.5 to 3 minute packages relevant and timely in nature, reporting on the current health related news and information; and 8) Information “Shorts” – 1.5 to 3 minute packages relevant and timely in nature, reporting on the current health related news and information based on pandemic planning or emergency preparedness.  The primary objective for the production company is to support HHS by developing creative ideas and writing creative treatments and then implementing those ideas by producing programming that offers the most timely, trustworthy, accurate emergency preparedness and disaster relief programming to enable HHS to be a national source for health and wellness programming.  The capability statement should address the following capabilities for each deliverable (listed as numbers 1 through 8 above) they are responding to: 1) The contractor must demonstrate they possess all management and production staff necessary to produce the deliverable(s); 2) The contractor must demonstrate television production experience relevant to the deliverable(s) listed in terms of complexity, technical difficulty and delivery in a timely and cost effective manner; 3) The contractor must show past experience in productions addressing health issues and health related emergency preparedness, response and mitigation information; and  4) The contractor must demonstrate they possess all equipment necessary to produce the deliverable(s).  No solicitation exists, and any solicitation that could possibly result from this announcement will be synopsized and advertised. Interested contractors possessing the required capabilities to meet the above requirement should submit a cover letter citing the deliverable(s) by deliverable number that they are responding to and providing a capability statement not to exceed 10 pages demonstrating the ability to perform all aspects of all the deliverable(s) they are responding to. Responses must clearly indicate which deliverable(s) the information provided corresponds to and include the following: name and address of the firm, named central point of contact along with email address; DUNS number; any applicable commercial price list(s); size of business, including average annual revenues for the past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are a large, small, small-disadvantaged, 8(a) HUBZone, woman-owned, historically black college or university and/or minority service institute, number of years in business; affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners; list of customers covering the past five years; and additional documentation such as company literature and brochures. If this additional documentation supports the required capabilities it is incumbent to address this reference in the cover letter or other area of the capability statement and indicate specifically how it addresses the capabilities sought. Documentation provided must address all required elements listed herein; providing only a reference to a website is unacceptable for purposes of this announcement and will not be considered or reviewed. Capability statements with the cover letter and any supporting documentation must be submitted via email to pscacquisitions@psc.gov, to the attention of Jonathan Hamlet and referencing this announcement number. No hand-delivered or by-mail copies shall be accepted under any circumstances. Responses are due no later than 12:00 PM Eastern Time, May 18, 2006.

<DESC>This shall serve as the official Request for Expression of Interest (REI) to participate in a project to demonstrate and test a high performance data radio for Communication Based Train Control (CBTC) and to support interoperable communication among railroad business applications. 

The purpose of this REI is to solicit Data Radio suppliers who have products that may meet the requirements of the railroad industry and who are interested in having their products considered by the railroad industry as a data radio solution for CBTC and other railroad communication needs.  Responding to this REI does not ensure that the respondent’s products will be purchased or tested under this program.   Responding to this REI allows the respondent’s products to be considered as a possible data radio solution for the railroad industry.  

The US and Canadian railroad industry has approximately 20,000 locomotives, 5,000 radio base station locations, and 50,000 wayside equipment locations that could be possible candidates for application of the new HPDR.  Participation in this program by Data Radio Suppliers and providing a solution that meets the requirements developed in this program does not ensure that the product will be adopted by any railroad.  The HPDR project does not represent a railroad industry commitment to purchase.

Qualifications for Selection as a Participating Organization:
Organization(s) will be selected for participation based on their response to this Request for Expression of Interest, which must include as a minimum the following:
1.	Provide a positive response to this Request for Expression of Interest indicating a desire to participate in the Higher Performance Data Radio Project.  This response must also include as a minimum:

This assessment should include as a minimum the following sections:
i.	Overview – demonstrating an understanding of the objectives and scope of the project
ii.	Approach – presenting an outline of a feasible approach for meeting the project objectives and scope
iii.	Resources – describing the resource needs of the project including both those needed and those contributed by the participating organization.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN).  The following information is provided for planning purposes only and is subject to change.  This Request for Information (RFI) does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), invitation for bid (IFB), or an announcement of a solicitation. No cost data should be submitted.  The Government is not committed or obligated to pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI, and no basis for claim shall arise as a result of this RFI or any contractor response to this RFI.  The Department of Defense (DOD) Command, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SSC) San Diego is conducting market research and planning for the potential upgrade of the AN/URN-25 TACAN system.  The TACAN system consists of one or more AN/URN-25 TACAN Transponder Groups and either the OE- 273/URN Antenna Group for shipboard applications or the OE-258/URN Antenna Group for shore base applications.  The TACAN system provides TACAN equipped aircraft with range, bearing, and station identification within a 300 mile radius. 1.  NAVAIRSYSCOM issued Sources Sought Notice on 31 May 2005 for the potential upgrade/replacement of the AN/URN-25 Transponder Group portion of the TACAN under FSC Code 16.  The final determination from the RFI was to continue working to upgrade the existing system via Engineering Change Proposals (ECP) and to continue looking for possible replacement COTS/NDE equipment. 2. SSC San Diego, Code 2334, in conjunction with NAVAIR requirements, solicits industry comments on their approach to modernize the existing AN/URN-25 Transponder Group.  The approach must meet Military Specification MIL-STD-291C and FCC parts 15 and 87 compliant, and capable of successfully completing an FAA flight check.  The proposed solution must address if it will meet, or will be designed to comply with, MIL-E- 16400 (shock, vibration, power, humidity, salt fog, temperature, etc), MIL-STD-1605 (shipboard electromagnetic compatibility), and MIL- STD-461 (control of electromagnetic interference characteristics of subsystems and equipment). 3. The specific goal is to upgrade the fielded AN/URN-25 TACAN systems using Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) to the fullest extent possible. Specific components that must be reused are the Intermediate Power Amplifier, Power Amplifier, and High Voltage Power Supply assemblies.  The upgrade must be designed to be implemented on-site in existing TACAN systems. 4. This announcement invites comments from industry regarding capability to meet this requirement. The Government  requests that comments include information regarding the existence of GSA Schedule Contracts or other contractual vehicles that may be utilized to expedite this procurement. Request all written responses and comments be received no latter than 4:00 PM PST on 10 May 2006 to the POC e-mail address.  For information regarding this sources sought, contact the POC, Mr. John J. Berlin II, (619) 553-4501 or via e-mail at: john.berlin@navy.mil. Acknowledgement of receipt will not be made.  For future information about this announcement,, refer to the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, San Diego (SPAWAR), https://e- commerce.spawar.navy.mil.  Firms responding should indicate whether they are small business (S), small disadvantaged business (SDB), 8(a), or large business (L).  Interested parties should provide a primary point of contact, including telephone number and e-mailing address.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico Virginia, has a need for a Non-Developmental, expeditionary power sources to supplement the BA5590 lithium battery with alternatives that provides greater energy at a lower carrying weight. A Request For Information (RFI) was released on 9 February 2005 seeking small format, non-hazardous, Magnesium-Air-Water batteries.  The results of the RFI revealed that a domestic capability to meet the United States Marine Corps' needs using a non-developmental battery system does not exist.  However, the results of the Capability Assessment did indicate foreign battery systems could meet the requirements.  The Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico Virginia intends to procure approximately $100,000.00 worth of battery systems as part of a Foreign Comparative Test (FCT), with each of the following two companies: MAG Power Systems, Inc. Vancouver and B.C.  MEET Co., LTD (Korea).  This effort will procure systems to test in an operational environment from each vendor to enable a Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) to be conducted.

<SUBJECT>R -- Clarification of 1Feb 2006 Industry Day
<DESC>During the 1 February 2006, Industry Day briefing, the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) A4A6 Director identified several potential contract requirements that will need contractor suppor and provided the status of the UNI-Comm acquisition. 

The briefing also identified 21 CONS and the Air Force as having already awarded some Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts that may meet the identified needs.   In accordance with Air Force and AFSPC policy, if the new requirement fits the scope of any of the below identified contracts, then 21 CONS will follow the mandate and use the existing contracts to obtain the support rather than establish a new contract.  For reference purposes, please see the following contract descriptions of the existing Air Force and AFSPC contracts and acquisitions: 

CAASETA (Contract Advisory and Assistance, Scientific, Engineering, and Technical Assistance Services) – Consists of four IDIQ contracts that were awarded in Nov 2004 by 21 CONS to provide AFSPC with technical and analytical tools; support or improve policy development, management and administration and improve the operation of systems supporting the AFSPC Mission. The prime contractors are bd Systems, Booz Allen Hamilton, Scitor Inc, and SI International. The period of performance is Nov 2004 – 31 Oct 2009.  Task Orders awarded are either Cost-Plus-Fixed Fee or Firm-Fixed Price.  The program has $610 Million Ceiling. The small businesses contractors (bd Systems and Scitor) are guaranteed a minimum of 40% of the task order dollars.  POCs are as follows:  AFSPC/A7Z, Mr Russ Ogrinz  (719) 554-3589,  21 CONS/LGCCB, Ms LeAunna Ingram (719) 556-8351, AFSPC/A4A6XX, Mr Gene Boedigheimer, (719) 554-3319

C4I2TSR  (Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Information Technology, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Services) – The C4I2TSR contract was awarded by 21 CONS in Apr 2004 for the capability to engineer, integrate, furnish equipment and materials, install and test (EFI&T) and provide operations and maintenance, and allied support for a wide range of current and future C4I2TSR systems world-wide.  It is a single award IDIQ contract to SI International.  The period of performance is Apr 2004 – 30 Sep 2013 if all options are exercised and the ceiling is $800 million.  It is a 100% small business set-aside.  POCs are as follows:  21 CONS/LGCCA, Ms Tracie O’Donovan, (719) 556-8775; AFSPC/A6NX, Mr Dave Horaz, (719) 554-5175; AFSPC/A6NXC, Maj Gary Elliott, (719) 554-5054

NETCENTS – The Air Force awarded eight IDIQ contracts designed to support Standards enforcement, e-Commerce capability, technology refresh, purchase integrated solutions; COTS products; engineering services; life cycle management support.  The prime contract holders are The Centech Group, MultiMax, Northrop Grumman, NCI Information Systems, Booz Allen Hamilton, Telos Group, Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics. Four contracts are awarded to small businesses.  The period of performance is five years. Please refer to the NETCENTS  website for ordering procedures.  POCs are as follows: AFSPC/A4A6XX, Mr. Gene Boedigheimer, (719) 554-3319

UNI-Comm Status – Currently in the pre-acquisition stage.  The Uni-Comm program will establish and manage a single AFSPC command-wide communications and IT operations and maintenance contract for core services, providing same or improved level of service for the main operating bases (MOBs) in AFSPC.  This is because of the challenge faced by AFSPC.  Eight of the nine AFSPC Wings have contracted base communications services resulting in:  varying types of service; reduced flexibility in applying new tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) because of the many contractual stipulations that must be followed; non-standard performance criteria; and non-standard evaluation of performance. Additionally, the Uni-Comm program will support the single designated approval authority (DAA) concept, prepare for possible integration into the AFNETOPS and Integrated Network Operations and Security Center (I-NOSC) concept, and to the extent possible influence AF/DoD IT policy from our lessons learned. The Uni-Comm program will also provide a means of unity-of-command of the contracted communications and IT efforts in AFSPC in order to follow evaluate and assess compliance with AFSPC-led efforts.  Uni-Comm support will span all of the AFSPC Enterprise Network (AEN), including all Main Operating Bases (MOBs) and select GSUs.

The Uni-Comm Program continues to move forward. Uni-Comm has enjoyed much input from NAFs / Centers / Wings and continues to accept this input, including:

- February – April 2005: Site surveys: Included meetings with Wing Commanders who provided program comments and risks. These inputs were used to initiate Risk Assessment and Risk Mitigation Planning.
- May – July 2005: Senior Level Review Board: Over three meetings the team briefed the program scope, schedule and budget and received approval from Lt Gen Leaf, AFSPC/CV.
- September – November 2005: First Government review of the Statement of Work.
- November 2005 – January 2006: First Industry review of the Statement of Work. 
- January – March 2006: Second Government review of the Statement of Work. 
- March – May 2006: Request for Proposal data collection from the Wings. 

The Uni-Comm Program Management Office has announced its NETCENTS Recommendation

- 11 Jan 2006:  Met with AFPEO/CM, Mr Poussard. One of the topics was our evaluation of NETCENTS as a contract vehicle for this effort. Our evaluation came to the conclusion that NETCENTS did not provide adequately for the program requirements while mitigating sufficient risk. We proposed that either Small Business or Full-and-Open competition be used for this effort. 
- Mr Poussard agreed that that this was a viable way ahead. 
- 1 February 2006. During AFSPC/LC Industry Day, Lt Col Stanko briefed all contractors present that NETCENTS would not be the contracting vehicle used. 
- 50 CONS has published on FedBizOps the fact that NETCENTS contracting vehicle will not be used. All contractor companies are aware of our intent. 

The Uni-Comm Program Management Office is in the process of making a Small Business / Full-and-Open Competition recommendation

- Team is performing a rigorous Market Research evaluation to collect information from Small Business and make a recommendation on their capability to perform this work.
- The team has collected adequate information from Small Business to make this recommendation utilizing this two-month process. The decision is being coordinated through 50 CONS, Legal, and the Small Business Administration. 
- This recommendation will be heard by Mr Poussard during the Acquisition Strategy Panel in late April, a decision is expected at that time and when the decision is released to industry the contractors may perform proper proposal teaming. 

  POCs are as follows:  50 CONS/LGCZW, (719) 567-3831 and Ms. Kathryn Bernstein, Contract Specialist, (719) 567-3441; AFSPC/A6NJ, Lt Col Joseph Stanko, (719) 554-6012; AFSPC/A4A6XX, Mr Gene Boedigheimer, (719) 554-3319

The following paragraphs are excerpts from Air Force and AFSPC policy documents providing the guidance 21 CONS is required to follow for use of the existing contracts. 

The Air Force NETCENTS policy states the NETCENTS contract is the mandatory source for communication capabilities procured to satisfy Air Force Appropriated fund requirements for products and services associated with the design, engineering, integration, installation and configuration of the Air Force Networks and networked infrastructure.  

Since the C4I2TSR contract is a small business set-aside that supports the achievement of Air Force small business goals, it is exempt from the mandatory use policy of NETCENTS and all options can be exercised.  AFSPC has supplemented the Air Force NETCENTS policy stating:

The AF-CIO has mandated NETCENTS as the source for obtaining products and services associated with an integrated project that may include design, engineering, integration, installation and configuration of AFSPC networks and networked infrastructure.  However, the AFSPC Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Information Technology, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4I2TSR) contract is a small business set aside specifically designed for these contract categories and is the preferred AFSPC vehicle for these products/services.  AFSPC organizations shall consider the C4I2TSR contract first; if unable to use this vehicle, organizations are then mandated to use NETCENTS.

The AFSPC CAASETA policy is:

This contract will be the primary provider of all A&AS and E&TA support for HQ AFSPC.  By implementing the CAASETA contract, we will have a single point of contact for all A&AS and E&TA contracts which will help us more effectively use our resources in HQ AFSPC.  To ensure the success of this effort, we have established the CAASETA Program Management Office (PMO), HQ AFSPC/MSZ.  MSZ must be aware of all A&AS and E&TA efforts currently on contract and those being planned, including contracts with any remaining option years.   Effective immediately, no A&AS or E&TA contract actions or modifications will be executed in HQ AFSPC without coordination with the CAASETA PMO.  This includes, but is not limited to, putting efforts or funding on any task orders or contracts with General Services Administration (GSA) contracts, or on a Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) of another organization’s contract, or spending any HQ AFSPC TOA  or spending another organization’s or agency’s TOA.   Exemption from the CAASETA contract is by waiver only.  

As of 15 Mar 2006, only two firm requirements have been identified and provided to 21 CONS.  Both of these requirements will be awarded against the existing AFSPC IDIQ contracts.  Even though the existing contracts will be used, there still may be some subcontracting possibilities.  The above contract holder names are provided for reference so those companies not already affiliated with the any of these prime contractors may explore any possible subcontracting opportunities. 

Not all requirements have been fully developed or even identified, so the potential does still exist for additional contractor support.  For those efforts that do not fit any of those existing contracts, 21 CONS will work with AFSPC A4/A6 and A7 to determine an acquisition strategy at the appropriate time:  whether that is a GSA vehicle or some other type of acquisition, full and open, set-aside etc… as appropriate for the circumstances.

<SUBJECT>Q -- Managed Care Support Services - Request for Information
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The TRICARE Management Activity invites potential sources to provide an industry perspective to the TRICARE Program in order that the structure of the third generation of TRICARE Managed Care Support (MCS) contracts may be developed to reflect best practices and innovative solutions to the many military health care challenges.  Input and information may be provided in writing or through one-on-one meetings with the TRICARE Management Activity.  One-on-one meetings are intended to allow full disclosure in an environment that protects any information shared.  The one-on-one meetings will be held face-to-face at TRICARE Management Activity Office in Aurora, Colorado; and will occur between June 5, and June 16, 2006.  If you are interested in providing input into the future of the military health care system through the services provided under contracts for Managed Care Support, please contact Mr. Scott Lamond, Contracting Officer, via e-mail at scott.lamond@tma.osd.mil no later then May 19, 2006, to make arrangements for a one-on-one meeting.  If a face-to-face meeting is not possible, conference calls, or submission of written information will be considered.

Overview:  The Defense Health Program (DHP) consists of direct care provided by DoD personnel through Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) and clinics and purchased care provided through Managed Care Support Contractors. This overview is to describe the purchased care portion of the DHP.  Additional information is available on the TRICARE Management Activity World Wide Web site at www.tricare.osd.mil. In order to fulfill the purchased care needs of the DHP, sources/contractors must provide all services necessary to fully support DoD's primary wartime readiness mission while supplementing the services provided through DoD owned and/or operated health care facilities.  Information from sources/contractors should address providing clinical and administrative services that are comparable to the best offered in the civilian community and fulfilling the objectives complying with the scope and structure of TRICARE; i.e., benefits and beneficiary liabilities, including technical requirements specified under the TRICARE uniform health care benefit. Information must address the expertise of managed care organizations and health benefit administrators in incorporating and operating the best business model and practices of the private sector in support of DoD healthcare delivery. Any contractor selected for contract award will have to provide the DoD with clinical and administrative services that are comparable to the best offered in the civilian community. Information is sought to assure that the services will be delivered in a manner that achieves a fully integrated health care delivery and financing system for all Military Health System (MHS) beneficiaries.

Current Status of the Defense Health Program (DHP): The medical mission of the Department of Defense is to maintain readiness through health and medical services provided to the armed forces during military operations, and to provide health and medical services/support to the members of the armed forces, their family members and others entitled to DoD health care. The MHS must be prepared not only to provide a high quality, cost-effective health care benefit to its eligible members during peacetime, but also must be prepared to support the armed forces during exercises, contingencies, operations other than war, and in wartime.

In support of its readiness mission, the MHS maintains a system of MTFs and clinics, located in DoD “catchment areas,” that provide direct care to active duty personnel and to others who are eligible for military health benefits if space is available. Although the number and size of direct care facilities has declined in recent years, it remains important that MTFs are optimized in order to maintain the clinical skills of military clinical staff to support medical readiness. Currently, the direct care system cannot fully support the total demand for health care services; therefore, TRICARE uses the direct care system as the main delivery system, and through the awarding of MCS contracts, augments the direct care system through a civilian network of providers and facilities serving its eligible members.

MCS services apply to approximately 9.2 million active and retired members of the Uniformed Services: the U.S. Army, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Marine Corps, the U. S. Coast Guard, the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service and the Commissioned Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, their spouses and children and their surviving family members subject to the provisions of Chapter 55 of Title 10, U.S.C. Also eligible are Medal of Honor recipients (Chapter 55 of Title 10, U.S.C., Section 1074h.).

Currently, TRICARE provides three health care options for beneficiaries—Prime, Extra, and Standard.   TRICARE Prime is similar to an HMO with a Point of Service option and requires beneficiary enrollment. All Active Duty personnel are TRICARE Prime enrollees, although they are required to receive all of their care either in the MTF or under special rules that apply to Active Duty healthcare. Active Duty family members may elect to enroll and are not required to pay an annual enrollment fee or co-pays for care delivered in the network or the direct care system; however, other eligible beneficiaries pay an annual enrollment fee to enroll in TRICARE Prime. TRICARE Extra, which requires no enrollment, is an option in which the beneficiary may choose to use a provider in the contractor-developed network, with reduced cost-sharing for a particular episode of care, but is not restricted to use the network. TRICARE Standard is a fee-for-service option in which the beneficiary is free to use any authorized provider. The three options of TRICARE are described fully in 32 CFR Part 199.17 and 199.18 which may be accessed on the TRICARE Management Activity World Wide Web site at www.tricare.osd.mil.

Currently, TRICARE Prime enrollees receive all primary care from a Primary Care Manager (PCM), who may be located at the MTF or may be a civilian provider in the MCS provider network. The MCS contractor is responsible for providing MTF enrollees and Medicare dual-eligible beneficiaries with other services such as network referrals, population health, medical management, and beneficiary education. Therefore, a MCS contractor interface with MTF enrollees will largely occur in catchment areas, with workload driven by the MTF’s capability and capacity.  The MCS contractor is currently gains or loses profit based on the cost of (a cost plus incentive fee arrangement) all care and services provided to Prime enrollees (other than Active Duty members) having either MTF or civilian PCMs, and for all TRICARE Extra and TRICARE Standard care.  The Government encourages potential sources to comment on this arrangement understanding that provisions of law dictate that health care costs be underwritten by the Managed Care Contractor.  The MHS is organized into TRICARE Regions within the United States and around the world.  Currently, at a minimum, a MCS contractor is required to establish a TRICARE Prime network in each catchment area surrounding a MTF and in the area of Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) sites.

The Department of Defense (DoD) requires delivery of a uniform health care benefit in the form of uniform healthcare quality, structure and patient cost-sharing. However, DoD is also interested in taking advantage of the expertise of the civilian sector and incorporating best practices.

Proposed Contract Performance Objectives:  “A world-class health system that supports the military mission by fostering, protecting, sustaining and restoring health” is our vision for fulfilling the MHS’ mission “To enhance DoD and our Nation’s security by providing health support for the full range of military operations and sustaining the health of all those entrusted to our care.”  As noted above, this is accomplished through an integrated health care delivery system consisting of our military hospitals and clinics, as well as, services purchased in the civilian sector.  The TRICARE Program is accomplishing this mission today through Managed Care Support Contracts (MCSC) that contains the following “Contract Objectives.”  These Objectives are not listed by order of importance.

Objective 1 – In partnership with the Military Health System (MHS), optimize the delivery of health care services in the direct care system (see the definition of Military Treatment Facility Optimization in the TRICARE Operations Manual, Appendix A) for all MHS beneficiaries (active duty personnel, Military Treatment Facility (MTF) enrollees, civilian network enrollees, and non-enrollees).

Objective 2 - Beneficiary satisfaction at the highest level possible throughout the period of performance, through the delivery of world-class health care as well as customer friendly program services. Beneficiary must be highly satisfied with each and every service provided by the contractor during each and every contact.

Objective 3 - Attain “best value health care” (See TRICARE Operations Manual, Appendix A) services in support of the MHS mission utilizing commercial practices when practical.

Objective 4 - Fully operational services and systems at the start of health care delivery. Minimal disruption to beneficiaries and MTFs.

Objective 5 - Ready access to contractor maintained data to support the Department of Defense’s (DoD) financial planning, health systems planning, medical resource management, clinical management, clinical research, and contract administration activities.

These “Objectives” are not unchangeable.  Potential sources may have more contemporary information on the proper objectives for achieving our vision and mission while clearly focusing on measurable, high quality clinical and administrative services achieved in the most cost efficient manner for the American taxpayer.  We are also very interested in the industry’s thoughts concerning performance requirements. Requirements in this setting represent performance that must occur at or exceed specified performance standards and that achieves outcome based objectives identified in a contract.  Examples of the performance standards may be found in the TRICARE Operations Manual at www.tricare.mil.  TMA is very interested in the industry’s assessment of the existing performance standards and suggestions for new, revised, and or completely changed performance standards.  Performance standards information is desired for the following areas of interest that are being included in the contracts. 

  1.  Networks – Access to network providers, location of networks (networks are required around military hospitals and clinics and Base Realignment and Closure Sites (BRAC).  Offerors are allowed to propose networks where “cost-effective.”  What does industry suggest in relation to networks?
  2.  Referral Management – TRICARE Prime enrollees currently require a referral from their primary care manager prior to seeing another provider (there are some exceptions for preventive and mental health care).  In lieu of obtaining a referral, Prime enrollees may use the point-of-service option and pay a $300 individual deductible and 50% cost share.  Referral management is also currently used to direct patients to MTFs who have the “right of first refusal” for any care referred by a civilian provider.  What are current practices in an HMO environment and how have these practices impacted cost?

  3.  MTF Coordination – Close coordination between our MTFs and MCSCs is currently critical as networks and referral management must continuously adjust to support the changes in MTF capability and capacity that occur daily as the result of war, contingency operations, national disasters, deployments, training, transfers, etc.  TMA is interested in discussing the impact MTF operations have on contracts and the extent to which this impact affects costs, network management, and industry’s interest in submitting proposals on TRICARE contracts.

  4.  Medical Management.  We define medical management as contemporary practices in areas such as network management, utilization management, case management, care coordination, disease management, and the various additional terms and models for managing the clinical and social needs of the beneficiary to achieve the short and long term cost-effectiveness of the MHS while achieving the highest level of satisfaction among MHS beneficiaries.  What is the value of each of the named approaches and are there other opportunities to enhance the quality of care while ensuring the appropriate expenditure of tax dollars.

  5.  Claims Processing.  TRICARE anticipates processing 170 million claims across all contracts (managed care, pharmacy, TRICARE for Life, dental, etc.) next year.  How can TRICARE achieve efficiencies while complying with federal laws regarding the expenditure of Government dollars?

  6.  Customer Service.  TRICARE provides customer services via telephone, e-mail, web based materials, on-site service centers at all MTFs, and thousands of briefings annually.  How would a commercial concern approach customer service?  How is that level of service received by your commercial clients?  What percent of a premium is dedicated to customer service other than marketing?

  7.  Automated Data Processing.  TRICARE has a number of unique data processing requirements including Department of Defense mandated security procedures and certifications, interfaces with DEERS to determine eligibility on-line, processing enrollments through Government systems, and submitting payment records in support of claims processing activities.  Many of these requirements are not negotiable; however, we are interested in the impact of these requirements on costs and the level of interest in proposing on future contracts.

  8.  Management Services.  This is a broad category that includes staffing, quality management/quality improvement, reporting, responsiveness to change, and managing contractor operations to fulfill the Government’s performance standards while achieving the Government’s outcomes.  What should the Government require in terms of management services, how should they be measured, and how should the Government monitor performance?

  9.  Incentives.  What positive and negative incentives are used in the industry, if any, and how do they impact your operations and proposals. What incentives should be created that would help achieve the goals of TRICARE?

The Government is interested in any information potential sources would like to address in support of achieving high quality, cost effective delivery of health care services.  Please remember there are legislative limitations and recommendations conflicting with statutes may not be able to be implemented.  However, any of the administrative requirement changes which support a more efficient TRICARE Program may be acceptable for information presentation.  The Regulations, TRICARE Operations Manual, TRICARE Policy Manual, TRICARE Systems Manual, and TRICARE Reimbursement Manual are all requirements of the TRICARE Program and uniform benefit. These are available for review at www.tricare.mil and may provide insight to potential sources.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Retrofitting of Vehicles
<DESC>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Mt. Weather Emergency Operations Center (MWEOC), Mt. Weather (Bluemont), VA  intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with On Call Communications, Lake Forest, CA for the purchase of  equipment and services to retrofit Mobile Disaster Recovery Centers (MDRCs) and the Mobile Emergency Response System (MERS) with satellite equipment to provide voice and data communications in the field.  FEMA intends on issuing a purchase order to On Call Communications utilizing Simplified Acquisition/Commercial Items/Services procedures.  The vendor will be required to retrofit twelve MDRCs that were originally outfitted by a separate vendor.  FEMA requires that all of the MDRC’s operate on a common platform for compatibility purposes.  FEMA also requires small enhancements to the ten oldest MDRCs to bring them up to the standard of the later vehicles.  FEMA also requires upgrade of the MERS vehicles, many of which are operating with equipment purchased in the 1980s, so that the MERS communications will be compatible with the MDRC communications, and all FEMA mobile units will ultimately operate on the same platform.  It is imperative that the MDRCs and the MERS have compatible equipment.  FEMA’s response and recovery mission will be jeopardized if FEMA has multiple vendors, each supporting small numbers of vehicles.  The satellite equipment is at risk of failure if FEMA must procure equipment from a different vendor for different vehicles, and if equipment from one vehicle is not interchangeable with equipment from another vehicle.  On Call has performed previous retrofits under separate awards made during Fiscal Year 2004 and 2005 and this current project is a continuation of FEMA’s retrofit requirement in support of the response and recovery mission.  Responses shall be sent via email to Sandra.nixon@dhs.gov and must be received no later than 12:00 NOON/EST on May 12, 2006.  This is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all responses received by the date identified above will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This is a small business set-aside requirement, NAICS Code is 517310 , Small Business Size is 1500.

Proposals will be evaluated based on the factors described below.  Delivery & Past Performance are significantly more important than price.  This Award will be made on a Best Value basis.

The Government, at its discretion, may award this task without discussions.

Vendors shall identify and document all (if any) assumptions, conditions, or exceptions upon which the technical part of this proposal is based.  All assumptions (both technical and price) shall be included in the proposal.

A.  EVALUATION CRITERIA.  The Government will evaluate proposals based on the following factors.

 	Past Performance
  	Delivery       				

Assumptions, Conditions, and Exceptions will be reviewed for acceptability and potential impact on information provided in the task order proposal.

	1.  Delivery

	The Government is seeking to determine the speed of delivery.  This factor will be evaluated on the basis of the delivery proposal from the vendor. 

	2.  PAST PERFORMANCE

	If the vendor has no single experience that encompasses all types of past performance defined in the sub-factors below, the Offeror may show past performance through a combination of projects that together show that work has been accomplished that is consistent in scope and complexity with the objectives of this SOW.  The past performance information should include the vendor’s record of providing high quality services in a timely manner, standards of good workmanship, adhering to contract schedules, administrative aspects of contract performance, overall quality of assigned personnel, availability, stability, reasonable and cooperative behavior, commitment to and business-like concern for the interests of the customer, quality of overall program management approach, record of awards or performance recognition earned, and overall client satisfaction.

	Past performance that is technically relevant to this requirement will be of more value than non-relevant past performance.
	Vendors will be evaluated on examples of past performance wherein the experience of the vendor has contributed to the success of similar contracts/task orders.
	Vendors will be evaluated on examples of past performance wherein the infrastructure and resources of the vendor contributed to the success of similar contracts/task orders.
	A lack of relevant past performance data will be treated by the Government as a neutral evaluation.
	Past performance will be evaluated to determine contractor’s suitability for meeting the objectives of the SOW.
	Each proposal is required to describe a minimum of two but not more than five prior relevant projects that have been completed or are ongoing which are similar in scope and size to this SOW.   Include points of contact and their phone numbers, and titles, size of procurement in dollar value and e-mail addresses if possible.  Each reference shall include a contracting and technical point of contact.  
	Past performance is relevant to the support required for the task order.  Deliverables must meet contract requirements technical excellence, timing, budgeting and report accuracy.  Management must be effective with flexible and responsive staffing with no performance problems or deficiencies that impact task quality, time or cost.  Vendor must meet all requirements in overall satisfaction to end-users.

B.  PRICE PROPOSAL EVALUATION.  Vendors’ price proposal will be evaluated to determine price reasonableness.  Vendors’ technical and price proposals will be evaluated in determining best value to the Government.

MARKET RESEARCH REPORT 


Product or Service Needed:
In an effort to increase operational and test evaluation success in addition to aircrew confidence in missile warning and countermeasure defensive systems, a product capable of stimulating aircraft in flight, in the operational configuration is needed. This product must be an autonomous, man portable, ultraviolet emitter capable of stimulating the AAR-47, AAR-54, AAR-57, and AAR-, ultraviolet missile warning systems and the AAQ-24 directional infrared countermeasures (DIRCM) at distances in excess of 3km. 

Purpose of the Product or Service 
With “In theatre” operations becoming more frequent, it is vitally important that pilots and aircrew have the utmost confidence in the defensive systems that are protecting them, and that they are fully conversant with the indications and alarms they should expect if they were to be attacked by actual threats. This product will be used to emulate a MANPAD threat at distances in excess of 3km effectively testing the onboard missile warning systems and the hand-off to countermeasure defensive systems in the operational in flight configuration. 

1.	Performance Requirements 
This product must be capable of operating in manual and fully autonomous modes, capable of normal operation in all weather conditions and in the -30° through 55° C temperature range, range finding capability, fully reprogrammable with removable memory, eight hours of intermittent use via battery power and unlimited use with an external PSU with both 110/220v selection, man portable, and the capability to simulate multiple MANPAD threats effectively stimulating the AAR-47, AAR-54, AAR-57, AAR-60, ultraviolet missile warning systems and the AAQ-24 directional infrared countermeasures (DIRCM) at distances in excess of 3km. 

2.	Supplier Requirements 
System hardware, user’s manual, technical data, and system support software will be included in product delivery.

3.	Scheduling Requirements 
Products must be delivered six months from award of contract.

4.	Distribution Requirements 
N/A

5.	Geographic Issues
This product operates normally in all weather conditions and in the -30° through 55° C temperature range.


6.	Background Information: 
·	Evaluation of check-out procedures for missile warning systems on the ground has determined that system anomalies and deficiencies, not found by ground crews, may exist on the aircraft and become apparent to pilots and aircrews in flight. This exists primarily because the aircraft’s missile warning and countermeasure defensive systems are not stimulated in the operational in-flight configuration due to weight on wheels limitations and safety hazards that exist to equipment and personnel with flares loaded on the ground. With known deficiencies in ground checkout procedures, this has led to a decrease in aircrew confidence in their systems. This product will allow ground crews to stimulate missile warning systems in-flight, in operational configurations, giving a 100% confidence level that systems are operating normally or determining in-flight system discrepancies.

7.	Information Relative to Agency Requirements: 
·	Describe the essential physical and performance characteristics/functions required to meet the government’s needs. 
·	This product must be capable of operating in manual and fully autonomous modes, capable of normal operation in all weather conditions and in the -30° through 55° C temperature range, range finding capability, fully reprogrammable with removable memory, eight hours of intermittent use on battery power and unlimited use with an external PSU with both 110/220v selection, man portable, and the capability to simulate multiple MANPAD threats effectively stimulating the AAR-47, AAR-54, AAR-57, AAR-60, ultraviolet missile warning systems and the AAQ-24 directional infrared countermeasures (DIRCM) at distances in excess of 3km.   
·	The Mallina is an off the shelf commercial product utilized by multiple entities within the Department of Defense.
·	There is currently no available support equipment that can be modified to meet these requirements.
·	This product operates normally in all weather conditions and in the -30° through 55° C temperature range.
·	 Cross utilization on all platforms employing the systems listed above makes procurement cost effective. 
·	This support equipment facilitates full system capability evaluation while aircraft is in flight.
8.	Identification and Involvement of the Functional Disciplines in Performance of Market Research: 
·	Technical  participation by the 46th Test Wing at Eglin AFB and ECR at China Lake. 
·	46th Test Wing POC Jerry Cowing: COMM (850) 882-5448  DSN: 872-5448 and Russell Baudree: DSN: 872-5602.
·	China Lake POC Pam Tillery: COMM (760) 939-9140.

(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation, Notice of Intent.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Affymetrix, for Custom Gene Chips, in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Submit offers on NOI-RML-6023. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-09 dated 4/19/06. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541710 and the small business size is 500.  SCHEDULE:  The Rocky Mountain Laboratories, (RML), performs basic research contributing to the development of diagnostic reagents, therapeutics and vaccines against human bacterial pathogens. Construction of an Affymetrix microarray custom chip containing oligonucleotide sequences representing six bacterial pathogen genomes was performed towards achieving those goals. The RML has a need to purchase approximately 2(two) lots of custom chips from Affymetrix, lot size shall be approximately 90 (ninety) chips. This chip is unique and specific to RML.  No other chip of it’s kind exists. These gene chips are a one-time-use-only consumable and will be consumed in RML experiments.  This is an 40(forty) day, one time work effort, where the final product will be 2(two) Lots of RML custom gene chips, at ~45 chips per lot.  The design and manufacturing process of this custom gene chip is wholly patented and owned by Affymetrix.  The chip is high density,  at 106 per cm2 (USPNos. 5445934 and 5744305).  The custom GeneChip® was made by photolithography manufacturing technology (USPNos. 5424186, 5510270), developed solely by Affymetrix.  The multi-genome GeneChip® probe array must enable identification of 2-fold or greater levels of change in expression levels, and detection of as little as 1 mRNA transcript in a complex mixture of 100,000.  The GeneChip® probe array must contain multiple unique probes designed to be Perfect Match (PM), 25-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs, to represent each mRNA transcript (full length gene) tested, and multiple probes designed to be Mis-Match (MM), to enable calibration of non-specific hybridization data (USPNos.5527681). Additional control sequences (yeast and commensal) must also be available on the chip for hybridization control, and housekeeping gene analysis.  The probe selection strategy for the multi-genome custom GeneChip® probe array was based upon a probe design database (USPNos. 6188783) and was able to distinguish between highly homologous sequences and those of closely related gene families, strains, species and genus of bacteria. The multi-genome custom GeneChip® probe array is  housed in a fixed volume reaction chamber (USPNos. 5945334, 6140044) providing automated and consistent hybridization of samples to the array. We will process the chips on our Affymetrix system which contains: the Affymetrix GeneArray® Scanner, Fluidics Station, 640 Hybridization Oven, Micro Array Suite/Data Mining Tool (USPNos. 5871928, 6040138, 6197506), MicroDB, and software database. No other photolithography-based chip, apart from those purchased from Affymetrix  is compatible with the Affymetrix system in place within the Genomics Unit of the Research Technologies Section. FOB Point shall be Destination, Hamilton, MT.  Inside delivery shall be six (6) weeks after receipt of the order by Affymetrix.  Delivery location is Rocky Mountain Laboratories, 903 S. 4th Street, Hamilton, MT.  The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: (B)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation; 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items; FAR52.212-2 Evaluation Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items; FAR 52-212.5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders Commercial Items;  By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall have posted their FAR 52.212-3 Offerors Representations and Certifications Commercial Items at website http://orca.bpn.gov.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.   THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.  

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-09.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. 

This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small business.  Pursuant to the non-manufacturer rule, the manufacturer and distributor of this equipment must be a small business in accordance with the NAICS code identified above.  For size purposes, there can be only one manufacturer of the end item being acquired. The manufacturer is the concern which, with its own facilities, performs the primary activities in transforming inorganic or organic substances, including the assembly of parts and components, into the end item being acquired.  The end item must possess characteristics which, as a result of mechanical, chemical or human action, it did not possess before the original substances, parts or components were assembled or transformed. The end item may be finished and ready for utilization or consumption, or it may be semifinished as a raw material to be used in further manufacturing. Firms which perform only minimal operations upon the item being procured do not qualify as manufacturers of the end item. 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Polymers Division, is developing metrology tools to probe the mechanics and failure of complex interfaces. These metrologies will probe the interface between polymers and metals, ceramics, and biomaterials.  

One metrology focuses on failure induced by biaxial stress generated when a bi-material is quenched from room temperature to cryogenic temperatures. Thus, a cryogenic system capable of ramping down to cryogenic temperatures is needed. The system must also be able to image the failure during this cooling step.

The cryogenic system to be provided, must include temperature controllers, mass flow controllers, and a liquid nitrogen dewar.  The measurement platform must be equipped with a fully integrated imaging system to detect failure as a function of spatial position across the sample.  The software package must include a graphics user interface (GUI) for programming thermal cycling and quenching, image analysis routines and data handling and storage schemes.

STATEMENT OF WORK General Objectives and Requirements Title of Project FY 2006 Compliance and Business Integrity (CBI) Annual Report A.  General Objectives and Requirements 1.  Background The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), administers the largest integrated health care system in the nation.  In 1999 VHA established the Office of Compliance and Business Integrity (CBI) and modeled it after the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) Compliance Program Guidance for Hospitals of 1998.  The purpose of the CBI Office is to serve as the principal adviser to the Office of the Under Secretary for Health in matters relating to compliance and organizational integrity in the business arena. In 2004, the HHS OIG supplemented its original guidance.  The new guidance confirmed that hospital compliance programs should periodically review the effectiveness of their programs.  The CBI Office was, and is, developing methodologies to be used in this evaluative effort.  One major aspect of that effort is the CBI Annual Report. The CBI Annual Report is a survey-style questionnaire administered by the VHA Central CBI Office which inventories the program activities taking place at the facility level, sets policy in terms of required program elements to be in place at all medical centers, and serves as an educational tool as it references the source documentation for many elements. 2.  Overview The VHA CBI serves in an oversight capacity reviewing the VHA Chief Business Office (CBO) revenue program and ensures that appropriate internal and external controls are in place to adequately assure the Under Secretary that VHA is compliant in its business dealings with external parties, to include veterans, through the issuance of co-payments, and to third party payors such as private insurance companies. The CBI Program in VHA is organized as follows: Central Office in Washington has a Chief CBI Officer and ten to twelve analysts. Each VISN has one VISN CBI Officer. Each medical center has one CBI Officer. Some facilities and VISNs have support personnel, but that is not the norm. Each level has a "dotted line" reporting relationship to the CBI office above and below in the organization, but the officers directly report to the various medical center and VISN directors. 3.  Period of Performance The period of performance for this contract shall begin at the date of award and last eight (8) weeks; the period of performance may be concluded prior to that date.  The contract will end upon the government's official acceptance of the Fiscal Year 2006 CBI Annual Report.  The contractor shall begin work within 5 working days after contract award or as soon thereafter as is mutually agreed upon. 4. Place of Performance The government anticipates that this contract work will take place in the contractor's facility. 5. Contract Type This will be a Firm-Fixed Price contract. 6.  Scope and Objectives This Annual Report will be the third of its type conducted by the CBI Office.   The CBI Annual Report was established to meet several major objectives in the compliance and business integrity effort: To provide a standardized and consistent report, in both format and substance, to facilitate annual reports by VA medical center and VISN CBIO as required by the CBI Program. To provide VHA leadership at the VA medical center, VISN, and VA Central Office levels with information regarding the state of facility compliance programs on an annual basis. To provide standard and consistent information to the Compliance Advisory Board (CAB) and the CAB Certification Subcommittee for their use in reporting to the Executive Committee of National Leadership Board (NLB). To provide a standardized database of CBI program elements to facilitate the evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness of CBI programs, and assessment of those program elements that make the most difference in compliance outcomes. To promote excellence in the compliance arena by highlighting best practices, supporting program effectiveness, and providing a vehicle for marketing effective compliance strategies in VHA. The Annual Report is used to inventory facility-based CBI program initiatives throughout a fiscal year.  It is a survey style instrument which asks yes/no questions, provides an opportunity to comment on each question to clarify an answer, and requests that evidence of the CBI program structure and activities be attached in the form of policies, procedures and plans. Although it is survey-style in how it collects data, the Annual Report is not a survey.  Rather than an attempt to gather opinions or basic data, the report looks to collect fact-based verifiable data from facilities about their actions in the business compliance arena. In some ways, however, the Annual Report is similar to a survey.  The data received must be wholly accurate so that CBI Central Office may implement strategies to fill gaps in the program and recommend other actions, as appropriate, to the Under Secretary for Health.  It is therefore of paramount importance that the questions asked in the Annual Report tool are absolutely clear in what they are asking. Performance of this contract will require extensive knowledge of the healthcare compliance arena; healthcare billing practices and industry standards applicable to those practices; and knowledge of VHA's CBI program.  Because of scheduling issues, there will not be adequate resources or time available to train contracted staff extensively in these areas.  Because of this, the contractor must adequately document, in its proposal, expert knowledge of healthcare compliance, VHA and the VHA CBI program.  This knowledge can be demonstrated by prior exposure to healthcare compliance and VHA's CBI Program through conferences, educational sessions, prior work in the field, or a variety of other methods. B.  Tasks and Associated Deliverables This project consists of three major tasks, with associated deliverables: a) Development of a Work Plan for project implementation, b) Development of a First Draft FY 2006 CBI Annual Report, and c) Focus Group Administration and Analysis and Finalization of the FY 2006 CBI Annual Report. Task 1:  Development of a Work Plan for project implementation The contractor will develop and submit a project plan.  This plan will include resource allocation, timelines for completion of each task and completion of each deliverable. Task 1 Deliverable: Contract Schedule and Work Plan Government Acceptance/Rejection of Task 1 Deliverable: Upon receiving the Work Plan from the contractor, the government will have three (3) working days to approve, or request changes to, the Plan. Task 2:  Development of First Draft FY 2006 CBI Annual Report Enhancement of FY 2006 CBI Annual Report:  A draft FY 2006 CBI Annual Report has been developed by VHA CBI staff (Attachment 1) to assist potential contractors in developing bids.  CBI, in collaboration with other VHA stakeholders has determined the basic content of the report, seeking to inventory facility-level CBI program initiatives undertaken in FY 2006.  The CBI Annual Report will have all closed ended questions.  Closed ended questions can be distinguished as those questions that have a definitive (yes/no, a/b/c/d or date/dollar amount) answer. The contractor will enhance both reliability and validity in the report through the employment of psychometrics, expertise in healthcare compliance (specifically in the area of program effectiveness and measurement), and working knowledge of the VHA CBI Program, to recommend changes to the FY2006 Annual Report. Task 2 Deliverable:  First Draft FY 2006 CBI Annual Report Government Acceptance/Rejection of Task 2 Deliverable:  Upon receiving the First Draft FY 2006 CBI Annual Report from the contractor, the government will have three (3) working days to approve, or request changes to, the Draft. Task 3:  Finalization of the FY 2006 CBI Annual Report 3.1 Focus Group Analysis of Survey Instrument:  The Draft developed in Task 2 above will be discussed in a focus group of field CBI Officers administered by the contractor.  This small group should be large enough to test the reliability of the questions in the report. The population for the survey shall include 138 medical centers or health systems across the nation. Task 3.1 Deliverable: Written Summary Report of Focus Group Analysis Government Acceptance/Rejection of Task 3.1 Deliverable:  Upon receiving the Summary Report of Focus Group Analysis from the contractor, the government will have one (1) working day to approve, or request changes to, the Summary. 3.2 Survey Finalization:  Results of the Focus Group Analysis of the draft CBI Annual Report will be used to review, update, and make changes to the Report, prior to actual full survey data collection.  The key deliverable of Task 3 is the Final FY 2006 CBI Annual Report. Task 3.2 (Final) Deliverable:  Final FY 2006 CBI Annual Report Government Acceptance/Rejection of Task 3.2 Deliverable:  Upon receiving the Final FY 2006 CBI Annual Report from the contractor, the government will have five (5) working days to approve, or request changes to, the Report.

Questions received by the April 26th deadline have been answered below.

1.  In the synopsis, there seem to be a discrepancy between the period of performance for the base year (June 1, 2006 through May 31, 2007) and the corresponding line items CLIN0001 (June to August) and CLIN0002 (August to December)- please clarify. Answer for 1: Contracts are awarded on a yearly basis.  The contractor is expected to work for the entire year on the internship program.  The CLINs are task orders to fulfill Fall, Spring and Summer Internships.  The Summer internships ends in August and the Fall internship program begins in August.

2.  In regards to RAPIDGate Program, what are the required fees to participate in the program?  Answer for 2: RAPIDGate is no longer applicable to this solicitation or contract.  

3.	Since USCG has not clearly identified the pricing requirements, and in order to level the playing field, could you please provide specific pricing requirements? 

Answer for 3: Please supply information on cost per student according to requirements on the (performance work statement) PWS .  Examples from the PWS for pricing determinations include:  screening & placement of students across the 50 states as well as the U.S. Territories; payment of stipends; a Washington DC based orientation session for interns; student transportation costs; stipends for students; program; housing coordination; security fees for Rapid Gate.  Other pricing examples from the PWS include: administrative responsibilities of the contractor e.g., kickoff meeting, project planning, progress reports, progress meetings, general report requirements; database support services; training & orientation support services, student personnel services; and database administration. Please note, that these are just a few of the requirements that are required from the PWS, but all requirements on the PWS must be met. Please know that the requirements to PWS are found beginning in section 5.0.

4.	What are you looking for in the pricing part of the proposal as you have given no direction as to what or how you would like this priced.  All that is mentioned is that there will be task orders to be bid upon after award.  Perhaps, USCG can, for evaluation purposes, issue “plug” numbers for these services?  For example, we cannot price orientation because we don’t know from how far and where the interns will be arriving or we cannot price housing until we know the locations and number of interns going to those locations.

This is intended as an example only.  The Coast Guard expects the proposer to determine what is included in the stipend.

7.	If we are expected to pay the interns for their work performed for USCG, please give specific pay rates for these interns.  This will allow for an appropriate evaluation of proposals. Answer for 7: We expect to have undergraduate and graduate students as interns. Graduate students should earn a little more than undergraduate.   

8. Is there an incumbent? Answer for 8: There is no incumbent.

9. Was there a program such as this last year?

For stipend definition, please see answer #6.

11. What type of format will be accepted? Answer for 11:  Information is provided in the end of the description part of the Combined Solicitation/Synopsis.  Refer as well to Amendment 1 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors.

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships.

Does a contractor's participation in this project preclude that contractor from competing on future solicitations that are aimed at implementation of the methodologies developed on the current project?  A.  No. Q8.  In the description of Task Two the Solicitation states, "The contractor shall work with C&P staff to define and then finalize activity pick-lists for the application to ensure that valid work rate standards are generated."  What application does this sentence refer to?  Will the Government provide a description of this application and its functionalities?  A.  Any alternative methodologies would have to account for the activity pick lists and accommodate them in any proposed new application.  For analyze of alternatives, need know what activities are being measured and the general number (30+). Page 3 of 3 Q9.  In the description of Task Two the Solicitation states that the "current RO environment" comprises "ROs, Pension Maintenance Centers, Appeal Management Centers, Resource Centers, and Benefits Delivery at Discharge Centers" at 58 locations.  a. Do all of these entities report their data into the same information systems?  If not, how many systems are used to keep a record of information necessary to determine task durations?  A.  Yes b. Do all of these entities use the same coding and reporting conventions and data formats?  If not, how many different conventions / coding standards / formats are there?  A.  All the same. c. Does the Government have standards of data quality that are maintained across these sites?  Is the data from all locations of consistent quality and completeness?  A.  Yes Q10.  Past work measurement projects have begun with developing a measurement methodology and an activity pick list, and have subsequently included incorporating the pick list into an automated application, testing the application, supporting installation and data collection, and analyzing the data and reporting work measurement results. Do you expect these follow-on activities to occur? If so, would the successful offeror be precluded from bidding on and performing these follow-on activities due to a conflict of interest? A.  No would not be precluded. End of Amendment No.001
