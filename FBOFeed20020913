<SUBJECT>A--Broad Agency Announcement for Small Unit Air Vehicle (SUAV) Propulsion Systems
<SOLNBR>DAAH1002R0007
<RESPDATE>102902
<ARCHDATE>12282002
<CONTACT>Laurie Pierce, 757 878-3306
<DESC>NA The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate, in support of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), is soliciting technical and cost proposals for the development and demonstration of turbines, diesels, and hybrid diesel electric propulsion s ystems for Small Unit Air Vehicle (SUAV) systems. SUAVs include Organic Air Vehicle (OAV) and Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) Systems.  For purposes of this solicitation, SUAVs are defined as low-cost, small, robust, autonomous, ducted fan air vehicle systems capa ble of vertical takeoff, hover, transition to high speed cruise flight, and vertical landing.  Proposals are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein.  This Broad Agency Announcement constitutes the total solicitation.  T here will be no formal Request for Proposals (RFP) or other solicitation requests for this requirement other than this announcement.  Multiple awards during first quarter FY 03 are anticipated and awards may be staggered.  PROGRAM OBJECTIVE  The objective of the program is to develop and demonstrate the following two (2) propulsion systems:  SYSTEM ONE is an approximately 2.3 hp hybrid electric propulsion system, based on a 1.3 hp diesel engine in combination with a 1.0 hp electric motor.  SYSTEM TWO is a t urbine engine of less than 15 hp to drive the propulsion fan.  PROGRAM SCOPE/ANTICIPATED FUNDING LEVEL AND PERFORMANCE PERIOD:  Proposed solutions shall consider the complete propulsion system, including remote start capability and Thermal Electric Generat ors (TEG) and include a Base Program and Option as follows:  Base Program – anticipated period of performance is estimated to be nine months; anticipated funding is estimated to be $300-$400K.  We anticipate the scope/objective of the base effort to includ e design and development of the proposed system and a feasibility demonstration of the proposed technology.  Demonstration at laboratory scale (or full scale if hardware is available) to validate the critical technologies for the proposed system is anticip ated.  Option - the anticipated period of performance is estimated to be twelve months.  We anticipate the scope/objective of the Option effort to include optimization of the Base Program system design; fabrication (two sets of hardware for each System pro posed) and system test to validate and verify design and performance goals.  Hardware shall include the complete propulsion system, including remote start capability and electric generators.  Testing at Contractor's facility to demonstrate the system's abi lity to meet the proposed performance is anticipated.  The maximum available Government contribution for this program is not projected to exceed $2.5M and funds are not presently available.  The Government's obligation for any award resulting from this ann ouncement is contingent upon the availability of FY 03 funds.  TYPE OF FUNDING INSTRUMENT:  A variety of funding instruments are available pursuant to this announcement depending upon the proposed effort, the entity submitting the successful proposal(s), a nd statutory and regulatory requirements the Government must satisfy.  Such instruments include conventional contracts subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, as supplemented, and other transaction agreements for prototype projects subject to 10 U.S .C. 2371 and Section 845 of the 1994 National Defense Authorization Act, as amended.  Contract type is a subject for negotiation.  Any proposal for an agreement shall describe the approach to meeting the provisions of Section 803 of the National Defense Au thorization Act (for further information, go to the following link:  http://www.aatd.eustis.army.mil/Business/Divisions/Contracting/Docs/803.doc).  Offerors should consider benefits accruing as a result of the use of the agreement authority in lieu of a co ntract.  Such benefits may include such things as contractor team relationships formed that would not have been formed under a traditional contract, cost saving s or cost avoidance, potential commercial applications of technology developed under the program, etc.  For further information on other transactions, go to the following link:  http://www.aatd.eustis.army.mil/Business/Divisions/Contracting/Docs/Introducti on. doc.  PROPOSAL SELECTION CRITERIA/EVALUATION METHOD:  Multiple awards are anticipated and the Government reserves the right to select for award, any, all, part or none of the effort proposed (i.e., certain tasks versus total program).  Award will be based on a scientific and/or engineering evaluation of proposals (both technical and cost as it relates to technical effort) in accordance with the criteria below.  Proposals will be evaluated on their own merit without regard to other proposals submitted under this announcement.  Each proposal will receive a narrative rating and that rating will be used to develop an order of merit listing for each proposal.  Proposed cost will be evaluated for reasonableness and realism as appropriate.  Proposals will be evalua ted inclusive of the Option and in accordance with the five evaluation criteria stated below.  The Government reserves the right to exercise the Option at any time after award, subject to the availability of funds and based on the results of the Phase I, B ase effort.  Evaluation criteria are stated below with the following order of importance:  (1) is most important followed by (2) and (3) which are relatively equal; (4) and (5), which are relatively equal, are least important.  (1) Overall scientific merit  in relationship to the soundness and innovativeness of the technical approach.  (2) Offeror’s ability to implement the proposed program as demonstrated by availability of qualified personnel, equipment and facilities, and expertise relevant to the propose d propulsion technologies.  (3) Potential utility, effectiveness, and exit level of maturity of the proposed technology for SUAVs.  (4) The offeror’s commitment to transfer the technology to the Government and the degree to which technical data and/or comp uter software developed under the proposed effort are to be delivered to the Government with unlimited/unrestricted rights.  (5) Cost:  Disclosure of Proposal Content. Offerors are advised that employees of support contractors may be called upon as subject  matter experts in the source selection process.  These individuals will be required to sign non-disclosure statements and will be authorized access to only those portions of the proposal data and discussions that are necessary to enable them to perform th eir respective duties.  Such firms are expressly prohibited from competing on the subject acquisition and from proposal scoring, ranking or recommending the selection of a source.  By submission of a proposal, the team agrees that proposal information may be disclosed to these selected individuals for the limited purpose stated above.  Any information not intended for limited release to these individuals must be clearly marked and submitted segregated from other proposal material with accompanying rationale  and identification of specific companies and/or individuals to be excluded.  The Government reserves the right to exclude from consideration any information that is not available to the entire source selection team.  INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION AND SUBMI TTAL OF PROPOSALS:  Offerors may submit a proposal for either System One, System Two or both Systems.

To ensure consistency throughout proposals, the following terms are defined: Cru ise Power: power setting which yields the best SFC @ SL SD.  Engine Failure: the inability to maintain 90% rated power.  Engine Life: the number of mission cycles that can be accomplished before engine failure.  Design life shall be specified at the popula tion’s 10% failure rate.  Inability to produce 90% rated power will constitute engine failure.  Engine Non-Starts: the percentage of engines that are non-starters. (i.e. power plant is not started by remote control in SD conditions with 45 seconds of start er engagement.)  Engine Specific Fuel Consumption: the fuel usage of the engine when operating at a MCP, specified in units of lbm/HP-hr.  Engine Start: the process of transitioning the engine from a state of no movement at ambient temperature to running u nder its own power, including spinning, and/or turning the engine over (heating is excluded).  Engine Weight: the weight of all the components necessary for a starting and self-sustaining engine, capable of maintaining demonstrated horsepower, ready for in stallation into an airframe, not including prop, and ground support equipment.  Fuel Efficiency: the efficiency of the engine as represented by specific fuel consumption (lbm/hp_hr).  Generator Efficiency: the ratio of generator electrical output to mechan ical power input at a specified speed.  Generator Power: the maximum continuous electrical output of the generator, rated at the speed corresponding to the engine’s maximum continuous power rating.  Maximum Continuous Power (MCP): maximum power that can be  sustained for one hour or more, at SL SD.  Measured Horsepower: uninstalled sustainable horsepower at the drive shaft as measured on a suitable test bench (e.g. dynamometer).  Mission Cycle: is comprised of an engine start, run for 60 minutes at maximum c ontinuous power without engine failure, engine stop, and cooling to ambient temperature.  Motor Power: the maximum continuous power rating of the propulsion motor at the system voltage.  Non-starters: those engines where engine start takes longer than 45 s econds, once the engine starter has been engaged.  Power System Efficiency: electrical output power vs. fuel usage of at a given output power rating.  Power to Weight Ratio: the ratio of measured maximum continuous horsepower to engine weight.  Rated Power : maximum power that can be sustained for 5 minutes at Sea Level (SL) Standard Day (SD) conditions.  Thrust-to-Weight Ratio: the ratio of total measured thrust available for flight propulsion from the engine and the electric motor, to the weight of the fli ght ready power pack.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) William J. Hughes Technical Center is currently undergoing a realignment of its strategy and structure to develop new capabilities for competitive success.  Critical to this realignment is the development and use of new approaches to measuring value and predicting future performance.  The Balanced Scorecard represents a key element in achieving this goal.  The Strategic Leadership Team (SLT) is responsible for the William J. Hughes Technical Center's overall performance measurement strategy.  The Office of Enterprise Performance (ACF) serves as the principal element within the Technical Center responsible for performance planning and monitoring of the Center's operations.  As the Office responsible for performance planning and measuring of the Center's operations, ACF has responsibility for the design, development, and implementation of the Balanced Scorecard Program for the William J. Hughes Technical Center. <P> The SLT has adopted Dr.R David Norton and Professor Robert Kaplan's Balanced Scorecard methodology for implementing performance policy, planning, and measurement consistent with the requirementsas required by of the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993.   <P> According to GAO-01-834 DOT's Status in Achieving Key Outcomes, annual performance plans as specified by the GPRA, are to clearly inform the Congress and the public of: the annual performance goals for agencies' major programs and activities, the measures that will be used to gauge performance, the strategies and resources required to achieve the performance goals, and the procedures that will be used to verify and validate performance information.  These annual plans, issued soon after transmittal of the president's budget, provide a direct linkage between an agency's longer-term goals and mission and day-to-day activities.  Annual performance reports are to subsequently report on the degree to which performance goals were met. <P> Dr. David Norton, President of the Balanced Scorecard Collaborative, developed the Balanced Scorecard methodology along with Professor Robert Kaplan, Chairman of the Board.  The "Balanced Scorecard Collaborative, Inc. (BSCol) and is the only training and facilitation organization in the world authorized for the Balanced Scorecard methodology as defined by Drs. Norton and Kaplan, as creators of the concept.  The Balanced Scorecard Collaborative, Inc. was selected because the Balanced Scorecard methodology provides an enterprise view of an organization's overall performance by integrating financial measures with other key performance measures.  Also, the WJHTC has utilized the Balanced Scorecard Collaborative, Inc. in the facilitation, training, and support of the corporate-level Balanced Scorecard.  Therefore, the Balanced Scorecard Collaborative is knowledgeable about the WJHTC current business practices and processes.  In order to meet the aggressive schedule and keep the m! omentum going, the Balanced Scorecard Collaborative, Inc. is the best choice to cascade the Balanced Scorecard down through other ACT business units.  There would be great risk of failure for the WJHTC Balanced Scorecard program if this momentum is lost.  The Balanced Scorecard Collaborative, Inc. has a lot of experience in training the WJHTC employees on the Balanced Scorecard methodology due to their involvement to date in developing the WJHTC corporate Balanced Scorecard. In addition, they have gained other FAA experience and knowledge during their development of the EnRoute scorecard.  For the above reasons, it is imperative that the Balanced Scorecard Collaborative, Inc. continue developing, training, and in the future cascade and performing assessments of the WJHTC Balanced Scorecard for a successful completion of this highly important and strategic program.     It is the intent of the FAA to award a contract to Balance Scorecard Collaborative under the authority of Fe! deral Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (AMS) 3.2.2.4 - Single Source Selection Procurement Process, Subpart 3.2.2.4.1.2, non-emergencies. <P> Interested parties who can meet the requirements called for in this announcement should respond by September 18, 2002 with their documentation in writing to: <P> FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center, Lisa Ferrante, ACX-52, Atlantic City Int'l Airport, NJ 08405, Fax number (609) 485-6766.  The FAA shall not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to the request for information, nor reimburse or otherwise pay any costs incurred by any party responding to this announcement. <P>

<DESC>Request for Proposals Notice for the Edward Zorinsky Federal Building Renovation, Omaha, Nebraska, Job PCN: INE99004.  Request for Technical Proposals o/a 10-01-02.   Request for Price Proposal o/a 02-18-03.  Estimated cost range:  $20,000,000 to $30,000,000.  Time for completion: 420 calendar days.  Summary of project:  The purpose of this source selection is to select a highly qualified construction contractor to provide renovation construction services on an existing Federal Office Building.  The Federal Office Building will be 430,000 gross square foot building located in Omaha, Nebraska and consists of nine (9) stories above grade, a basement, and partial sub-basement below grade plus a mechanical penthouse and small elevator penthouse at the top of the building.  This portion of the renovation will be a ?shell? construction contract which will include site/landscaping work, exterior demolition, exterior construction, some existing structural modifications, shell mechanical, electrical and plumbing, plus interior layout and finish work. Tenant fit out work will be procured under separate contract by GSA.  In compliance with Executive Order 12770, the building is designed and will be constructed entirely with metric dimensions.  There may be minimal asbestos removal.  The bidder, or subcontractor used by the bidder, shall meet the competency qualification requirements for asbestos removal as specified in Section 00120 of the specification.  Any contractor or subcontractor performing asbestos removal shall satisfy special responsibility and shall provide bodily injury liability insurance written on the comprehensive form of policy of at least $1,000,000 per occurrence.  Such coverage must encompass liabilities arising from work with hazardous materials involved.  Proposals will include a base bid, and options.

This is a competitive negotiated acquisition.  Proposals will be evaluated using a Two-Phase process. Phase I will be technical evaluations; Phase II will be for pricing. The Government intends to use the ?greatest value concept? in selecting the prime contractor.  The ?greatest value concept? is a method of evaluating price and other related factors specified in the solicitation; with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the greatest value to the Government in terms of performance and other factors. The objective is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, not necessarily to select the lowest price.  

Phase I, the Request for Technical Proposal (RFTP), contains a general scope of work, the Solicitation Provisions, the Proposal Submittal Requirements and the Evaluation Factors.  This RFTP will be issued on or about 09-13-02. All requests for the RFTP must be in writing.  Contact Joe York at 816-823-4915 or fax 816-926-3571.   There will be a Pre-Proposal Conference on or about 
10-16-02.  Proposals shall be received on or about 12-05-02 at the GSA, Office of Business & Support Services (6ADB), Federal Building, 1500 East Bannister Road, Room 1161, Kansas City, MO 64131-3088..  Specific date and time shall be specified in the RFTP.  All submittals must clearly indicate the solicitation number on the face of the envelope for identification purposes.  Late submittals will be handled in accordance with FAR 52-215-1.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  There will be a short list of technically qualified contractors published in the FedBizOpps on or about 12-13-02.

Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal?s acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted. The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.

The Government will evaluate all proposals.  Two factors will be considered:  
(1) a technical evaluation factor, and (2) price.  The elements that make up the technical evaluation factor, in order of importance, are:  (1) Experience and Past Performance of the Firm (50%), (2) Qualifications of Key Personnel (35%), and (3) Management and Technical Approach (15%). The price factor is not as important as the technical evaluation factor.  As proposals become more equal in their technical merits, price becomes more important.  Joint venture arrangements will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependence of the members to provide a quality team.  The Government will evaluate Phase I submissions to establish those firms within the ?competitive range.? Only those firms within the competitive range will be invited by the Government to provide Phase II submissions, consisting of: (1) pricing, (2) Subcontracting Plan, and (3) special competency requirements as specified in the specifications.

Phase II, Specifications (Bidding Documents) and drawings will be available for review at plan rooms at no cost.  The documents may be purchased by full size,  half size, and CD (cost to be determined later).  Cost is non-refundable.  Bidders interested in obtaining the bidding documents will need to make financial arrangements directly with Lane Blueprinting, 1520 Main Street, Kansas City MO 64108, phone 816-221-2500.  The planholders list will be based on those requesting the documents. The bidding documents will be available on or about 8-30-02.   For further information contact Joe York at phone 816-823-4915, or fax 816-926-3571.  Technical questions should be directed to the Project Manager, Glen Essink at phone 816-823-4904.

Prior to award of the contract, the contractor, if not a small business, will be required to negotiate a small business subcontracting plan.  Contract award will be contingent upon negotiation of an acceptable subcontracting plan.  In accordance with Public Law 95-507, the contractor will be required to provide the maximum practical opportunities for Small Business concerns, Small Business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals to participate as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.  As part of its commitment to socioeconomic limitative of the Federal Government, the GSA has established for fiscal year 2002 subcontracting goals of: 40% for small business, 8% for small disadvantaged business, 5% for women-owned business, 2.5% for HUB Zone, and 5% for Veteran Owned (may include 3% Service Disabled Veteran Owned).  In support of the agency efforts, firms seeking consideration for this contract should provide maximum practicable subcontracting opportunities.  Offerors must also provide a brief written narrative of outreach efforts made to utilize these small businesses.   Phase Two offerors will be required to submit a subcontracting plan with their price proposals.  The proposed procurement listed herein is not set aside for small business. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP), Chemoprevention Agent Development Group (CADRG), is interested in evaluating inhibitors of carcinogenesis in vitro, in order to identify potential chemopreventive agents against cancer.  Such agents would  be further evaluated in appropriate animal efficacy or clinical settings.  The CADRG has established a clearly defined integrated plan for the evaluation of chemopreventive agents.  This plan delineates criteria for classifying information that currently exists on any chemopreventive agent and thus defines what additional information and investigations are required to qualify the agent's experimental use in intervention trials of human cancer.  The primary purpose of this RFP is to use in vitro methods to screen chemopreventive agents (see Methods in Cell Biology Vol 19(1):1-70, 1997).  The objective of these studies is to determine the efficacy of  chemopreventive agents in an array of in vitro model systems representing different cell substrates, those of human origin in particular.  The studies are designed to rank-order and  prioritize agents for further development.  Those interested in obtaining a copy of this RFP should send their e-mail address to Dorothy McMillan at dm308v@nih.gov and a copy of the RFP will be forwarded electronically.  AN AWARD WILL ONLY BE MADE TO A MASTER AGREEMENT HOLDER IN THE IN VITRO MASTER AGREEMENT POOL.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 54171.  Those who are not currently in the In Vitro Master Agreement Pool and who wish to be considered for inclusion should consult the Research Contracts Branch web site at Http://amb.nci.nih.gov under "Current Requests for Proposals" and refer to RFP/N01-CN-85093-40.  It is anticipated that the RFP will be available around the middle of April 2002.  Questions should be directed, via facsimile or e-mail, to Dorothy McMillan, Contract Specialist, Prevention and Control Contracts Section, Research Contracts Branch, National Cancer Institute,  Bethesda, MD 20892-7226.  Phone: (301) 435-3828; fax: (301) 402-8579; e-mail: dm308v@nih.gov.

<DESC>A?INTRODUCTION: The Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate, Advanced Guidance Division (AFRL/MNG) is interested in receiving technical and cost proposals for the development of a new target source chamber and optical relay for the Kinetic Kill Vehicle Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulator (KHILS) facilities vacuum cold chamber (KVACC) to better align the parameters and capabilities with AFRL requirements.  This acquisition is considered restricted to small business only (Small Business Set-aside) and only U.S. firms may submit offers as prime contractors.  Firms responding to this solicitation should provide their business status as defined in FAR clause 52.219-1 for NAICS Code 339111 (500 people).  Proposals submitted must be in accordance with this announcement and must be received no later then 1:00 PM central standard time 15 Oct 2002.  Address proposals to AFRL/MNK, Suite 337, 101 W. Eglin Blvd., Eglin AFB FL 32542-6810, Attn: Judie Jacobson.  Proposals submitted after the cut-off date specified herein shall be treated in accordance with FAR 52-215-1(c)(3), "Instructions to Offerors -- Competitive Acquisition".  Responders must reference the above solicitation number MNK-PRDA-02-0008 on the outside of the package or in the subject line of an e-mail submission.  Since this is a PRDA, there will be no formal request for proposal or other solicitation regarding this announcement. Offerors should be alert to any PRDA amendments that may be published.  B--REQUIREMENTS: (1) Technical Description:  The KHILS facility develops advanced HWIL test technologies and provides a realistic ground-test environment for quantifying the performance of precision-guided weapons.  The KVACC system consists of three modular chambers, with each chamber designed for a specific function and housing a unique sub-element of the HWIL simulation test hardware. The three chambers are the main optical chamber, the source chamber, and the sensor chamber.  The entire multi-chamber grouping is supported on a common optical table isolated from ground vibrations.  Gate valves separate the three chambers and offer the capability to work with the smaller antechambers more easily than having to cycle the larger main (optical) chamber.  A closed-cycle helium refrigerator provides cryogenic cooling of the chamber components.  The KVACC system provides a complete cryogenic optical system, a complex infrared target projection system, and a surrogate sensor subsystem that meets the required optical, radiometric, and environmental conditions for hardware-in-the-loop testing of infrared guidance systems requiring exo-atmospheric temperature and altitude conditions.  To simulate these conditions infrared resistor array scene projectors are used.  The original design for KVACC anticipated a scene projector with an image size roughly 80% larger on edge than currently available projector arrays allow for. The limited size of cryogenic projector arrays over the next 3-5 years limits the Field of View of the KVACC projection system and limits the capabilities of the KHILS facility.  An optical relay is required to map current projector arrays into the full image size of the existing KVACC optics.  A larger source chamber is required to house the relay optics, two resistor arrays mounted on translation and rotation stages and associated beamcombiner and neutral density filter, an optional point source blackbody with aperture wheel, and an optional extended blackbody source.  (2) Technical Goals:  The basic program will be for the design and development of the optical relay, new source chamber and associated component mounting surfaces, and any optical table extensions and isolators required to support the larger chamber. The basic system must also accommodate the optional subsystems. The basic program will be broken into two phases.  Phase I (3 months) will produce a detailed design with engineering specifications sufficient for manufacture of the source chamber , optical relay, and support structure.  Phase I will conclude with the detailed design presented at a Configuration Design Review (CDR) and contingent on government approval of the design.  Phase II (9 months) will include the manufacture, integration, installation and acceptance testing of the total system at the KHILS facility at Eglin AFB, FL.  Additionally, there will be four options established in the contract for different calibration sources: (a) the extended blackbody source (b) variable diameter point source with aperture wheel (c) supplemental cryo-cooling system upgrade (d) and a duplicate optical assemblyIt is the intent of this modification program to perform all changes and modifications in the source chamber and to make little or no changes to the sensor and optics chambers.  The program will end upon successful completion of a Site Acceptance Test (SAT) and delivery of all final documentation.  Specific technical requirements are contained in a document entitled "Specifications and Statement of Requirements For KHILS Vacuum Cryogenic Chamber Modifications" that can be obtained by contacting 1Lt James Norman, AFRL/MNGG, (850) 882-4446 ext 2244, e-mail: james.norman2@eglin.af.mil, and providing a DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement (3) Data Requirements: Developmental Design Drawings and Associated Lists (DI-SESS-81002B); Scientific and Technical Reports - Design Notebook (DI-MISC-80711A/T); Acceptance Test Plan (DI-NDTI-8566); Test/Inspection Report (DI-NDTI-80809B); Presentation Materials (DI-ADMN-81373/T); Conference Minutes (DI-ADMN-81250A); User's Manual (DI-MISC-81414); Status Report ?

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command has a requirement for the Traffic Collision and Avoidance System (TCAS) XS-950 S/I Transponder software modification to Aviation Communication and Surveillance Systems (ACSS) a division of L-3 Communications, Phoenix, AZ.  Change 7 is an upgrade to the TCAS system to incorporate improvements defined by the United States Federal Aviation Administration.  This change, while not being mandated by the FAA as of yet, is required to meet upcoming Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) mandates in Europe.  The term ACAS translates into a TCAS system with Change 7 incorporated.  To meet the ACAS system requirements, the Mode S transponder requires certain minimal functionality and the TCAS/Transponder communication bus protocol must be changed.  The fixed price contract will provide for installation of the new software in approximately 138 boxes currently fielded in the fleet.  ACSS is the sole designer, developer and manufacturer of the XS-950 S/I Transponder.  The XS-950 S/I Transponder designed and produced by ACSS is the only TCAS transponder that has been tested through OPEVAL for use with the Navy. The TCAS is installed in VP-3, UP-3, C/KC-130F/R/T, and C-2A aircraft.  ACSS is the only source that has the background, requisite knowledge, equipment and technical data required to successfully complete the transponder modifications.  Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website and the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central website. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor these sites for addition information pertaining to this requirement. The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) is seeking sources for the development, installation, integration, test and maintenance of the DoD Teleport Management and Control Segment (TMCS) in accordance with the DoD Teleport Management and Control Segment Specification ? Generation One ? SR-140-00-0003.  This information is being solicited as market research for a potential contract in the 1st Quarter of FY03. The DoD Teleport program will provide worldwide-deployed warfighters the expanded communications capability, centralized integration capability, contingency capacity, and the necessary interfaces (satellite and terrestrial) to access the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) in a seamless, interoperable, and economical manner.  The TMCS, an integral part of the Teleport Program, will provide automation at the world-wide Teleport sites to allow for resource configuration and reconfiguration, system controller interfaces, nodal management and control for each Teleport component, and remote access to DISN and SATCOM management and control centers.  The TMCS will allow the Regional Network Operations and Security Center (RNOSC) to remotely monitor major Teleport functions via the Integrated Network Management System (INMS).  The TMCS capability will minimize the amount of hands-on labor required by Teleport personnel.  Control will be maintained through the use of computer terminals and a local area network (LAN).  The TMCS system will expand with each Generation of Teleport to include the new capabilities added in each Generation. Due to the critical nature of the TMCS to the overall operation of the global Teleport program, the TMCS short and long term operations and maintenance are paramount to success.  The system must be installed and integrated on time at worldwide sites that handle communications needs for Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps deployed users.  Thus, a high degree of reliability and availability is understood.  Maintaining the system after integration is at least as important as the success of the initial installation.  Long-term logistics support to the multiple sites in terms of software maintenance, technical support, configuration management, training, and documentation is also critical.

<DESC>The Applied Research Program within the Division of Cancer Control and Population Science, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, plans to negotiate with the School of Public Health, University of California at Los Angeles 90095, for a contract modification for a 30 month period to conduct a state-wide health interview survey in California, called the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS 2003).  The information to be collected will assist in measuring the burden of cancer in the population of the United States. NCI anticipates comparing the CHIS (California Health Interview Survey)  data with NHIS (National Health Interview Survey) and conducting comparative and pooled analyses that will enable better estimates of health-related behaviors and cancer risk factors for smaller racial/ethnic minority populations. California, the most populous state in the nation, is also the most racially and ethnically diverse.  Due to the rich diversity of the California population, data will be collected on a randomly drawn sample, and it will not be necessary to oversample  to obtain detailed information on specific populations and/or health topics. Specific populations of interest include African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans.  With these data, NCI anticipates improving its estimates for cancer risk factors and screening among racial/ethnic minority populations.   Analyses will provide county-level and ethnic group-specific information on cancer prevention and control behaviors and health services utilization and will examine factors responsible for underutilization of preventive services.   The statutory authority for the noncompetitive acquisition is 41 USC 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  Numbered Note 22.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) After date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   No collect calls will be accepted.

Sonatech is the only company the can provide the PWB assemblies because the PWB assemblies will be used with Sonatech transceivers that have already been through operational and technical evaluation.  Use of another company’s PWB may introduce new, or change existing parameters that may induce unacceptable errors into the transceiver.  Failure to have an accurate PWB assembly could result in significant damage to the Sonatech Transceiver.  Therefore Sonatech is the only company that can provide the PWB assemblies.  The PWB assemblies will be delivered to the COASTSYSTA 30 days after award.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Tobacco Control Research Branch (TCRB), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS) plans to enter into a sole source contract with the Society for Research on Nicotine & Tobacco (SRNT), 7611 Elmwood Avenue, Suite 201, Middleton, WI 53562 for the issuance of a Special Issue of Nicotine and Tobacco Research, 1st Annual Conference on Menthol Cigarettes: Setting the Research Agenda.  The TCRB assists in development of research opportunities and dissemination of information garnered from specific research as it relates to tobacco usage in all forms.  Thirty percent of all cancer mortality is attributable to tobacco use, Menthol is the only cigarette additive that is advertised and promoted by the tobacco industry.  Despite its popularity and potential to increase the destructive effects of smoking, there has been relatively little research by public health scientists into the biological and behavioral effects of menthol in cigarettes.  However, the tobacco industry has systematically investigated the role of menthol since its introduction more than 50 years ago.  The articles to be published by the SRNT's journal, a special issue specifically relating to menthol research and racial disparities in cancer risk, will assist the NCI and TCRB in the dissemination of information compiled at the menthol conference, and consequently, help advance the mission of the TCRB.  The SRNT will write, edit and coordinate a peer review of the issue and prepare a "camera-ready galley proof" for publication.  The NCI/TCRB is taking an initiative to publish the presentations of the invited speakers, the lead scientists in nicotine addiction, epidemiology of menthol use, smoking behavior, biochemistry and physiological impact of menthol and the respective field, in the special issue of the Nicotine and Tobacco Research and the Journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco.  The SRNT is the only source known to the Government that can provide the above services in a timely manner and reach the required audiences.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the government requirements.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 12:00 noon EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on September 20, 2002.  If you have any questions, please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent, (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collects will be accepted.  The NAICS Code: 511199 and the business size standard is 500 employees.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial service, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation, No. RFQ-NCI-20161-NV includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2001-08.  The acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial services authorized in FAR 13.6.

The North American Industry Classification code is 541990, and the business size standard is 6M.  This solicitation is set-aside for small business.

Background: The National Cancer Institute?s (NCI) mission is to stimulate and support scientific discovery and its application to achieve a future when all cancers are uncommon and easily treated.  The fact that the burden of cancer is borne unequally in our society is not only a challenge to science but a moral and ethical dilemma for our Nation.  The overarching goal of the NCI articulated in its Strategic Plan to Eliminate Cancer Health Disparities is to understand the causes of cancer health disparities and develop effective interventions to reduce and, ultimately, eliminate them.  To direct the implementation and coordination of activities to achieve this goal, to support NCI health disparities research opportunities, and to provide an organizational locus for NCI in translating discovery into delivery, NCI established the Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CRCHD) in FY 2000.    Through NCI-supported research and extramural programs, CRCHD?s activities are designed to develop a better understanding of the causes of disparities and to support the development of effective, evidence-based strategies to intervene where disparities exist. NCI also has established a variety of infrastructures and initiatives to improve understanding of disparities and develop strategies and interventions to overcome them. These activities provide a firm foundation from which to expand and intensify our efforts as the Institute moves forward to ?bridge the gap? between research discovery and service delivery.   Through the leadership and support of CRCHD, NCI will invest in research to examine the inequalities in cancer and the social, cultural, environmental, biological, and behavioral determinants of cancer, the interactions among them, and the mechanisms by which they contribute to disparities in cancer care and prevention. CRCHD will support initiatives to develop sustainable interventions, and identify priority areas for future policy development that are based on scientific and expert evidence to ameliorate cancer health disparities.  
			
Purpose and Objectives for this procurement:  NCI?s long-term investment in biological research and our more recent investments in behavioral research have helped us make enormous strides in understanding how biological and behavioral factors determine risks for developing or dying from cancer and how interventions can modify these risks.  Much less is known, however, about the effect that factors such as social position, economic status, cultural beliefs and practices, and environmental exposures have on cancer risk.  CRCHD will lead the Institute in examining the relative importance of social causes to their development and their relation to factors that result in unequal access to high quality cancer diagnosis and treatment. To do this, CRCHD will conduct and support fundamental research into the social causes of health disparities, the psychosocial factors that mediate them, and the biologic pathways that can explain their impact.  

CRCHD is developing and will pursue a research framework that builds upon the growing evidence that socioeconomic, cultural, health care provider, institutional, and environmental factors contribute substantially to cancer-related health disparities. The elements that influence health disparities are complex, and their interactions are largely unknown. While health disparities have been framed historically in the context of racial and ethnic disease differences, racial and ethnic classifications have always been socially and politically determined and have no legitimate place in biological science.  There is broad  agreement among experts that racism, borne of racial and ethnic classifications, is rooted in the erroneous concept of biological superiority and is a part of the cultural framework of societal, institutional, and civilizational values that continues to shape scientific thought.  CRCHD has launched a series of workshops and seminars through which we can better address, using new frameworks, the fundamental aspects of population diversity and the development of diseases.  The recommendations emerging from these meetings will form the foundation for NCI?s research and program development.  The power of scientific discovery must be used to elucidate the meaning and effect of the human circumstances in which differential disease burdens occur.

In summary, to reduce cancer-related health disparities in our society, we must understand where biological, behavioral, social, economic, cultural, and environmental factors interface.  We must separate myth from reality to determine what does and does not contribute to these disparities and use that insight to develop new interventions.  And we must design new research investments to explain: 1) the relative importance of social, cultural, and environmental determinants of cancer; 2) how social, cultural, and environmental factors interact with biological and behavioral determinants; and 3) by what mechanisms social, cultural, and environmental determinants may increase cancer incidence and mortality and contribute to cancer-related health disparities

Statement of Work:  Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government as needed to perform the below:

CRCHD activities are wide-ranging and diverse.  The contractor will provide CRCHD with planning, analysis, advice, and working papers to be used in the planning, development, and implementation of various meetings related to cancer health disparities issues, and scientific and technical writing for projects that emerge from these meetings.   The contractor is required to attend and co-lead all planning meetings related to the planning and development of these meetings and projects, and is required to develop working papers that guide the discussion in each meeting.  The contractor is also required to attend any related meetings that the Director, CRCHD deems necessary for the development of the project.  CRCHD plans to conduct a total of seven (7) meetings throughout the year.  These meetings will deal with emerging issues that relate to cancer health disparities and the unequal burden of disease.  The topics of these meetings will vary based on research priorities of the National Cancer Institute?s Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities, and, at times, in partnership with the priorities of the scientific divisions of the National Cancer Institute with respect to emerging issues of concern related to cancer health disparities.  CRCHD may convene up to four (4) planning and leadership meetings (with up to 25 participants), two (2) issues analysis forums (with up to 25 participants), and one (1) large think tank meeting (with up to 100 participants).  The meetings will be by invitation only, and will include clinicians, researchers and nationally and internationally leading experts in a variety of disciplines, advocates, or other individuals.  The contractor is required to attend all meetings, and to be an advisor throughout the meetings to the Director of CRCHD as he leads the proceedings.  These meetings may take place in the Washington D.C. area or elsewhere in the United States, and will last from one (1) to three (3) days. The following is a description of each type of meeting: 1)  Planning Meeting - No more than 25 experts will be invited to participate in a discussion to examine the scope and characteristics of a specific issue related to health disparities, and will outline a plan of action to address this issue. (One to two days in length); 2)
Leadership meeting - No more than 25 experts, NCI and CRCHD staff will develop and lead the implementation of a plan of action to address a specific issue.  Similar to planning meetings in format and length of meeting; 3)  Issues Analysis forum - No more than 25 experts will be invited to evaluate and analyze the evidence compiled, including literature surveys, surveillance evidence reviews, etc., related to a specific issue.  Similar to Planning and leadership meetings in format and length of meeting; and 4)  Roundtable Meeting - No more than 100 persons will be invited to participate in a roundtable discussion to carefully examine the breadth of the issue, identify alternative evidence-based solutions and develop effective strategies to eliminate factors that contribute to cancer health disparities.  The meeting will have an individualized format based on the scope of the issue.  (One to three days in length).  Delierables:  Immediately upon award of the order, the contractor should schedule a meeting with the Program Officer to discuss upcoming meetings and pre-meeting deliverables:  1)  Draft working papers for planning and development of initiatives on specific topic(s);  2)  Agendas and discussion guide;  3)  if needed, deliver meeting notes to CRCHD program officer within 2 days of the meeting;  4)  analyses of the proceedings of all meetings;  5)  participate, and at the discretion of the Director CRCHD, lead working group meetings to develop and implement think tanks on specific topics identified by the CRCHD Director; and 6) at the discretion of the Director CRCHD, write speeches on topics related to cancer health disparities that will be delivered to national and international audiences.  All files should be produced and delivered in electronic version (email and disc).  Electronic products and communication must be compatible with CRCHD software (WordPerfect 8, Microsoft word, Microsoft excel, Microsoft power point). 

Period of Performance:   It is anticipated that award will be for a one year base period plus 2 one year option periods if exercised by the Government.  FAR Clause 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (March 2000) shall apply to any award made from this solicitation.

Contractor Requirements:
The contractor will work closely with the Director, and Deputy Director, and senior staff of CRCHD to plan, analyse, research, advise, and develop reports, speeches, and other relevant written documents related to understanding cancer health disparities, and developing effective evidence-based interventions to reduce, and ultimately eliminate them.  

The contractor must demonstrate direct involvement with developing policy documents and other relevant material regarding cancer health disparities and must demonstrate a high level of involvement working with national leaders dealing with issues related to racial/ethnic issues, and analyzing cancer statistics and research pertinent to cancer health disparities.  The contractor will be directly involved in the planning and development of programs to accomplish these objectives.  Thus, it is mandatory that the contractor demonstrate a level of analysis, understanding and functional ability to examine and integrate ideas that span a broad range of disciplines such as anthropology, philosophy, and sociology, particularly with respect to racial and ethnic studies, cross-cultural analysis.  The offeror must show a high degree of understanding of the health disparities issues outlined in the most recently published Institute of Medicine report published by the National Academy of Sciences Press, Unequal Treatment, Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care,  http://stills.nap.edu/books/030908265X/html and demonstrate a command of the extent of racial and ethnic disparities in health care, sources of disparities in cancer care and the barriers to care that exist for minority and underserved populations.   Strong analytical skills are critical to the needs of CRCHD since the contractor is expected to participate in the planning, development of broad national policy issues and recommendations and formulation of reports on complex meta-analyses of the various issues that impact on cancer health disparities and that have broad-based implications for national policy development. 

Evaluation Criteria:

Award will be based on an evaluation of proposals against three factors.  The factors in order of importance are:  technical: Demonstrated understanding of the issues described in the statement of work, including experience writing analyses of and issues related to health disparities, particularly in cancer and other chronic diseases, including the latest research and major barriers to cancer care; past performance:  List of 5 references where similar or related work was performed: should include Agency, PO W/phone number; CO w/phone number; Title of Project; Period of Performance; total price; and cost.  Although technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of this order, both past performance and cost/price are also important to the overall contract award decision.  All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price alone.  Offerors are advised that award will be made to that offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government, all of the above factors considered.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation to procure commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12.6, as supplemented with the additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is being issued as a request for quotation.  Submit offers to RFQ #02057.  This solicitation document and its incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2001-09(a).  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the acquisition is 481219 and the small-business size standard is $6,000,000.  The International Center for Excellence in Research (ICER) is supporting the continuing research efforts of the Rakai Project in Uganda.  The Rakai Project, established in 1988, is a research and training collaboration between the Uganda Virus Research Institute/Uganda Ministry of Health; researchers at Makerere University in Kampala; Columbia University; Johns Hopkins University; and intramural scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). The project operates in the rural Rakai District in Southwestern Uganda and has established one of the largest HIV and reproductive health population-based cohorts in the world.   Currently, the cohort population is approximately 12,000 persons, aged 15-49, residing in 50 rural communities.  The project performs many research activities on HIV and STDs (HSV-2, HPV, Syphilis, Gonorrhea, Chlamydia and Trichomona, Bacterial Vaginosis/BV), including their effects on pregnancy, fertility, infant survival, placental pathology and mother-to-child HIV transmission.  To assist in this project, the NIAID is sending approximately 24,000 lbs. of laboratory materials to Rakai.  The items are needed now and waiting the six (6) months that sea and land-based shipping would take is not acceptable; consequently, we are seeking a contractor that can meet the following requirements:  The contractor must receive the freight in a warehouse (at no additional cost to the NIAID) and do a detailed inventory of each item that comes in.  The NIAID Project Officer will provide the contractor with NIAID purchase order and other documentation needed to do an acceptable inventory.  This will include items that the contractor will receive from Johns Hopkins and Cornell Universities.  The contractor must note shortages, overages, expiration dates, voltages, and other crucial information relevant to the items that will be shipped.  The contractor must hold the cargo at the warehouse until all items for a particular shipment have arrived and the NIAID Project Officer has given them authorization to ship.  A Rakai Project representative will inform the contractor what each shipment should consist of.  Once the contractor has received shipping authorization, they must assemble the items on hand and pack them into tri-wall boxes or crates in order to eliminate any potential damage.  (The choice of container is at the contractor's discretion; however, the container must provide optimal protection at the least expense to the government.)  The contractor must do a detailed inventory of each item packed per box.  This inventory must be completely accurate to facilitate customs inspection in Uganda by enabling the customs agent to look at a specific item quickly and easily.  Therefore, the contractor must pack and inventory the items in a fashion that alleviates the necessity for customs agents to search through each and every box.  If there is anything delicate in the shipment, the contractor must insure that it will not be broken in transit by using void packs or any other means necessary to prevent breakage.  The contractor must also keep all items refrigerated that need to be refrigerated, both in the warehouse before shipment and during transport. Once the items are packed, the contractor must produce a full set of documents for the shipment.  These documents shall include, but not be limited to, a packing list, a valued inventory and a commercial invoice. The contractor will be provided with courtesy copies of the invoices for each incoming shipment.  (As noted earlier, orders will originate from NIAID, Johns Hopkins or Cornell.)  Packing lists will be included in each delivery.  The contractor will be responsible for preparing the "valued inventory" based on the documentation that is provided for (and with) each shipment.  The contractor shall be held fully responsible the preparation of all required import and export documentation.  The contractor must e-mail and fax all of these documents and whatever is stipulated by the NIAID Project Officer to the people involved in the shipment several days prior to the shipment's estimated arrival in Uganda.  (A list of Rakai Project representatives involved in the shipments will be provided to the contractor before the onset of the contract.)  This will allow the authorized agent in Uganda to begin the customs process; moreover, it will allow the goods to be delivered in a timely manner.  The contractor must then transport the goods to the airport that they will be shipped from.  Once the shipment has left the contractor's warehouse, the contractor must have the ability to trace the shipment prior to, during and after each flight.  Shipping & receiving report updates must be sent to the Project Officer upon request.  Upon each shipment's arrival, the contractor must contact the authorized agent to confirm arrival and then send confirmation to all of the parties as directed by the Project Officer.  The contractor must then stay in contact with the agent in Uganda to make sure the delivery goes smoothly and arrives timely at its final destination.  The contractor must then send confirmation of safe passage via email to the NIAID Project Officer. The contractor shall be held responsible for all aspects of shipping.  At no point should NIAID personnel be involved in getting the shipment through customs. The contractor must be able to demonstrate consistent experience shipping scientific equipment and supplies to Uganda.  The anticipated period of performance will be September 30, 2002 through September 29, 2003.  During this period, we anticipate that the contractor will be required to make four (4) six-ton air deliveries to Rakai.  The government intends to make a best value buy to the responsible offeror whose offer is most advantageous to the government.  The evaluation criteria will include 1) price, 2) technical experience and 3) ability to meet the government's delivery schedule.  FAR provisions and clauses that apply to this acquisition are FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4, Contractor Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items.  Offerors must include with their offer a completed copy of the provisions of FAR 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items.  Offers must be submitted not later than 5:00 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time, September 25, 2002.  For delivery of responses through the Postal Service, the address is NIH/NIAID/AMOB; 10401 Fernwood Drive; MSC 4811, Room 2N370D; Bethesda, MD  20817.  Electronic submissions will not be accepted.  Requests for information concerning this requirement are to be addressed to Guy Baratte at (301) 594-3419.  Collect calls will not be accepted.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  Submit offers on RFQ0261.  The request for quotation (RFQ) and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-09.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a small business set-aside.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends to procure Laboratory Testing Services. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541380 and the Small Business Standard Size is 6 Million.  The purpose of this requirement is to develop vaccines for HIV, Ebola and potentially, other viral diseases.

<DESC>This Just In Time Bushing Program is in support of Naval Aircraft.  Uncoated bushings are to be delivered within 3 working days.  CAD plated bushings to be delivered within 5 working days, and IVD coated bushings to be delivered within 12 working days.  All bushings will require Non Destructive Inspection (NDI) prior to shipment.
The anticipated scope of the proposed contract will include, but not be limited to, all bushings in the aircraft maintained by the Naval Aviation Depots.  The bushings will be solicited in phases.  Only those manufacturers that are found qualified during the initial solicitation will be considered for the follow-up proposals.  
The minimally acceptable on-time delivery history in the 3120 class is 90%.  Those that have not performed work in the 3120 federal supply class will be judged based on the government contracts they receive.  Manufacturers not meeting this standard will not be considered for contract award.  Additionally, any perspective manufacturers must have a minimum of three (3) CNC lathes and three (3) CNC mills.  The capacity of the CNC machines will be evaluated to ensure they have adequate memory to store numerous bushing programs.  Additionally, government customers will be contacted to provide feedback on their level of satisfaction on performance issues.
Drawings will be mailed out with the solicitation.  Please contact Albert Whitley, (804) 279-5702, e-mail address Albert.Whitley@dscr.dla.mil to request a copy of the solicitation.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC located in Greenbelt, MD intends to extend the period of performance for support services from Reston Consulting Group (RCG).  The period of performance for the extension is October 29, 2002 through September 30, 2003.   RCG supports the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment(GLOBE)project.	GLOBE is a hands on program that joins students, educators, and scientists from around the world in studying the global environment.  RCG provides support through a number of public-private partnerships, including those with 97 countries and approximately 150 organizations in the United States. RCG provides GLOBE-certified master trainers to support NASA. Provision of training and related support is one of the key obligations of the US Government under its national and international partnership agreements. NASA is working to transition GLOBE via a competitive Cooperative Agreement Notice (CAN) to a cooperative agreement recipient.  Any disruption to operations could irreparably jeopardize the on-going success and even viability of GLOBE.=20= =20=20 THE AUTHORITY FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source. NASA/GSFC has a 6 to 12 month training period to become a GLOBE-certified master trainer. A GLOBE-certified master trainer trains GLOBE national and international partners in the use of GLOBE's Website for data gathering and support. RCG's master trainers understand the processes through which GLOBE arranges and supports training.	RCG also provides extensive communications with national and international partners using NASA and contractor specific computer based technologies.   There would be a significant learning curve and expense for another contractor to become capable of providing training and obtaining the required GLOBE certifications.  This is not practical given the fact that this is a interim contract lasting less than one year.= =20 Also, there would be a significant transition in this service, which would be repeated when the transition to the Cooperative agreement occurs.  The continued use of RCG with their proven systems would minimize or eliminate any disruption to service. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on _before October 9, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". All qualified responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

<CONTACT>David Bales, Contract Administrator, Phone (915) 696-2679, Fax (915) 696-4078, Email David.Bales@dyess.af.mil
<DESC>Questions and Answers for B1 Wing Maintenance Stands

1)  Is the contractor limited to fabricating the maintenance platforms from either aluminum or 
    stainless steel?

Answer:  Aluminum or Stainless Steel are the only acceptable metals.  However, Aluminum is preferred.
 
2)  What is the desired platform working height from the ground? Are we to assume the following?
     a)  Inboard platform floor shall be 5 ft. from the ground with the ability to raise or lower 2 1/2 ft.
     b)  Middle platform floor shall be 4 ft. from the ground with the ability to raise or lower 2 ft.
     c)  Outboard platform floor shall be 3 ft. from the ground with the ability to raise or lower 1 ? ft.
     Considering this assumption, if the inboard section is at 2 1/2 ft. up and the outboard section is 1 1/2 ft. down there will be a 6 ft. overall drop from the inboard section to the outboard section. Is this a problem?

Answer:  The total movement of the stands should make them 5?, 4?, and 3?.  For example, they should move from 0? to 5?, from 0? to 4?, and from 0? to 3?.
 
3)  Please explain further the phrase " 36 inches of downward height adjustment for platform leveling " as related to the other height requirements of 5 ft., 4 ft., and 3 ft.

Answer:  See question #3
 
4)	Do handrails and toe guards need to be provided for autonomous use of each section? 

Answer:  No
 
5)	Is chain acceptable in lieu of ridged construction for the handrails for the platforms?

Answer:  No
 
6)  The synopsis states " Segments must provide access to the overwing fairing area while engine panels are swung open. " Does this mean all segments inboard, center, and outboard?

Answer:  There must be a 36? walkway between the Aircraft and the inner most stand.  This will allow for all clearance needed.
 
6)	Is the step-fast and hand-operated jacks redundant or both required?

Answer:  These are the same thing.
 
7)	What is the desired finish requirement i.e. primer and paint?

Answer:  Primer and paint.

8)	Will these stands be used in phase dock or on the flightline?

Answer:  Both

9)	Total assembly time of two weeks, is this for all the stands or just for 1 set for an aircraft?

Answer:  The assembly time is time needed for assembly at Dyess, not assembly time for the stand from inception to completion.  The lead time for design, build, delivery, and assembly is 180 days after receipt of order.

10)	Is one set of stands classified as 6 stands?  2 each 5?, 4?, 3? for each side of the aircraft?

Answer:  One set of stands is 6 individual stands, 3 for each side of the aircraft.

11)	What is the total sets needed on this RFQ?

Answer:  One set

1.  There will be no abort switches for the AFFF fire control system in the North Bay.  This is per McConnell?s Fire Department........ 

2.  Persons installing fire control panels must be certified or have a certified person present...........

3.  All panels must be installed and meet standards according to the NFPA 72 code manual..........

4. The gas detection system is a separate system and not part of current requirement.............

8.  The questions came up that ?If the cost to install an addressable fire alarm control is more cost effective than a conventional system would that be an acceptable offer?. The answer to this is the following.  Any contractor has the right to submit an unsolicited proposal/quote (unsolicited, in this case, meaning it meets the ultimate requirement, however, deviating in the process). The only caution I would advise is that the customer has outlined what their requirement is and what they want to see in the quotes. If the proposal does not meet this requirement it could potentially be eliminated.  My suggestions would be to submit two proposals in this case......................

9.  It is not necessary for those submitting proposals to be Monaco Factory Trained.................... 

10. There will be no drawings posted for the system, however, the operational sequence document of the fire alarm sytem to which the control panels will be connected is available upon request, as mentioned above. Any questions or concerns please contact Lt Laura Farley at 316-759-3059..................

<DESC>ADAPTIVE AND REFLECTIVE MIDDLEWARE SYSTEMS (ARMS),
SOL BAA 02-24, DUE:  10/31/02; POC:  DR. DOUGLAS C. SCHMIDT, DARPA/IXO; FAX: (703) 522-7161

PROGRAM SCOPE

The objective of the ARMS program is to create technologies and tools that will dramatically simplify distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) middleware development, optimization, validation, and DoD combat systems. The middleware technologies and tools created in the ARMS program will focus on the challenging problems and risks associated with the development of a Total Ship Computing Environment (TSCE) in the DD(X) Future Surface Combatant Family of Ships.  The TSCE will be a fully integrated open system computing and information architecture that executes all tasks and mission applications optimized at the platform level, rather than the sub-system level, thus breaking down the traditional C4ISR, Combat Systems, and Ship Control System boundaries.  ARMS technologies and tools will allow researchers and DD(X) system integrators to develop and evolve complex DRE combat systems assuredly, adaptively, and affordably by:
-Supporting dynamic allocation and migration of DRE applications with their associated security level across a wide array of general-purpose computing resources to maximize survivability and mission availability in the face of equipment failure, battle damage, software failures, and information warfare attacks 
-Standardizing COTS at the middleware level (rather than just at lower hardware/networks/OS levels)  
-Devising meta-programmable DRE framework techniques and optimizations, as well as secure multi-level distributed dynamic resource management protocols/services for adaptive and reflective middleware that will enable DoD DRE systems to customize standard COTS interfaces, without the performance and flexibility penalties incurred by conventional COTS implementations and
-Building middleware services that enable applications to be independent of the particular resource management protocols, security policies, and fault tolerant mechanisms required.

For this BAA, there are two proposal categories, "Technology Developer" and "OEP Developer".  An organization may submit multiple proposals in each proposal category, however an organization's eligibility for funding is restricted to one of these categories.

OEP Developer

The OEP Developer supplies the ARMS program with specific challenge problems that describe the current operational state in the TSCE domain and describe quantifiable performance-oriented goals that will enable significant increases in overall domain performance, but also require significant technological innovation to realize. The OEP Developer will integrate ARMS technologies into the TSCE testbed as an objective evaluator, conduct formal experiments, analyze results, and feed recommendations back to the Technology Developers (TDs).

The OEP Developer will be the liaison between the TDs and the DD(X) Design Agent, and is responsible for conveying the DD(X) requirements, risks, complex computing system problems and other development needs to the TDs and for ensuring the TDs are addressing these needs. The OEP Developer will establish an Integrated Data Environment (IDE). This IDE will allow DARPA, the DD(X) Program Office, DD(X) Design Agent, and other DARPA approved Government laboratories remote digital access to ARMS Program documentation, software, and other developed technologies to facilitate the open communication and transition of information and technologies to the DD(X) Design Agent.

A primary emphasis of the OEP Developer experimental evaluation is the Quality of Service (QoS) of the ARMS DRE middleware. In that capacity, the ARMS OEP Developer will devise and validate methods and tools for evaluating the aggregate QoS of the ARMS DRE middleware and representative TSCE applications in terms of their latency/jitter, throughput, scalability, adaptability, stability, dependability, security, and static/dynamic reflective optimization capabilities. The OEP Developer will make the challenge problems, applications, and the integrated testbed itself accessible for all the TDs in the ARMS program.

Proposers in the OEP Developer category must propose a software test platform consistent with the TSCE concept described in the ARMS Program Background section, as well as specific challenge problems on which objective evaluation will be based.  Offerors for OEP Developer should demonstrate an ability to integrate ARMS tools into integrated end-to-end development scenarios and perform rigorous testing and evaluation of the resulting design frameworks.  Proposals in the OEP Developer area must delineate the constraints and performance drivers and must suggest test and evaluation methodologies for ARMS experiments based on their OEP.

It is anticipated that at most two OEP proposals will be selected for possible funding.

Technology Developer

Proposals are also solicited in two topical areas in the "Technology Developer" (TD) research category in the context of the testbed provided by the OEP Developer described above.  The two TD topical areas are described below:

Topic 1.  Meta-programmable DRE Middleware Frameworks

DARPA is seeking proposals that will develop new theory, framework technologies, and tools for applying meta-programming techniques to DRE middleware and applications. Meta-programming involves policies and mechanisms that systematically decouple the functional path of an application from its various cross-cutting QoS properties and resources by decomposing the system into:
?	Base-components, which implement certain application functionality (such as sensor processing, tracking, and weapons release/control) and
?	Meta-components, which abstract key QoS properties (such as persistence, concurrency, scheduling priorities, atomicity, ordering, state, replication, and change notifications) from base-objects and control many aspects of their behavior adaptively and reflectively at run-time. 

Proposers of new meta-programmable DRE frameworks should demonstrate expertise in one or more areas of interest to  DoD combat system developers, such as time/space constraints, real-time QoS goals, cross-cutting aspects (such as security, predictability, and dependability), and open middleware standards.  Proposers should focus on demonstrating their expertise in the context of concrete DRE middleware for DoD combat systems.  Proposers must show how they can interface their frameworks with other ARMS components through common interface languages and knowledge representations, such as those based on UML/OCL, XML, Rational Rose, CORBA IDL, and others (such as those developed on the DARPA MoBIES project).  The interfaces and functional semantics of all meta-programmable DRE frameworks must be provided in open, extensible, well-documented formats, compliant with the middleware standards ARMS is developing and leveraging.  Frameworks developed for ARMS will be evaluated heavily on the ease with which they can be integrated with other frameworks and with standards-based meta-programmable middleware environments, such as the OMG Model Driven Architecture (MDA) efforts.

Proposals for meta-programmable DRE middleware frameworks should contain a description of their candidate middleware architecture, identify policies (explicitly or implicitly) on how data and resources it owns are used, document external and internal dependencies/constraints imposed, as well as rational of proposed middleware architecture and the process via which other ARMS Technology and OEP Developers will integrate their technologies with it.  The product of projects in this area should be capable of being transitioned to the middleware software market in the form of open protocols and interface standards.  Proposers in this area should also be able to work with and participate in standards bodies, such as the OMG or The Open Group, that are defining the protocols and interfaces necessary for DRE middleware interoperability.

It is anticipated that no more than four proposals will be selected in this area for possible funding and teaming is encouraged.

Topic 2.  Secure Multi-level Distributed Resource Management

DARPA is seeking proposals that will develop and evaluate a new generation of DRE middleware that can manage system resources adaptively and reflectively across multiple security levels of distributed systems in real-time. The goal of this task is to substantially improve the ability of middleware to enable applications and users to reason about and manage resources dynamically and dependably within multiple levels (i.e., networks, operating systems, and several layers of middleware) of complex DRE systems. The results will allow applications and users better control over these complex systems by (1) deferring the commitment of many resources from design-time until run-time, without sacrificing overall system predictability and dependability and (2) allowing higher-level mission doctrine to determine tradeoffs between resource allocation and reallocation strategies, thereby enhancing overall system effectiveness, verifiability, and lethality.

Proposals for secure multi-level distributed resource management should contain a description of their candidate middleware architecture, identify policies (explicitly or implicitly) on how data and resources it owns are used, document external and internal dependencies/constraints imposed, as well as rational of proposed middleware architecture and the process via which ARMS will integrate technologies with it.  Proposers in this area should demonstrate expertise in integrating meta-programmable DRE middleware frameworks with secure multi-level distributed resource management capabilities to form a coherent development tool suite suitable for the needs of the TSCE.  The product of projects in this area should be capable of being transitioned to the middleware software market in the form of open protocols and interface standards.  Proposers in this area should also be able to work with and participate in standards bodies, such as the OMG or The Open Group, that are defining the protocols and interfaces necessary for DRE middleware interoperability.

It is anticipated that no more than four proposals will be selected in this area for possible funding and teaming is encouraged.

For each Category: Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art.  Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies listed above, and alternative visions will be considered.  However, proposals should be for research that substantially contributes towards the goals stated.  Research should result in prototype DRE middleware software demonstrating integrated concepts and approaches. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice or focuses purely on non-empirical methods.  Integrated solution sets embodying significant technological advances are strongly encouraged over narrowly defined research endeavors.

The period of performance for proposed research efforts should be no longer than three years in duration, with demonstrable goals that can be evaluated empirically at the midway point (18 months).  Offerors in both categories, OEP and TD, must specify metrics associated with performance-based milestones that will enable DARPA management to systematically gauge the technical progress of the proposed effort.

Teaming is encouraged and proposals may involve multiple research groups and/or industrial cooperation and cost sharing.

<DESC>GENERAL INFORMATION (See BAA02-24 Part 1 for Program Scope Info.) 

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency/Information Exploitation Office (DARPA/IXO) requires completion of a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Cover Sheet Submission for each Abstract/Proposal, by accessing the URL below:

http://www.dyncorp-is.com/BAA/index.asp?BAAid=02-24

After finalizing the BAA Cover Sheet Submission, the proposer must print the BAA Confirmation Sheet that will automatically appear on the web page.  Each proposer is responsible for printing the BAA Confirmation Sheet and attaching it to the 
"original" and each designated number of copies.  The Confirmation Sheet should be the first page of your Abstract/Proposal.  If a proposer intends on submitting more than one Abstract/Proposal, a unique UserId and password should be used in creating each BAA Cover Sheet.  Failure to comply with these submission procedures may result in the submission not being evaluated.  

PROPOSAL FORMAT

Proposers must submit an original and 4 copies of the full proposal and 2 electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the full proposal (in Microsoft Word ?97 for IBM-compatible, PDF, Postscript, or ASCII format on one 3.5-inch floppy disk or one 100 MB Iomega Zip disk).  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 02-XX, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy ___ of 2.  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted in time to reach DARPA by 12:00 NOON Local Time, Thursday, 10/31/02, in order to be considered during the initial evaluation phase.  However, BAA 02-24 will remain open until 12:00 NOON Local Time, Friday, 10/31/03.  Thus, proposals may be submitted at any time from issuance of this BAA through Friday, 10/31/03. While the proposals submitted after Thursday, 10/31/02, deadline will be evaluated by the Government, proposers should be mindful that the likelihood of funding such proposals is less than for those proposals submitted in connection with the initial evaluation and award schedule.

Proposers must obtain the BAA 02-24 Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP), which provides further information on the areas of interest, submission, evaluation, funding processes, proposal abstracts, and full proposal formats.

<DESC>PROGRAM COMPOSITION OF EMBEDDED SYSTEMS (PCES),
SOL BAA 02-25, DUE:  10/31/02; POC:  DR. DOUGLAS C. SCHMIDT, DARPA/IXO; FAX: (703) 522-7161	

PROGRAM SCOPE

The objective of the Program Composition for Embedded Systems (PCES) is to create new language and compiler technology for developing distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) middleware and applications that reduces complexity by separating application functional concerns (such as exploitation algorithms, rules of engagement processing, or weapons targeting) from cross-cutting systemic concerns (such as synchronization of concurrent operations, processor fault isolation, sensor input and actuator output timing constraints, distribution, and safe/efficient cache, register, and memory management).  The Sensor-to-Decision Maker-Shooter/Weapons (SDMS/W) kill chain used to prosecute Time Critical Targets (TCTs) is an excellent example of DRE systems and their need for highly flexible, dependable, and efficient software.  The kill chain refers to the Find, Fix, Track, Target, Engage, and Assess (F2T2EA) process used by an Air Operations Center (AOC) to commit strike resources against a TCT.  All of these operations must be accomplished within a short time window to destroy elusive mobile targets.  Since attack maneuvering and the weapon alignment and fly out consume most of the time interval, the actual strike decision must be made by the legal authorities and relayed to the pilot and/or weapon within seconds of combat identification of the target.  

The PCES program addresses the following factors that have historically increased software fragility and total ownership costs and imperiled the success of numerous new and planned DoD programs:
1.	Multiple platform and varying operational contexts. DoD systems must invest an ever-increasing proportion of functionality in DRE software to retain technological dominance. Rapidly emerging technologies and flexibility required for diverse operational contexts force deployment of multiple versions of software on various platform architectures, while preserving key properties, such as secure, dependable, and real-time response.  
2.	Total ownership costs. Software development and evolution is labor-intensive and error-prone for complex DoD DRE systems and can represent over 50% of the total ownership costs of these systems.    
3.	Obsolescence trends. Incommensurate lifetimes between DoD systems (20 years or more) and computational platform (2-5 years) lead to pervasive software obsolescence and multiply the total ownership costs by requiring periodic software re-development and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) refresh.    

This BAA solicits proposals in two research categories, "Open Experimentation Platform (OEP) Developer" and "Technology Developer."  Offerors in both categories must specify metrics associated with performance-based milestones that enable DARPA management to systematically gauge the technical progress of the proposed effort.  The period of performance for proposed research efforts should be no longer than two years in duration.

OEP Developer

The OEP Developer supplies the PCES program with specific challenge problems that must describe the current operational state in the domain of Sensor-to-Decision Maker-Shooter (SDMS/W) systems, and describe quantifiable performance-oriented goals that would enable significant increases in overall domain performance, but also require significant technological innovation to realize. The OEP developer will also integrate PCES technologies into the SDMS/W testbed as an objective evaluator, conduct formal experiments, analyze results, and feed recommendations back to the Technology Developers (TDs). 

The primary emphasis of this experimental evaluation is the quality (both at design time and at run-time) of the PCES DRE middleware. In that capacity, the OEP developer will devise and validate methods and tools for evaluating the aggregate QoS of the PCES DRE middleware and representative SDMS/W applications in terms of their flexibility, correctness, latency/jitter, throughput, scalability, adaptability, stability, dependability, and optimization capabilities. The OEP Developer will make the challenge problems, SDMS/W applications, and the integrated SDMS/W testbed itself accessible for all the TDs in the PCES program.

Proposers in the OEP Developer category should propose a SDMS/W software test platform of interest to the Armed Services, as well as specific challenge problems on which objective evaluation will be based.  Offerors for OEP Developer should demonstrate an ability to integrate PCES tools into integrated end-to-end development scenarios and perform rigorous testing and evaluation of the resulting design frameworks.  Proposals in the OEP Developer area must delineate the SDMS/W constraints and performance drivers and must suggest test and evaluation methodologies for PCES experiments based on their OEP.

It is anticipated that no more than one proposal will be selected in this area for possible funding.

Technology Developer

Proposals are also solicited in two topical areas in the "Technology Developer" (TD) research category in the context of the SDMS/W testbed provided by the OEP Developer described above.  The two TD topical areas are described below:

Topic 1.	  DRE Middleware Generation and Optimization Tools

DARPA is seeking proposals that will develop languages, algorithms, patterns, and code bases to support the generation and optimization of DRE middleware that can be customized for specific mission requirements and constraints of DoD SDMS/W systems and applications. The middleware will be generated automatically and optimized via algorithms that can be tailored declaratively to adapt to key DRE platform characteristics, e.g., interconnection mechanisms, event demultiplexing mechanisms, I/O mechanisms, synchronization and concurrency mechanisms, failure detection and recovery mechanisms, configuration mechanisms, and power levels. Automating the configuration and optimization of DRE middleware is essential since the need for stringent behavioral assurance makes verification and empirical validation of the customized middleware components necessary. Moreover, these capabilities will ensure that DoD systems can leverage standards-based COTS while simultaneously ensuring that key protocol, implementation, and QoS properties can remain unique in order to retain superiority over adversaries who have access to the same standards-based COTS middleware.

Proposers of new DRE middleware generation and optimization tools should demonstrate expertise in one or more areas of interest to DRE developers, such as time/space constraints, real-time performance goals, cross-cutting aspects, and/or open middleware standards.  Proposals should discuss the importance and prevalence of these features in the context of DRE middleware and SDMS/W systems.  Proposers should also be able to interface to other PCES components through common interface languages and knowledge representations, such as those based on UML/OCL, XML, Rational Rose, CORBA IDL, and others (such as those developed on the DARPA MoBIES project).  The interfaces and functional semantics of all DRE middleware generation and optimization tools will be required to be provided in open, extensible, well-documented formats, compliant with the middleware standards PCES is developing and leveraging.  Tools developed for PCES will be evaluated heavily on the ease with which they can be integrated with other tools and with standards-based middleware environments, such as the OMG Model Driven Architecture (MDA) efforts.

Any number of different tools may be proposed in a given proposal, though each proposal must comply with all submission requirements including page limits given in this PIP.  Each DRE middleware generation and optimization tool proposed should be structured as a unique, separately priced task option so that a subset of those tools proposed might be targeted for funding. One or more tool options may be targeted for funding from a given proposal, though it is anticipated that no more than four DRE middleware generation and optimization proposals will be selected for possible funding and teaming is encouraged.

Topic 2.	Distributed Quality Aspects

DARPA is seeking proposals that will develop new theory, technology, and tools for applying aspect-oriented techniques to DRE middleware and applications.  In particular, DARPA is seeking innovative techniques that can collect, organize, and disseminate QoS-related meta-information needed to (1) monitor and manage how well the functional interactions occur in SDMS/W systems and (2) enable the decision-making needed to support systemic QoS properties robustly in the face of rapidly changing SDMS/W mission requirements and environmental conditions. These middleware capabilities are crucial to ensure that the aggregate behavior of complex network-centric SDMS/W systems is dependable, despite local failures, transient overloads, and dynamic functional or QoS reconfigurations.

Proposals for distributed quality aspects should contain a description of their candidate middleware architecture and the process via which PCES will integrate technologies with it. To promote a common technology base, the interfaces and (where appropriate) the protocols used by PCES middleware should be based on (or should guide) established or emerging industry or DoD standards that are relevant for DoD DRE systems. However, the aspect-oriented technologies developed in the PCES program should also be customizable?statically and dynamically?for specific DoD DRE application and mission requirements. Proposers in this area should also be able to work with and participate in standards bodies, such as the OMG and The Open Group, that are defining the protocols and interfaces necessary for PCES middleware interoperability. 

It is anticipated that no more than four proposals will be selected in this area for possible funding and teaming is encouraged.
 
Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art.  Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies listed above, and alternative visions will be considered.  However, proposals should be for research that substantially contributes towards the goals stated.  Research should result in prototype DRE middleware software demonstrating integrated concepts and approaches. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice or focuses purely on non-empirical methods.  Integrated solution sets embodying significant technological advances are strongly encouraged over narrowly defined research endeavors.  Teaming is encouraged and proposals may involve multiple research groups and/or industrial cooperation and cost sharing.  The period of performance for proposed research efforts should be no longer than three years in duration. This BAA shall remain open and proposals received up to one year following this BAA?s release.

<ARCHDATE>11222002
<CONTACT>Emil Maslanka, 309-782-3420
<DESC>NA The OSC, in support of PM ARM, issued a sources sought announcement in both the Commerce Business Daily and the Army Single Face to Industry Acquisition Business Web Site o/a 8 November 2001 seeking interested potential system integration offerors in a fut ure solicitation for an Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS). That announcement briefly stated that a solicitation was to be issued to cover System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase which was basically qualifying a M151 2.75 inch rocket wi th a guidance component under a performance specification with options for: acquiring long lead materials/initial production facilities, engineering services, Low Rate Initial Production, the first year of full production, and acquiring a Technical Data Pa ckage. A multi-step approach was being considered. The announcement also stated that a subsequent production contract would be awarded on a Firm Fixed Price and sole source basis to the successful system integration offeror of the SDD contract provided the  required performance was achieved and maintained.  It was anticipated that the production contract would be a five-year award term with a potential extension to another five years with successful performance against measured criteria. In addition to the g uided M151 2.75 inch rocket, the production contract would have been flexible to include a family of other precision rockets that may have included the current configuration M261, M264, M255A1, M229 M257, and M278 2.75 inch rockets, with or without a guida nce component, system integration functions, technology enhancements, inventory upgrades, block upgrades, and engineering services. Potential offerors timely responded to this announcement.  Subsequent to this announcement, a thorough analysis was undertaken relative to the impacts this original acquisition approach had on the Government’s ability to preserve a critical industrial supplier capability for the family of 2.75 inch rockets. As par t of this analysis, ongoing communications have been held with all the potential offerors who responded to the original announcement. The purpose of this notice is to formally state the new acquisition approach that has been communicated over the past seve ral months to all the potential offerors who responded to the original announcement by amending the previous announcement placed in both the Commerce Business Daily and the Army Single Face to Industry Acquisition Business Web Site o/a 8 November 2001 for the benefit of other interested parties. APKWS has been further defined as an umbrella program that initially includes the guided M151 2.75 inch rocket with future block upgrades and also includes a family of other precision and unguided rockets utilizing existing warheads (M151, M261, M264, M267, M255A1, M229, M257, M274, M278, and WTU-1/B), with or without a guidance component, system integration functions, technology enhancements, inventory upgrades, logistics support, initial production facilities, prod ucibility issues, investigation support, future block upgrades, enhancing digital capabilities to include an improved launcher, test equipment, packaging, and engineering services. The Government intends to enter into a 5 year Award Term sole source contra ct with General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products (GDATP) for APKWS with the capability to extend the contract up to an additional five annual performance periods if actual contract performance meets or exceeds the standards established in the award  term plan. Additionally, it is anticipated that GDATP will issue a competitive solicitation for the guidance component to cover a System Development and Demonstration phase, which is basically qualifying a M151 2.75 inch rocket with a guidance component u nder a performance specification with possible options for: acquiring long lead materials/initial production facilities, engineering services, low rate initial production, two years of full production, production represent ative samples, etc. It is also anticipated that GDATP will issue this draft solicitation for the guidance component within 30 days. The draft solicitation will also outline a potential subcontract award schedule. The Government plans to participate and/or assist in the evaluation of GDATP’s subcontract offerors received in response to their solicitation for a guidance component for the M151 2.75 inch rocket. HOWEVER, IT MUST BE CLEARLY STATED THAT FINAL DECISION AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SELECTIO N OF GDATP’S SUBCONTRACTORS REST SOLELY UPON GDATP AND NOT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. This announcement is being posted for subcontracting opportunities only.

<DESC>NAVAIR Orlando - TSD (Training System Division) in Orlando, FL, is soliciting information from industry regarding sources for the Contractor Instruction, Maintenance, Operation and Training Support (CIMOTS) for the Cargo Offload and Discharge System (COLDS).  The Government intends to use the provided information to aid in defining an acquisition strategy.  Use of other than full and open competition to Day & Zimmerman Services is anticipated, as this is the only known source of maritime services with the unique capabilities and skills to execute these program requirements in a high-risk marine environment.  The government is contemplating a 'Requirements' contract for the acquisition of the COLDS program.  Pending the results of this synopsis, this contract is to be issued under the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 (C) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

The proposed contract is anticipated to be in effect for a period of 5 to 8 years including option periods to be exercised at the discretion of the Government as per FAR 52.217-9.

Requirement Summary
The requirement is to provide CIMOTS/COLDS for the Barge Ferry System at Expeditionary Warfare Training Group, Pacific (EWTGPAC) in San Diego, CA.  This requirement includes instructional, maintenance, operational, and training support to produce a qualified COLDS graduate.  The Contractor will be required to provide students with formal class training on-shore, followed by operation and maintenance training at sea on equipment associated with this program. The COLDS contract also supports worldwide littoral warfare contingencies for the US Navy, Marine Corps, Army, and Air Force.  Presently, the Strategic SEALIFT Program is responsible for three Maritime Propositioning Shipping (MPS) squadrons, one each in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Ocean.  Each MPS squadron has enough strategic logistics to support a 17,000 Marine Expeditionary Brigade for a 30-day contingency.  This strategic war and natural disaster material is comprised of rolling stock, tanks, artillery, food, water, and petroleum products.  This contract is performed on both coasts for the Expeditionary Warfare Training Group Pacific San Diego, CA in actual environments using COLDS equipment.  Therefore, this contract is heavily supported by the actual operating systems and material that moves Logistics Over the Shore (LOTS) for both dry and wet products from ship to shore.  Because this program is mission-driven, frequently 'just-in-time' training is required.  This includes classroom and open sea training.  This training includes instruction for barge ferry pilots, coxswains, roll-on/roll-off discharge facility (RRDF), elevated causeway, and amphibious assault bulk fuels system, just to name a few.  The government-provided equipment used for training as well as real world operations include side-loading warping tugs, conduit training barge, offshore petroleum discharge system, barge ferry simulator, and numerous other equipment.  Emerging COLDS systems are continuously being fielded that require new training, operation, and maintenance.

The target contract award date for COLDS is expected to be made prior to September 2003.

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Ocean Service (NOS),  intends to procure services through the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) for activities in support of the Charleston - Health and Risk Assessment (HERA) of Bottlenose Dolphin Populations Project.  The WHOI is uniquely qualified to perform this work by virtue of its experience and resources.  WHOI scientists possess a unique experience in the biochemical and molecular toxicology of marine mammals.  They have developed methods and reagents for assessing the expression of cytochrome P4501A1 and other biomarkers and applied these in a variety of fish and wildlife species, including marine mammals.  The goals of the Health and Risk Assessment (HERA) of Dolphin Populations Projects are to advance the diagnostic evaluation of dolphin populations and develop predictive models to evaluate conservation and management strategies.  This proposed research will assess environmental and anthropogenic stressors that may affect the health and long-term viability of marine mammal populations.  It will assess changes in gene expression, involving established as well as novel biomarkers, as measures of chemical exposure and effect in bottlenose dolphins sampled from Charleston, South Carolina and the Indian River Lagoon, Florida.    This work will involve assessing Planar halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (PHAHs) and other contaminants on marine organisms.  One approach is through the use of biomarkers.  The tasks involved will include the following: (1) Measure the induction of cytochrome CYP1A1 levels on a set of bottlenose dolphin biopsy samples collection from the Charleston, South Carolina and Indian River Lagoon sites in Fall 2002. Skin/blubber biopsy samples (up to 30 per site) will be analyzed by immunohistochemistry using an antibody specific to mammalian CYP1A1 using methods described in detail.  Staining intensity and occurrence will be scored and a staining index calculated for each sample.  The expression of CYP1A1 in individual animals will be compared to levels of the relevant contaminants as measured by NOS Scientists.  (2) Initiate a pilot study to determine the feasibility of employing the RDA approach to identify novel biomarkers (genes for measuring chemical exposure in skin/blubber biopsies of bottlenose dolphins.   A single skin biopsy (approximately 0.5 g, based on preliminary studies in other cetaceans) wil be divided into two identical subsamples.

<SUBJECT>Sources Sought - Glass Waste Storage Building
<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) Savannah River Operations Office (= SR) is currently in the acquisition planning stage for design and construction=  of a Glass Waste Storage Building.  SR is contemplating setting this procure= ment aside for Certified Small, 8(a) or Hubzone businesses. This acquisition=  is classified as North American Industry Classification (NAIC) #234930, Nuclear Reactor Containment Structure Construction.  The size standard under th= is NAIC is $28.5 million.  The purpose of this ?Sources Sought? announcement is=  to determine the availability of a sufficient number of small businesses (Certified Small, 8(a), or Hubzone) with the experience and expertise t= o perform the effort.  Once the acquisition strategy is finalized, a seco= nd announcement will be issued to inform interested parties of how to rece= ive a copy of the Request for Proposals. Highly radioactive Liquid Waste (HLW) is currently stored in tank farms=  at the Savannah River Site (SRS). The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF)= converts this HLW through vitrification to a less mobile and more stabl= e form of borosilicate glass. The vitrified waste is sealed in stainless steel= canisters and transported to the Glass Waste Storage Building (GWSB) fo= r storage until it can be permanently transferred to the Federal reposito= ry. The DWPF was designed in the mid-1980s.  The original design and regulatory= documentation included provisions for a total of three GWSBs at SRS.  O= nly one GWSB was constructed as part of the original project with two more identical GWSBs to follow at intervals determined from the resultant DWPF product= ion rates. The objective of this project is to construct a second GWSB by 10/06.  = The only anticipated changes to the existing design are modifications necessary = to meet current code requirements and to remove unessential features.  GWSB #2 = will be built adjacent to the existing GWSB where it can receive and retrieve g= lass waste canisters using the existing Shielded Canister Transporter (SCT).= The GWSB #2 should have the same configuration as the existing four vault G= WSB (2286 canister capacity).  No new technologies will be required by this= project. The GWSB is a below-grade structure with a footprint of approximately 2= 10? X 210?.  It consists of four vaults.  The vault walls suspend the grade l= evel floor.  The floor supports the weight of the 235,000-pound SCT and larg= e plugs that provide radiological shielding of the canisters.  The SCT removes = the plugs, inserts the canisters through the openings in the floor, and replaces the plugs. Canisters are expected to radiate 5,000 rem and can generate= 1,000 watts of heat that must be removed by a ventilation system.  An above g= rade superstructure spans the entire width and length of the storage facilit= y with no supporting columns except around the perimeter.  This structure prot= ects the vaults from adverse weather. The GWSB vaults and canister supports are ?safety class? and the vaults=  are also ?safety significant,? as defined by DOE nuclear design requirement= s, to protect the public and facility workers from unacceptable radiation exposure in the event of structurally significant natural phenomena such as tornado= es, earthquakes, etc. A prospective bidder will be required to demonstrate the ability to pro= vide the quality assurance mandated by nuclear industry requirements to assure t= hat safety components can perform their designed purpose.  This will requir= e expertise in nuclear design, construction and construction management. Interested small businesses with the experience and expertise to perfor= m this work are requested to provide SR with a summary of their capabilities, experience and/or expertise in this type of work. In addition, response= s must include a statement of whether they are certified by the Small Business= Administration as a Small Business, 8(a) business, Hubzone, or particip= ants in a Mentor-Prot=E9g=E9 program.  Responses should also include a point of= contact. Responses should be provided within two weeks of publication of this announcement.  This is NOT a Request For Proposals.  SR personnel may contact firms responding to this announcement to clarify a responder?s capabili= ties and other matters as part of this Market Research process.  Responses may b= e submitted electronically to carol.elliott@srs.gov or mailed to U.S. Department of Energy, Savannah River Operations Office, P.O. Box A, Aiken, SC 2980= 2, ATTN: Carol Elliott.
