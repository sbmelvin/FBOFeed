Naval Facilities Engineering Command Far East, Facilities Engineering and Acquisition Division (FEAD), Public Works Department, NAS Joint Reserve Base (JRB), Fort Worth, TX,  is seeking a response from interested firms that qualify as a U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) Certified 8(a), SBA Certified HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), or Economically Disadvantaged Woman Owned Small Business (EDWOSB) with self-performance experience in the types of work likely to be ordered on any potential procurement.
 For more information on the definition or requirements for these, refer to http://www.sba.gov/. All firms are reminded that they must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be eligible to receive any potential contract award.

SCOPE OF WORK:  
The work includes CLN 0001:  This project will replace the existing engine test air compressor along with its filtration system and receiver tanks at the Hush House, Bldg. 4260. Project will also repair the hangar door seals, hangar door exterior surfaces and install a new air compressor for the purpose of separating the door operations from the jet engine testing.
A detailed description of the repairs to the facility is listed as follows:
ENGINE TEST AIR COMPRESSOR
Replace the existing 125 HP test engine air compressor with two UP6-50 200 PSI 50 HP rotary screw compressors.
 The engine test air compressors will have a capacity at 167 SCFM @ 200 PSIG, a low sound enclosure rated for 69 DB(A) and will include an intake dust filter.

Replace the existing filtration system and two receiver tanks associated with the existing engine test air compressor with a new filtration system and new receiving tanks for the new engine test air compressors. Each air compressor will have its own filtration system. The new system filtration for the engine test compressor will consist of 2 phases of filtration. The first phase of filtration (pre-filter) will be a micron coalescing filter. The second phase of filtration will be a membrane air treatment system consisting of 2 membrane modules design for 200 SCFM with a 300 PSIG maximum allowable working pressure, 150 degrees Fahrenheit maximum inlet air temperature and a -40 degrees Fahrenheit pressure dew point suppression.
 The new receiver tanks are 4500 gallon each, horizontally-mounted, carbon steel ASME pressure vessels. The dimensions of the new receiver tanks are 72 in diameter and 288 in length with a maximum operating pressure of 550 PSIG.

Provide concrete supports for the new compressed air tanks and small pads for the air compressors. The tank supports will be supported from the existing concrete slab and will be of a sufficient height to allow the tanks to span across the existing concrete containment wall.

HANGAR DOORS
Replace 10 door safety edges/bumpers on doors according to the original specifications from manufacturer. Replace the 3/8-inch O.D. vinyl pneumatic tubes that run from sensing edge to the control panels inside of the doors.
 Replace all hangar door sill seals. Hangar door sill seals are composed of neoprene foam strips approximately 2 inches by 2 inches square in cross section, which fill the parallel recessed track that the existing hangar doors travel on. Remove existing strips, clean recessed tracks and install new neopreme foam strips. Repair the exterior painting surface of the hangar doors. Hangar doors will be power wash cleaned back to bare metal, primed and re-painted. Repairs also require grinding smooth the concrete pavement where the bottom of the west hangar door currently makes contact.

DOOR SYSTEM AIR COMPRESSOR
Install a new 5 HP reciprocating air compressor with 50-gallon receiver rated for outdoor operations.
 New air compressor will be installed in the existing enclosure and used for hangar door operation only.  The hangar doors have an inflatable door sill seal system that is operated by 30 PSIG compressed air.  Replace the existing air regulator, filters, and solenoid valves in the door equipment enclosure. The new air compressor will also include a modular desiccant dryer. Air system piping will include an isolation valve and will be connected to the existing 4 flange near the existing building penetration at existing stainless steel plate located on the Building 4260 exterior wall. The existing compressed air system header will be modified for use of the dedicated door air compressor or engine test air compressor.
 New control tubing shall be aluminum.

ELECTRICAL 
Project will demolish all circuitry and non-fused disconnect that feeds the existing compressor directly off the transformer. Provide a new NEMA 3R panelboard.

The statutory authority for this acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In accordance with FAR 6.302-1 (b) (1) (ii), only one source is available for this acquisition, to support the detection, location, identification, assessment, and reporting of nuclear detonations through seismic arrays, infrasonic detectors, and hydroacoustic arrays.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The scope of this specific <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">effort </span>is (1) to sustain current US NDC system (24x7 mission system) which includes the operational subsystem, alternate subsystem and training subsystem, (2) to maintain geophysical data acquisition, data processing, reporting and archiving capability for the United States Atomic Energy Detection System (USAEDS) operated by the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC); (3) to acquire data from a global network of seismic, hydroacoustic and infrasonic stations; and (4) to receive, process, archive and report events of interest in monitoring nuclear treaty requirements. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The contractor shall perform highly specialized services to support mission-critical 24x7 operations sustainment of the US NDC, thus preserving essential treaty monitoring functions.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">This justification is based on the Government's requirement for the original provider of the contracted services to perform a continuation of services from contract FA7022-11-C-0006, which is currently in an extension of services under FAR 52.217-8, and, therefore, only one responsible source is capable of satisfying agency requirements in aiding AFTAC/TT in its mission of monitoring nuclear test ban treaties.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The current US NDC software, now 20+ years old, originally was written and now maintained by Leidos, contains over 1.2 million lines of code, is written in nearly a dozen different programming languages, and includes many components that require unique expertise to maintain and support the US NDC mission.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because of the complexity created by how this software has been maintained over the years, awarding to any company other than Leidos would create an unacceptable risk of mission failure. Since AFTAC, at this time is not positioned to completely replace the US NDC software, it has come to the point that the only way another company could successfully provide the critical software support would be to either subcontract with Leidos, or directly hire via incumbent capture the current Leidos employees who understand this complex software system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The inability for any contractor to perform software maintenance on the first day of the contract will severely degrade AFTAC's ability to perform its treaty monitoring mission.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, this acquisition is in direct support of these highly specialized professional services, i.e. experience with and knowledge of a multi-location seismic, infrasonic, and hydroacoustic data acquisition, processing, and analysis system to include hardware and software requirements, research and operational elements.<br /><br />Redacted J&amp;A is Attached.</span></p>
