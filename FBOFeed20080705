<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services intends to negotiate a modification to Contract HHSP23320054304EC with the Boston College Graduate School of Social Work, Boston College Office of Sponsored Programs, 140 Commonwealth Avenue, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467, on a sole source basis under the authority of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) to support the participation of public program (Medicaid and Older American Act) participants in advisory and peer networking and support activities.  The contract modification shall enable ASPE to continue to partner with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in funding a research and technical assistance Center for Consumer-Directed Home and Community-Based Services at Boston College whose purpose is to diffuse the specialized knowledge and expertise about innovative approaches to consumer-directed services gained through the implementation of the original “Cash and Counseling” Demonstration and Evaluation (CCDE) co-sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) and ASPE.  In 2004, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Retirement Research Fund awarded grants to twelve new states to design and implement “cash and counseling” options within their Medicaid programs similar to those previously implemented in Arkansas, New Jersey, and Florida under the original “Cash and Counseling” Demonstration.  Other states have since received or will receive grants from other sources (e.g. the Retirement Research Fund, Centers for Medicare/Medicaid, and the Administration on Aging). In 2008, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation awarded additional grant funding to the Boston College Center for Consumer-Directed Services for the purpose of expanding the current center’s technical assistance activities to states beyond the 15 states which previously received Cash and Counseling grants.  

Therefore, a major requirement for the contractor is expertise and experience with regard to the planning and implementation of “cash and counseling” programs in a variety of state settings.  Boston College has, on staff, the Project Director for the original CCDE and second phase replication effort, who clearly possesses the relevant expertise and experience to direct this effort.  Any other contractor proposing to bid on this contract must demonstrate (1) expertise and experience with respect to the “Cash and Counseling” Demonstration and Evaluation sufficient to provide extensive technical assistance to states replicating the “cash and counseling” innovation in their states and (2) have non-Governmental funds available to support the technical assistance activities equal to the total amount (approximately $4 million) that the Robert Wood Johnson intends to contribute to sustain and further develop the Boston College Center for Consumer Directed Home and Community-Based Home and Community-based Services over the next three years.  The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the requisite qualifications to perform the work described above.  Any organization capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government’s requirement as described above including a specific statement addressing the second factor listed above (source of additional funding).  No solicitation document is available.

<p>(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</p>
<p>(1) * Are, * are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) * Have, * have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) * Are, * are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) * Have, *have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
