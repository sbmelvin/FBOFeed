<DESC>The U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE (MMS), solicits capability statements of not more than twenty (20) pages in length, for specific areas of interest to the Minerals Management Service (MMS) Environmental Sciences Branch.  Additionally, it is not the Government's intention to enter into a contract based on this notice or otherwise pay for information solicited. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 541620, "Environmental Consulting Services". Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the evaluation of the information received.    MMS will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to the subject of this notice. BACKGROUND:     Since 1988, MMS and the oil and gas industry have conducted many meteorological and air quality studies for the Gulf of Mexico.  The data from the various studies differs in quality and quantity, and is not synthesized or integrated.     Neither is the data in a common database format that could be easily analyzed or queried by the MMS or State/Federal air quality groups.  If this data is incorporated into a common database, analysis could be performed to understand basic relationships between meteorology, emissions, and air quality in the Gulf of Mexico. The EPA has promulgated new national ambient air quality standards for ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and regulations for regional haze.  All of these regulations will require States to perform air quality modeling for use in their State Implementation Plans (SIPS).  MMS needs to provide the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and coastal States with a coherent, usable meteorological, air quality dataset and analyses for the Gulf of Mexico. PURPOSE OF PROPOSED STUDY:     The proposed study would generate a dataset of more than ten years of meteorological, air quality, and emissions inventory data, along with air quality analyses for the Gulf of Mexico.     This will be used by MMS in the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process for all Gulf of Mexico air quality issues, and be used by the U.S. EPA and States for required air quality modeling.     Specific objectives of this study are to: (1) synthesize and integrate all meteorological, air quality, and emissions inventory data from MMS, other federal and State agencies, and oil and gas industry related studies accomplished in the Gulf of Mexico since 1988; (2) transform the like data into common formats and assemble in a commonly used data base (MS-Access); (3) evaluate data and flag data quality/limitations; and (4) perform basic analyses, i.e. Classification and Regression Tree Analyses (CART), to determine important relationships between the meteorological, air quality, and emissions variables for the air quality of the affected environments, onshore and at the Breton National Wilderness Area located just offshore of Louisiana and Mississippi.  STUDY PERSONNEL REQUIREMENTS:     Scientific personnel must possess extensive expertise in the knowledge of air quality in the Gulf of Mexico region, oil and gas industry, emissions formatting, meteorological modeling, EPA regulations and emissions submittal procedures, air quality analysis studies, and database management. This expertise must be demonstrated through successful completion of projects comparable to this one, and authorship in peer-reviewed scientific publications.  Specific knowledge required is as follows: MS-Access, Classification and Regression Tree Analyses (CART) or comparable analysis tools, mesoscale meteorological models (i.e. MM5), and emissions inventories and formats (i.e. EPA National Emissions Inventory Input Format or NIF) for air quality models.  INTERESTED PARTIES:     Submit a response with approximately 20-page or less that provides information about the firm's ability to perform all aspects of the effort described above.  Emphasis should be placed on prior experience conducting projects of similar scope and complexity, and publications recorded in peer-reviewed scientific journals.  All proprietary information should be marked accordingly.  Responses will be reviewed by MMS personnel and will be held in a confidential manner. Response due date: not later than close of business, 5 P.M. Eastern Time, 30 May 2006 at the address below:  PROCUREMENT OFFICE ADDRESS FOR SUBMITTAL: NOTE:  It is the Offeror's responsibility to ensure/verify the Government receives their submission on or before the time specified.

MEMORANDUM FOR 21 CONS/LGCBA				8 May 06

FROM:  Network Resource Management, J6248 (Mr. Richard Morales)

SUBJECT:  Sole Source/Brandname Requirement, PR # F3LNHC6123A200,
Upgrade 64-Port Fibre Channel Switch (Portal Upgrade)

1.  This request is for the purchase of equipment under other than competitive procedures as authorized under FAR 13.501.  This sole source/brandname acquisition is for more than $100,000.00 but less than and is requested by NORAD-Northcom (N-NC)/J625 for use in the Trusted Information Exchange (TIE) NIPRNet Portal Project.  The POC for this requirement is Richard Morales at extension 4-4026.  

a.  	Description of Requirement:  
(1)  The equipment to be purchased is an EMC Connectrix ED-48000B Fibre Channel (channel switch), which is a 64-port, director-class fiber channel switch.  EMC is the manufacturer and distributor of this switch.  This sole source/brandname justification is for the purchase of the channel switch from the manufacturer, EMC.  
(2)  The current TIE channel switch is running over an acceptable capacity, and reliability is being compromised.  The channel switch is a critical piece of the TIE system that supports Homeland Defense and Civil Support missions (e.g., hurricane relief assistance and support).  
(3)  EMC has provided all the equipment currently in the switch room (approximately X pieces of equipment), and they provide all the maintenance. The new channel switch to be purchased is the same as the one currently being used.  The salient characteristics of the existing switch are:
-  High availability; high reliability; redundant; hot-pluggable components; non-disruptive upgrades.
-  Hot-swappable components include:  2N redundancy; power supplies; redundant cooling fans; port blades; redundant control processors; and optics.
-  Available rack space:  depth (in/cm) 27.90/70.90 without door; 29.20/74.20 with door; height (in/cm) 24.11/61.24 for 14U; width (in/cm) 17.22/43.74; weight (lb/kg) without media 230/105.
-  Fibre Channel Standards:  FC-PH; FC-PH-2; FC-PH3; FC-GS-2; FC-FLA; FC-FG; FC-SW3.
-  Fibre Channel Ports:  scalable from 2 to 8 port blades in any combination of 16-port or 32-port blades; configuration should start at 32 ports up to 256 ports auto-sensing 1, 2, and 4 Gb/s ports.
-  Cascading with other switches--up to a least 24 switches. 
-  Performance:  full line-speed switching 4.25 Gb/s.
-  Switch Bandwidth and Latency:  2.176 Tb/s end-to-end, less than 2.1 ìsec at 2 Gb/s; less than 3.6 ìsec at 4 Gb/s.
-  Switch Core:  non-blocking design.
-  ISL Trunking:  support for up to 8 4.25-Gb/s ports per ISL trunk; up to 32 Gb/s per ISL trunk, 2 8-port trunk groups on FC4-16; 4 8-port trunk groups on FC4-32 at 2 Gb/s.
-  Classes of Service and Port Types:  Class 2, Class 3, Class F, and E_Port, F_Port, FL_Port.
-  Media Types:  Small Form Factor Pluggable (SFP) laser; LC connector; short-wave laser (SWL) up to 500 meters (1640 feet); long-wave up to 10 kilometers (6.2 miles); long-wave laser to 35-km distance.
-  Fabric Services:  Simple Name Server; Registered State Change Notification (RSCN); Industry Standard Brocade Advanced Zoning; Industry Standard Brocade Web Tools.
-  Other Features:  ISL trunking; fabric watch; performance monitor; extended fabrics. 

b.  	Authority and Reason for Sole Source:
(1)  The authority for this purchase is Purchase Request F3L6123A200, fund cite XXXXXXXXXX; and is estimated to cost $X.  
(2)  FAR 6.302-1(2)(C)(ii) (A) and (B) allows for this situation’s sole source purchase.  It states that a single source may be used if it is considered a follow-on contract for the continued development of a system when the award would result in duplication of cost.  This is true in this case as the purchase of this switch is to upgrade the TIE system.  Also, integrating a different switch with the EMC switches will:
-  Decrease performance, stability and reliability;
-  Require approximately $200K of retraining of Air Force and contractor operators/maintainers;  
-  Would require an additional support and maintenance contract;
-  Would increase the likelihood of downtime;
-  Will increase the risk of compromise of the mission (coming hurricane season (starting 1 June) which depends on the TIE for warning and relief operations).  
	(3)  It is also true that:
-  Maintaining the status quo of high availability and reliability is required for mission support;
-  The EMC switch will provide redundant, hot-pluggable components and a non-disruptive upgrade;
-  Trained AF personnel to maintain it; and 
-  It eliminates the learning curve for system operators/maintainers.  

c.  	Additional Facts:  
(1)  This product and service cannot be purchased from other vendors due to the nature of the reliability and stability required by NORAD/USNorthcom for this application.  High availability is maintained through the stability of keeping single source switching equipment and trained personnel.  This high availability and stability is maintained by 24X7 support from technicians that have been maintaining them since 12/28/2005.  Purchasing a the switch or a different switch from another vendor will introduce variability into an otherwise stable system with the potential to result in a negative impact.  This is not acceptable as the system requires the highest reliability possible to support it’s critical mission of crisis support.  
(2)  The technicians currently supporting the switches are familiar with their workings in our environment, eliminating the learning curve required for any new service provider.  A new service provider will introduce a variable into an otherwise stable environment.  This is not something we want to introduce as we head into hurricane season.  We need this equipment for vital communications with tenant commands for this crisis support.  

d.  Public Notice:  A notice was posted by 21 CONS/LGCBA on FedBizOps, 8-12 May 06 announcing the intention to purchase this equipment as a sole source.    
 
e.  Barriers to Competition:  N-NC is continually evaluating the latest technology.  Technical refresh assessments of equipment and services are conducted at least annually.  A tech refresh means that the market is evaluated for the best equipment to replace the old.  During the most recent tech refresh, EMC was deemed the best provider for equipment and services.  The next technical refresh assessment is scheduled for 2007.  

2.  I certify that this single/sole source request is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology (hereinafter referred to as "technology").  License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement and/or through the Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) program.

Description of invention:  An approach for gettering chromium vapor species from the air stream after its transport through the balance of plant and just prior to entering the SOFC stack. The invention involves utilizing a bed of active materials that can absorb/adsorb the chromium species, thus preventing then from entering the stack where they react with and degrade the cathode.  The getter bed can act as the primary active remover of the chromium species or as a final polisher if coatings are also applied to the balance of plant hardware.   

Significance: The PNNL invention is especially suited to ceramic stacks not having a chromium containing interconnect, and where the chromium species only originate from the balance of plant hardware, and most especially from the heat exchanger given its high surface area.  This invention is most useful for a ceramic stack because an effective gettering system would offer the potential to eliminate nearly all chromium-species prior to the air entering the stack, thus avoiding the cathode chrome poisoning degradation mechanism all together.  The strong temperature dependence of chromium species generation is another factor making this invention more suited to ceramic stacks as they generally operate at 100C-200C higher temperature than metallic interconnect stacks. 

Note: THIS IS NOT PROCUREMENT.  Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company's business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.  Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

<DESC>This is a reiteration of the synopsis that was issued on February 16, 2006 under Reference Number 02-16-06 for Multiple Award IDIQ General Construction contracts to be awarded by NASA's Kennedy Space Center.  NASA’s Kennedy Space Center (KSC) plans to issue a request for proposals resulting in the award of multiple Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) general construction contracts to support construction, alteration, and repair of NASA buildings, structures, and other real property located at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS), and other locations near KSC and CCAFS.	These multiple general construction contracts will provide NASA/KSC the capability to compete selected quick turn-around construction projects amongst a group of highly qualified general construction contractors for a five year period.  Selection of this group of general construction contractors will be based on best value trade-offs between relevant experience/past performance and price factors with relevant experience/past performance being significantly more important than price.  Each IDIQ contract will have a minimum value of $10,000 which represents the minimum value of work the Government is required to order under each IDIQ contract.  The maximum contract value of each IDIQ contract and the maximum value of all IDIQ contracts will be $400 million.   The acquisition process will include the issuance of a DRAFT request for proposal (RFP) inviting comments from potential offerors on all aspects of the DRAFT RFP, including the requirements, schedules, proposal instructions, and evaluation approaches.  The anticipated release date of the DRAFT RFP is not earlier than March 03, 2006. The RFP will include specifications and drawings for a task order envisioned to be awarded to one of the selected IDIQ contractors. The task order will be representative in nature of the tasks to be ordered under the proposed IDIQ general construction contracts.  Offerors will be required to submit a price proposal for the task order as part of its proposal for the IDIQ contracts.  Offerors will be provided a tour of the site where the model task order will be performed. Future task orders will be competed amongst all of the general construction IDIQ contractors unless one of the statutory exceptions in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505(b) (2) applies.  The task order placement process will provide primarily for a “sealed bid” type process where low price wins; however, the task ordering procedures will allow the contracting officer to consider past performance on earlier orders under the contract (including quality and timeliness), past performance on other relevant and recent projects, potential impact on other orders placed with the contractor, and minimum order requirements when making task order award. The performance periods for task orders will vary depending on the scope, urgency of the project, and other applicable factors as determined during the design phase of the projects.  The specific projects to be ordered will be detailed in construction drawings and specifications (unless a design-build project is contemplated in which case a statement of work will be provided) as attachments to task order solicitations.   This acquisition will be conducted under full and open competition procedures allowing maximum participation from large and small businesses. This procurement is part of the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 236220 and the small business size standard is $31 million.  An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". The DRAFT and FINAL solicitations and any documents related to this procurement [with the exception of the specifications and drawings] will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World-Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/KSC Business Opportunities page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=76  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the DRAFT and FINAL solicitations and amendments (if any).	Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Any referenced notes may be viewed at the URLs linked below. All contractual and technical questions must be submitted in writing.  Telephone questions will not be accepted.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT FOR REACTIVE PLASTIC CO2 ABSORBENT PRODUCTION INITIATIVE.  This is a pre-solicitation synopsis which is not a request for competitive proposals.  The work will involve a reactive plastic CO2 (carbon dioxide) absorbent production initiative to expand production capacity, to ensure government product requirements are met, and qualifications are achieved.  The DPA Title III Program Office intends to award a contract or assistance instrument as appropriate, on the basis of other than full and open competition for this requirement to Micropore Inc., 350-F Pencader Drive, Newark, DE 19702.  Under the authority of Title III of the Defense Production Act (DPA) (50 U.S.C. App. Section 2061 et seq.), the Title III Program Office is contemplating this procurement to expand production capacity at a U.S. owned, domestic, merchant reactive plastic CO2 absorbent supplier.  Additionally, qualification work with Government agencies will be required to ensure government product requirements are met.  Reactive Plastic CO2 absorbent material is an innovative improvement over CO2 absorbent granules (end users hand-pack loose granules in a canister) in terms of safety and performance.  Reactive plastic CO2 absorbent is a polymer matrix bond between plastic and CaOH, thus securing the absorbent material.  Benefits of reactive plastic over packing of loose granules include: shock and vibration resistance; cleaner air; more consistent air flow paths; less labored breathing; moister air, more immune to caustic cocktails from water leakage, more consistent dive times, controlled production processes, and quick reload between dives.   Note:  For this program, the offeror must be able to satisfy the requirements of a demonstrated production capacity of at least 50,000 lbs with high utilization and significant marketing/customer sales experience with a reactive plastic CO2 absorbent product.  The period of performance for the procurement is anticipated to be 2-3 years.  A description of key tasks include:  Expand production capacity of reactive plastic CO2 absorbent material and self-contained cartridges, which house the reactive plastic CO2 absorbent material.  Provide a plan for operation efficiency improvements, product enhancements, and quality improvements to meet government user needs.  In order to address economic viability, provide an analysis of the reactive plastic CO2 absorbent marketplace, develop customer product qualification plans, and create a marketing communications program for both Government and commercial applications including, but not limited to scuba, submarines, space and terrestrial shelters. The offerer’s ability to demonstrate production capability of the reactive plastic CO2 absorbent material and to accomplish the goals of this program will be assessed based on the offeror’s demonstrated leadership in this product category and ability to effectively address challenges facing future developments in the rebreathing industry.   The government intends to issue an award for these requirements on a Sole Source basis per FAR 6.302-1(a)(1), “Only One Responsible Source” or “DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations 37.400 (b),” based on the afore-mentioned requirements, as well as an assessment of technical and programmatic risk to the Government.  Offerors who are capable of meeting the requirements stated above shall fully identify their interest and submit, in writing, information documenting their qualifications and capabilities to meet the requirements stated above within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  This documentation shall specify the offeror’s area of expertise and experience.  It shall identify the offeror’s current production capacity and current utilization of reactive plastic CO2 absorbent material, design and packaging details of the marketable product, and the specific applications where the product is currently used.  The documentation shall include a listing of products and services currently offered as a merchant industrial supplier along with market share in each area. The documentation shall identify relevant production experience, and a listing of both commercial and government customers that currently utilize the offeror’s reactive plastic CO2 absorbent product.  Responses received after 15 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis, and will not be considered.  Direct all questions pertaining to this acquisition to the contracting point of contacts listed above in this announcement.    Only one responsible source per capability of interest and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements as per the authority under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  All responsible sources may submit information, which shall be considered by the agency.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

SUMMARY DESCRIPTION:  The Unit ized Group Ration - Express (UGR-E) is a self-contained, self-heating meal module that is intended to support small groups of personnel operating remotely in a field environment, away from food service assets.  This compact heat-in-place module is highly t ransportable (man-portable) and is intended to support air-drop capability.  Each module represents a complete meal, consisting of a main entrée, vegetable, starch, and dessert for up to 18 personnel.  These food vessels are assembled in a primary heating compartment within the UGR-E module to facilitate ease of use and maximize heating efficiency.  Each entrée is coupled with a flameless chemical heater to provide an on-site heat and serve group feeding capability without the need for additional food servi ce personnel, equipment or fuel.  Complementary meal components such as individually packaged snacks (e.g., M&Ms(tm), Skittles(tm), Munch Bars(tm)), Drink-Pack beverages, and 1/8-oz. Tabasco(tm) bottles are also included in the module.  The Drink-Pack pack age, recently introduced to the Meal, Ready-to-Eat (MRE), contains beverage powders and serves as a beverage container, which eliminates the need for additional cups.  All of the necessary food service items, or accessories needed to serve 18 personnel are  also included in the module.  These accessories consist of four serving spoons, which include slotted spoons, as needed for products containing brine, sanitary gloves, and trash bags to maintain traditional Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) f ood safety procedures.  Eighteen sets of individual dining trays and dining packets, which consist of a fork, spoon, knife, napkin, salt, pepper and moist towellettes, are also included in the module. The UGR-E consists of low-cost, disposable components t hat may be readily collected, compacted, and discarded after use.  Consistent with other operational rations, the UGR-E does not require refrigerated storage and has a minimum 18 months of shelf life after assembly. This acquisition will be competed on a F ull and Open basis. A request for proposals (RFP) will be issued on or about 19 May 2006 and will be numbered W911QY-06-R-0008.  The RFP and salient characteristics will be available for download on the RDECOM Acquisition Center website (https://www3.natic k.army.mil) Delivery shall be F.O.B. Destination.

<DESC>NANO-COMPOSITE OPTICAL CERAMICS (NCOC) SOL BAA 06-19, Addendum 3, DUE: 08/03/06.  TECHNICAL POC: Ms Sharon Beermann-Curtin, DARPA, Ph: (571) 218-4935, Email: baa06-19@darpa.mil; URL: www.darpa.mil/dso.  Website Submission: http://www.sainc.com/dso0619.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES, SCOPE AND FUNDING

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) seeks concept white papers and subsequent proposals for innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in material science and processes that result in high performance Nano-Composite Optical Ceramic (NCOC) infrared windows. It is envisioned that the use of new nano-composite materials incorporating improved strength and improved optical properties as well as new innovative processing and shape forming techniques will bring revolutionary operational capabilities at a reduced cost. The NCOC program is interested in developing two technology areas. In technology area one infrared windows with increased performance over sapphire in the 3-5 um regime will be developed. In technology area two infrared windows with improved performance over zinc sulfide in the 3-12 um region will be developed. An offeror may propose in both technology area one or technology area two but must submit a separate proposal for each area. Offerors with novel material concepts but who do not have the facilities needed to produce the required deliverables may submit a white paper for evaluation and before trying to find a teaming partner. Theoretical studies to predict the material grain size required to meet optical scatter requirements may be proposed as part of each technology area effort.

The program is structured into two phases – phase I and phase II – with specific technical goals for each phase in each technology area as noted herein. Satisfactory attainment of the goals for phase I will be one determining factor in the decision to proceed to phase II. The government reserves the right to fund no proposals under this BAA addendum. 

BACKGROUND

Infrared seekers used for the guidance of high velocity missiles require protective domes or windows made from materials which exhibit a combination of good optical properties, such as high transmittance at useful wavelengths (3-5 and 8-12 um), and excellent mechanical and thermal properties, such as high strength (at operational temperatures) and thermal shock resistance. The most durable current material for midwave (3-5 um) infrared seekers is sapphire. While sapphire is an excellent material, it suffers from a number of deficiencies in both optical and mechanical properties that limit the range of applications where it can be used. For example, while transmittance is good across the entire 3-5 um band, emissivity at elevated temperatures experienced in flight impose a practical limit of 3-4 um. Moreover, sapphire is opaque in the long wave (8-12 um) range. Mechanically, sapphire suffers an extreme loss of c-axis compressive strength with increasing temperature, with only 5 percent of its room temperature value remaining at 600 degrees C. Another problem with sapphire is that the single crystal nature of the material limits the size and shape of the dome that can be achieved at reasonable cost. Large windows or aerodynamic dome shapes are prohibitively expensive.  

Some of these problems can be largely mitigated by utilizing polycrystalline materials in place of sapphire (single crystal Al2O3). Such ceramic domes will not experience drastic degradation of mechanical properties at elevated temperature (500-1000 degrees C). A ceramic (polycrystalline) dome with large dimensions and/or aerodynamic shape can be fabricated to near net shape eliminating some of the costly grinding. Moreover, the aerodynamic shape reduces the thermal load on the dome and mitigates the effects of particle impact.

Achieving required optical properties from a polycrystalline material places severe limitations on grain size. Non-cubic single phase materials must have sub-micron grains (typically 300-400 nm or less), while composite materials will need a grain size that is an order of magnitude smaller. The actual required microstructure will depend on the indexes of refraction of the constituent phases. The fabrication of fully dense, optically transparent ceramic nano-composites will challenge the current state of the art in ceramic processing.

The use of aerodynamic nano-composite domes alone will not address the usable transmission range of sapphire. Increasing the range of usable wavelengths for midwave infrared windows from 4 um to 5 um will require the use of a material which does not contain a large fraction of Al2O3. Current long wave infrared materials (e.g. ZnS) have poor mechanical properties. This mechanical deficiency may be mitigated by the development of nano-composites with superior strength and toughness. Fabrication of a 3-12 um dome material with mechanical properties similar to those of sapphire will be extremely challenging.  

DESCRIPTION  

I. Technology Area One:  Develop a material and processes required to make infrared windows and aerodynamically shaped domes with optical and mechanical capabilities that exceed those of single crystal sapphire for midwave infrared (3-5 um) operation. Phase I goals are to achieve midwave infrared optical transmission comparable to that of spinel with mechanical properties comparable to those of sapphire. Phase II goals are to decrease optical scatter and to increase mechanical and thermal shock capabilities to exceed those of sapphire. Phase I deliverables will be polished disks. Phase II deliverables will be polished disks, polished hemispheric domes, and polished aerodynamically shaped domes.

Deliverables:

Phase I:	Ten 75-mm-diameter times 2-mm-thick optically polished disks
Phase II:	Ten 75-mm-diameter times 2-mm-thick optically polished disks
	Five 75-mm-diameter times 2-mm-thick optically polished hemispheric domes.  
	Three optically polished tangent ogive shape domes. Geometry and dimensions will be determined by mutual agreement with the Government.  Nose tip will be cut off.  
Example 1:  127 mm diameter times 190 mm height times 4 mm thick
Example 2:  75 mm diameter times 112 mm height times 2 mm thick

H) Single drop impact of 3 mm diameter water drop on 3 mm thick times 19 mm diameter disk at normal incidence at Marshall Space Flight Center test facility

II. Technology Area Two:  Develop a material and processes required to make infrared windows and aerodynamically shaped domes with low absorption and low scatter in the 3-12 um wavelength region, but with much greater mechanical and thermal shock capabilities than those of standard grade zinc sulfide. The material must maintain its low optical absorption up to at least 600 degrees C. Thermal shock resistance should be twice as great as that of standard zinc sulfide. Sand erosion resistance should be at least as great as that of polycrystalline spinel.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION AND DEADLINES

Proposals may be submitted and received at any time until the final proposal deadline of 4:00 PM ET Thursday, August 3, 2006. Proposals will be evaluated against the criteria set forth in this solicitation, and the proposer will be notified either that: (1) the proposal has been selected for funding, or (2) the proposal has not been selected for funding. Proposers may elect to have their proposal withdrawn from consideration at any time during the evaluation process. If a formal request is not made, DARPA will assume that continued evaluation is desired. One copy of each proposal that is not selected for funding will be retained for administrative purposes.

The government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement. The government also reserves the right to fund proposals in phases with options for continued work at the end of one or more of the phases. Proposals identified for funding may result in a procurement contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or "Other Transaction," depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors. The proposer must submit a separate list of all technical data or computer software that will be furnished to the Government with other than unlimited rights (see DFARS Part 227).

OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION

Teaming and Team Composition
Teaming is encouraged, especially when interdisciplinary approaches to a problem are required.  Proposals may include, or be led by, foreign firms and/or personnel provided all export control laws and U.S. national security requirements are adhered to in the conduct of the effort and that the work relating to the foreign firm or personnel is unclassified. The onus of understanding and complying with export control rests with the proposer, not the government.

Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals. However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for Small Disadvantaged Businesses, HBCU, and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities. 

Awards made under this BAA are subject to the provisions of the FAR Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflicts of Interest. Consequently, all proposers and proposed subcontractors must, therefore, affirm whether they are providing scientific, engineering and technical assistance (SETA) or similar support to any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract. All affirmations must state which office(s) the proposer supports, and identify the prime contract numbers. Affirmations should be furnished at the time of proposal submission. All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined at FAR 9.501, must be disclosed. The disclosure shall include a description of the action the proposer has taken or proposes to take to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict.

Technology Transition
Proposals that have currently identifiable commercial or military end-product are strongly encouraged to engage commercial and military end-users and commercial manufacturers. The engagement of these communities also helps ensure that the various technologies being developed will be commercially viable (cost effective, manufacturability, etc.) and available to the military. Thus, proposals are strongly encouraged to include/involve the user-community that intends to bring the technology to practice as a result of this research. This relationship encourages the participation of researchers, end-users and manufacturers as collective contributors to the technology definition, implementation, and performance evaluation.

Proprietary Information
All proprietary information should be marked on both the white paper and the full proposal. It is the policy of DARPA to treat all proposals as competitive information and to disclose their contents only for the purpose of evaluation. Standard proprietary disclaimers notwithstanding, proposals may be reviewed by non-Government technical experts who have signed a nondisclosure agreement with DARPA, unless the specific phrase TO BE REVIEWED BY GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES ONLY appears on the cover sheet. In any case, personnel under exclusive contract with DARPA who have completed the appropriate nondisclosure agreements will handle the proposals for administrative purposes. 

Guidance for Classified Information and Data
The Government anticipates that proposals submitted under a BAA will be unclassified. In the event that a proposer chooses to submit a classified proposal, the following information is applicable.
Proposals and white papers may contain classified information or data (up to the level of Top Secret/SCI). HOWEVER, DO NOT SEND CLASSIFIED WHITE PAPERS OR FULL PROPOSALS BY EMAIL OR VIA ONLINE SUBMISSION SYSTEMS. Proposers that intend to include classified information or data in their proposals should contact DARPA security at (571) 218-4842 (or alternatively, the point-of-contact for this BAA) for guidance and direction in advance of proposal preparation. Proposers must have existing approved capabilities (personnel and facilities) to perform research and development at the classification level they propose. Security Classification guidance on DD Form 254 will not be provided at this time since DARPA is soliciting ideas only. After reviewing the incoming proposals, if a determination is made that the award instrument may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued and attached as part of the award. Proposers choosing to submit a classified proposal must first receive permission from the Original Classification Authority to use their information in applying to this BAA. An applicable classification guide should be submitted to ensure that the proposal is protected appropriately. For instructions on submitting Classified White Papers or Full Proposals, contact Security & Intelligence Directorate (SID) Classification Management at (571) 218-4842.

Research Involving Human Use
Proposals selected for funding are required to comply with provisions of the Common Rule (32 CFR 219) on the protection of human subjects in research (http://www.dtic.mil/biosys/downloads/32cfr219.pdf) and the DoD Directive 3216.2 (http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html2/d32162x.htm). All proposals that involve the use of human subjects are required to include documentation of their ability to follow Federal guidelines for the protection of human subjects. This includes, but is not limited to, protocol approval mechanisms, approved Institutional Review Boards (IRB), and Federal Wide Assurances. These requirements are based on expected human use issues sometime during the entire length of the proposed effort.
For proposals involving greater than minimal risk to human subjects within the first year of the project, performers must provide evidence of protocol submission to a federally approved IRB at the time of final proposal submission to DARPA. For proposals that are forecasted to involve greater than minimal risk after the first year, a discussion on how and when the proposer will comply with submission to a federally approved IRB needs to be provided in the submission. More information on applicable Federal regulations can be found at the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Human Research Protections website (http://www.dhhs.gov/ohrp/).

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the supplies and services described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above within fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of this synopsis. Salient characteristics:  The U.S. Geological Survey has an ongoing requirement for implementing the Memorandum of Understanding executed in 1991 between the University of Memphis and the U.S. Geological Survey for earthquake research and hazard mitigation. USGS scientists and scientists at the University of Memphis work in conjunction at the University of Memphis Center for Earthquake Research and Information (CERI).  The CERI has a longstanding research program concerning the earthquake hazards in that seismically active part of the United States. Requirement is for office space on-site at the University of Memphis, as well as a graduate research assistant, some office support, computer network access with CERI, and other miscellaneous services, including mail and copying services and a dedicated fax line.  The space needs to be located on-site in order to perform collaborative research and collaborative outreach activities, conduct co-operative seismological studies, interpret seismic data, records and documentation archived at the University, and to be able to attend meetings and conferences held on campus, often with no prior notice.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the supplies and services specified as a sole source from the University of Memphis Center for Earthquake Research and Information, Memphis, Tennessee, 38152, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required supplies and services, or the functional equivalent (based upon the criteria specified herein), are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement. THIS ANNOUCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY; no formal RFQ will be available.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory has a mandate to remove chromium - a toxic material - from its maintenance, repair and overhaul operations.  Aircraft returning for planned depot maintenance may require some or all of the coating system to be removed during inspections.  The aircraft subsequently must then be touched up or recoated.  This involves the use of one or all of the following coating system components; a chromated chemical conversion coating as a pretreatment, a chromated primer, or a topcoat.  To help meet its environmental compliance goals, the Air Force requires totally chromium-free coating (pretreatment, primer and topcoat) systems for the outer mold line surfaces of aircraft.  The Air Force has tested and characterized one such coating system and is seeking additional totally chromium-free coating systems.

The requirements for a commercially available, off the shelf, totally chromium-free coating system are provided below.  Vendors that can supply such a system in production batches are invited to send written information and performance data to the person listed below.  This information should contain, as a minimum: (i) product descriptions, including proof that no chromium compounds are present in any of the system components; (ii) Material Data Safety Sheets; (iii) supporting performance test data validated by an independent, certified laboratory, and (iv) examples of its current use on commercial and/or military aircraft.

This request for information is not a solicitation for a capability statement, nor a solicitation for a proposal to procure, apply and evaluate such coatings.  The Air Force may use the information received to determine if there are qualified sources and products that would warrant a subsequent full and open competition for coating system evaluation, demonstration and qualification.   Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary.  The Government will not reimburse the respondents for any costs associated with their responses.  The Government reserves the right to contact the submitting parties, on an as required basis, for further clarification on material provided.

CHROMIUM-FREE COATING SYSTEM MATERIALS AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

1.0	Scope

This request for information is based on the draft SAE specification for a Type 2 Advanced Performance Coating System, which specifies that no system component shall contain chromium.

2.0	Coating, Physical Properties
2.1	Surface Appearance:  The system components shall be applied initially after mixing and any induction period as defined by the manufacturer’s instructions, and after 4 hours pot life, to horizontally and vertically mounted test panels and air dried for no less than 24 hours.  The finish shall exhibit a uniform, smooth surface, free from runs, sags, bubbles, streaks, hazing, seeding, dusting, floating, mottling, or other defects.
2.2	Color:  The coating system shall match the applicable color standard in Federal Color Standard 595B with a color difference (&#61508;E) less than or equal to 1.0 when tested in accordance with ASTM D 2244.
2.3	Infra Red Reflectance (Fed Std 595, color number 34095 only):  The total infrared reflectance (specular and diffuse) of the coating system shall be a maximum of 8 when tested relative to barium sulfate in the wavelength range of 700 to 2,600 nanometers (nm) with a Perkin-Elmer LAMBDA 9 spectrophotometer or equivalent (as determined by ASTM E 275).
2.4	Gloss:  When tested according to ASTM D 523, the specular gloss of the system shall be as follows:
Camouflage Colors	85° angle of incidence	9 maximum
	60° angle of incidence	5 maximum
Gunship	85° angle of incidence	3 maximum
	60° angle of incidence	3 maximum
Semi-gloss Colors	60° angle of incidence	15 minimum, 45 maximum
Gloss Colors	60° angle of incidence	90 minimum
2.5	Adhesion:  When tested according to Method 6301, Federal Standard 141C (wet tape test), no component of the system shall peel or delaminate from the substrate or any other component of the system.
2.6	Ambient Temperature Flexibility:  Test panels, prepared with the coating system, shall be tested per MIL-PRF-85285C, paragraph 4.6.3.1.  The coating shall exhibit no cracking or adhesion loss at 40 percent elongation.  The primer alone shall exhibit a minimum impact elongation of 60%.
2.7	Low-temperature Flexibility:  Test panels, prepared with the coating system, shall be tested in accordance with ASTM D 522, Method B, at ­51°±3°C (­60°±5°F), using a 1.0 inch mandrel for gloss and semi-gloss colors and a 2.0 inch mandrel for camouflage colors.  The coating shall exhibit no cracking after testing, when examined with the unaided eye.
3.0	Coating, Resistance Properties
3.1	Neutral Salt Spray Corrosion Resistance:  Test panels coated with the complete coating system shall be scribed, through the coating to the substrate, and placed in a 5 percent salt spray cabinet for 2,000 hours as described in ASTM B 117.  The panels shall not exhibit blistering or lifting of any coating components and shall exhibit no substrate (pitting) corrosion.
3.2	Filiform Corrosion Resistance:  Scribed test panels shall be placed vertically in a desiccator containing 12 Normal (N) HCl for one hour at 24°±3°C (75°±5°F).  Within five minutes of removal from the desiccator, the test panels shall be placed in a desiccator maintained at 40°±2°C (104°±3°F) and relative humidity (RH) 80±5 percent for 1,000 hours.  Upon removal, the test panels shall not exhibit filiform corrosion extending beyond 0.25 inch from the scribe, and the majority of the filaments shall be less than 0.125 inch in length.
3.3	Fluid Resistance:  The coating, applied to test panels, shall withstand immersion as follows:

Fluid	Fluid Temperature	Immersion Time (min.)
MIL-L-23699F	121°±3°C (250°±5°F)	24 hours

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory has a mandate to remove chromium - a toxic material - from its maintenance, repair and overhaul operations.  Aircraft returning for planned depot maintenance may require some or all of the coating system to be removed during inspections.  The aircraft subsequently must then be touched up or recoated.  This involves the use of one or all of the following coating system components; a chromated chemical conversion coating as a pretreatment, a chromated primer, or a topcoat.  To help meet its environmental compliance goals, the Air Force requires totally chromium-free coating (pretreatment, primer and topcoat) systems for the outer mold line surfaces of aircraft.  The Air Force has tested and characterized one such coating system and is seeking additional totally chromium-free coating systems.

The requirements for a commercially available, off the shelf, totally chromium-free coating system are provided below.  Vendors that can supply such a system in production batches are invited to send written information and performance data to the person listed below.  This information should contain, as a minimum: (i) product descriptions, including proof that no chromium compounds are present in any of the system components; (ii) Material Data Safety Sheets; (iii) supporting performance test data validated by an independent, certified laboratory, and (iv) examples of its current use on commercial and/or military aircraft.

This request for information is not a solicitation for a capability statement, nor a solicitation for a proposal to procure, apply and evaluate such coatings.  The Air Force may use the information received to determine if there are qualified sources and products that would warrant a subsequent full and open competition for coating system evaluation, demonstration and qualification.   Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary.  The Government will not reimburse the respondents for any costs associated with their responses.  The Government reserves the right to contact the submitting parties, on an as required basis, for further clarification on material provided.

All sources of any type of rifle capable of firing the required projectiles at a muzzle velocity of no less than 2500 feet per second please respond.  The Government is interested in ultimately attaining a rifle that can be made operable with the older but available 20 X 110 MM M90 and M200 series ammunition types which have been used in M3, M24A1, and MK16 guns.  The M90 series ammunition uses M36A1 (MK 31) percussion primers, 490 grains of IMR-4879 propellant to fire 1890 and 2030 grain projectiles.  The M200 series uses M36A1E1 percussion primers and IMR 7013 or WC 875 propellant.  Weapons with designs requiring significant modification for use of this ammunition type would be considered, however, design changes should be noted.  A man portable prone shoulder fired weapon is desired. Rifle action can be single shot of any type, magazine fed, bolt action or semi!   – automatic. Light system weight is a goal.  Vendors please provide price and availability information on weapons.  Test quantities of government ammunition (M99 or M204 TP rounds) may be made available to companies that the government believes to have potential to meet this desired capability.  Respondents are requested to provide pricing and availability information to include any discounts based on quantity.  A respondent to this market survey should have available a majority of the skills and facilities that are required to manufacture the rifle. If a respondent does not have adequate resources (technical, manufacturing, personnel, etc.) available, the respondent must be able to demonstrate the ability to obtain those resources in a timely fashion.  Interested companies who feel they possess the necessary capabilities should respond by providing the Government the following information: point of contact, address, telephone and fax numbers, email addresses, duns number, cage code and/or tax ID number, size category (large/small, disadvantaged, etc.), location (domestic or foreign), a brief summary of the company’s capabilities, description of facilities, personnel, related manufacturing experience, and existing safety approvals.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. BASED ON CAPABILITY STATEMENTS RECEIVED FROM THIS SOURCES SOUGHT THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE OR AS FULL AND OPEN. ALL SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, and SDVOSB) ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE.  SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS MUST HAVE THEIR SIZE STATUS CERTIFIED BY THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION.  THE NAICS CODE IS 541710 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES.   

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious diseases.  The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), supports a comprehensive extramural research program focused on the prevention and control of diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents (with the exception of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus).  This includes basic research, such as studies of microbial biology and physiology; applied research, including the development of vaccines, therapeutics and medical diagnostics; as well as clinical studies to evaluate experimental drugs and vaccines.

Recent threats of the use of infectious agents as biological weapons have generated increased concern for the safety of the general American populace.  Bacillus anthracis (B. anthracis) is the etiologic agent of anthrax.  The ability to generate high titer anthrax spores using basic microbiological techniques combined with the ability of these agents to be disseminated by aerosolization, has made anthrax a primary bioterrorist and military threat.  With the deliberate exposure of citizens of the United States to B. anthracis spores in 2001, there is an urgent need to stockpile appropriate and effective medical countermeasures to protect all U.S. citizens from the morbidity and mortality associated with infection from these instruments of terror.  

The NIAID is seeking capability statements from sources that are capable of advanced development and testing of anthrax vaccine candidates which build upon the second generation vaccine, and have properties desirable for a biodefense vaccine to be stored in the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS).  These properties include long-term stability (i.e., three years or longer) at room temperature, the ability to generate a protective immune response in one or two doses, and the ability to be safely self-administered and/or rapidly inoculated into large numbers of people.  Anthrax vaccine candidates eligible for support under this solicitation shall possess all or some of these properties while maintaining a superior safety profile to the currently U.S. licensed anthrax vaccine.  Novel formulations/final vaccine presentation, new delivery platforms, adjuvants other than aluminum, and inclusion of antigens in addition to protective antigen (PA) may be components of candidate vaccines.

The project involves:  (1) manufacture and testing of anthrax vaccine candidates possessing some/all of the characteristics described above; (2) production of vaccine components and final product at pilot-lot scale; (3) characterization and testing including a stability program; (4) one or more pre-clinical safety studies required for the filing of an Investigational New Drug application (IND); (5) non-clinical aerosol spore challenge studies using rabbit and non-human primate models; (6) one option for the design and conduct of a Phase 1 dose escalating clinical trial in healthy subjects ages 18 to 40; and (7) one option for up to two Phase 2 clinical trials in healthy subjects ages 18 to 55.  If a novel device for vaccine delivery is proposed, contract funds may be utilized to suitably formulate the candidate vaccine for the device; however, funds may not be used for developing a device. This RFP will require that a Premarket Approval Application (PMA) or a Premarket Notification Form 510K must be currently filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for such devices and documentation provided in the Technical Proposal. 

Capability statements submitted in response to this notice will be evaluated in accordance with  each organizations demonstrated and documented capabilities as follows:  (1) documentation that the proposed anthrax vaccine candidate has a  purified Protective antigen (PA) that has been shown to be efficacious against B. anthracis spore challenge in animal models, the proposed vaccine must contain a PA component.  The PA component may be proteinaceous or nucleotide-encoded; (2) documentation supporting the vaccine candidates development status relating to established Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) pilot-scale production of a clinical grade material suitable for use in Phase 1/2 clinical trials; (3) justification for further development of the proposed candidate vaccine as it relates to the objectives of this RFP (improved safety profile, rapid and robust titers in no more than two doses, elimination of cold chain/long-term stability, and ease of delivery for use in an emergency event) is warranted, while maintaining an improved safety/reactogenicity profile over the current licensed vaccine and at least equivalent efficacy; (4) demonstration of the availability and adequacy of facilities for cGMP drug substance (DS) and cGMP final drug product (FDP) manufacturing at pilot-lot manufacturing scale. For this effort, pilot-scale DS fermentation is defined as a minimum of 30 liter working volume and/or sufficient DS to fill 2,000 doses of FDP. FDP is defined as a minimum of 2,000 final doses per single lot run. Potential sources proposing methodology for DS production other than fermentation must provide documentation to indicate that current yield is of equivalent quantity as above requirements.  Pilot-lot scale processes must be readily transferable to large scale manufacture; (5) documentation of previous experience in developing and conducting non-clinical development plans to evaluate safety and efficacy of vaccine candidates that includes the conduct of all FDA required Investigational New Drug application (IND) enabling studies; and (6) documentation of previous experience in developing and executing clinical development plans to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of vaccine candidates.

It is estimated that the provision of FTEs will be approximately as follows:  13 FTE for Base Year 1 & 2; Reduced to 7.55 FTEs for Base Year 3; 2.1 FTEs for Year 3--Option 1; 2.1 FTEs for each Option 2—Years 4-7.  The Option periods could increase the contract value and extend the contract by up to four years.  Interested organizations should submit two copies of their capability statement addressing each of the areas cited above. Any proprietary information should be so marked.  Interested organizations presenting a capability statement in response to this sources sought announcement must identify their size status (i.e. educational institution, non-profit, large business, small business, 8(a), or other corporate or non-corporate entity).  Written capability statements should be received by the Contracting Officer by May 23, 2006.   Please reference the solicitation number on all related correspondence.  No collect calls will be accepted. Facsimile and e-mail transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 25.

<DESC>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is seeking contractors interested in providing a full range of Information Technology Business Analysis and Management Support Services.  The services to be provided are more fully described in this “sources sought” notice.

This is not a request for competitive proposals.  This notice is issued as part of FDIC’s market research to identify potential sources with relevant experience and capabilities.  FDIC intends to review the responses received to this notice to assist us in developing a list of prospective offerors for a possible future solicitation.  Interested sources will be required to submit information describing their experience and capabilities and other information as stated in this notice.  The FDIC reserves the right, in its sole discretion and judgment, to determine if a solicitation will be made and which sources are included in any future solicitation list.

BACKGROUND – The FDIC is the independent deposit insurance agency created by Congress to maintain stability and public confidence in the nation’s banking system.  The Division of Information Technology (DIT) is the lead information technology organization within the FDIC and has sole responsibility for information technology (IT) service delivery for the entire corporation.  DIT was established to develop and maintain an applied information technology program responsive to corporate business needs and strategies.

SCOPE – There are three primary functions where FDIC may seek contractor services.   1: To obtain IT services to support the Business Analysis Sections in conducting inception and elaboration phase tasks in the management of the FDIC’s Division of Information Technology (DIT) applications portfolio.  
2:  To obtain management support services for the Business Administration Branch in monitoring the activities of the FDIC Information Technology Application Support (ITAS) contractors.  (The FDIC competitively awarded contracts to four firms in 2005 to provide all IT application support related services.)
3:  To provide support for the independent testing program employed by DIT for all new and existing applications.  The standard system development methodology in use at the FDIC is the Rational Unified Process (RUP).  As appropriate, contractors would use the RUP processes, as modified by the FDIC, in providing support to these three functional areas.  In addition, FDIC is interested in sources possessing a Capability Maturity Model (CMM) Level 3 rating. 

Delivery Management Branch - Business Analysis (BA) Support  
The mission of BA is to work with DIT clients to conduct business process reviews, develop business cases, develop and document high-level requirements, provide technical alternatives, ensure solutions are compatible with the enterprise architecture, develop cost estimates and project work plans.

The selected contractor would provide the full range of business analysis support for new projects/initiatives and large enhancement development efforts to existing systems required in support of FDIC’s mission.   More specifically these tasks would directly support FDIC’s RUP activities initiated or completed in the inception and elaboration phase and produce applicable deliverables or artifacts as directed by BA.  
Support of the BA Sections includes the following:

•	Conduct inception and elaboration activities and deliver artifacts as defined in the RUP, as modified by the FDIC.
•	Make recommendations for improving business analysis processes and functions conducted in the BA Sections.  Ensure that a well-defined process is established and followed for various types of projects and sizes.
•	Make recommendations for improving the cost estimating processes conducted in the BA Sections.  

The contractor will be required to conform to the RUP, as modified, by the FDIC and other DIT standards.  It is expected that gate reviews will be performed for key activities and major milestones.  It is expected that the contractor will use the Rational tools and StarTeam, the FDIC standard configuration management tool, in supporting the business analysis activities.

Business Administration Branch (BAB) Management Support
The mission of the BAB is to establish and maintain efficient and effective business processes to support the delivery of IT to the Corporation.  It accomplishes its mission utilizing industry best business practices and corporate policies to ensure establishment of comprehensive IT policies, implement program management oversight,  review and optimize internal operating procedures, manage the IT internal control and audit coordination programs, provide financial management services, establish contract sourcing strategies, manage vendor relationships, and carries out administrative management initiatives in accordance with divisional management needs.  

The Contractor would provide the full range of IT services and management expertise, and solution-related products in this functional category to meet the mission needs of DIT.  This section of the tasks would satisfy the full range of IT management-related requirements. With the pace of change in the IT industry, it is impossible to anticipate how IT requirements and individual programs will evolve over the life of the contract. It is intended that a contractor remain current and continue to provide the full range of IT capabilities/solutions and emerging technologies throughout the term of a contract, if awarded. 

Independent Testing Program
The mission of the Independent Testing Section is to provide policy and procedures for applications testing including planning, case and script development, execution, result documentation, client coordination, pilot implementations, test tool management and test result reporting including system qualification testing, system integration testing, user acceptance testing and stress testing.

If the answer is yes, the contractor shall ask if the patient, or the patient’s sponsor, is on flying status.  The contractor shall ask the medical reason (symptom) for the call.  All patient medical symptoms shall be provided to the on-call provider.  For all symptom-based calls, the contractor shall document the patient’s or sponsor’s flying status or non-flying status, name, age, social security number, chief symptom(s), and a phone number where the patient can be reached.  For anything other than medical symptoms, such as medical prescription refill requests or appointment requests, the contractor shall advise the caller to call the MDG’s appointment and information line, during normal duty hours of 7:30 a.m. – 4:30 p.m., at 228-2778 (Attachment A).

Questions and Answers on Solicitation HSCG23-06-R-DNQ140B

Question:

What is the total quantity of MLB platforms? The solicitation states the government will order at least half of the boat set for the MLB

Answer:

There are 117 Motor Lifeboats in our inventory.   

Question:

In the Amendment on page 3 in the next to last paragraph it says "This control shall be combined into the same unit as that for 3.9.4. Please clarify what "3.9.4" is.

Answer:

The portable/remote unit shall be equipped with a momentary PTT switch to allow the operator to activate the microphone when the microphone mute function is activated.     This control shall be readily accessible, such that there is no need for the operator to access the pocket of the survival vest to activate the PTT switch. “

Question:

Please define "off the shelf product".

Answer:

Please see FAR Part 2.101 for the definition of a commercial item.

Question:

Is there a location on the internet where the appropriate paperwork can be downloaded or can it be faxed emailed or mailed?

Answer:

Please see the direction in the solicitation for submission of your proposal

Question:

Are all five crewmembers completely wireless or are any tethered with cables?   

Answer:

The specified Crew Communication System (CCS) should be a completely wireless system.  The tether connects the coxswain position to the VHF-FM radios at the steering stations.

Question:

Is the coxswain one of the five wireless or is this headset hard-wired (with break-away connectors) into the intercom?  

Answer:

The coxswain shall have the same wireless crew communications system as the other four crew members but also have the capability to connect to the VHF-FM radios via a break free tether.

Question:

How is the radio select (between the 2 identified radios) accomplished? 
        Location? 
        Method?

Answer:
We expect the vendor to provide the solution.

Question:
Can you provide clarification for the Steering Station? What is the steering station? 
Answer:

The 47FT MLB has four steering stations—two each on the open bridge and enclosed bridge.  Steering Stations are the location on the MLB from which we steer the boat.

Question:

If the steering station needs a breakaway connector and length of the cable connection shall be sufficient to allow the operator to use either steering station on the open bridge, how is it wireless?

Answer:

The breakaway tether is only intended for VHF-FM radio connectivity.  The crew communications system is wireless.
Question:
Are all references to the steering station in the open bridge? 
Answer:
No.  The 47ft MLB has two steering stations on the open bridge and two in the enclosed bridge
Question:
Are any handheld radios used in the configuration?  
Answer:

No.
Question:
Is the 120VAC charger off the vessel?  It seems to have no environmental constraints thus must not be on the vessel. 
Answer:

The 120VAC charger is for off vessel use only. 

THE DEADLINE FOR ALL QUESTIONS PERTAINING TO THIS SOLICIATION IS COB 17 MAY 2006.

As used in this clause: Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears.

Offers may be submitted on company letterhead stationery indicating the National Stock Number, Nomenclature, Part Number and Unit Price.   NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.   It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.   The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.     Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.   Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.   To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).   Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
