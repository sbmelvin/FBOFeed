<DESC>The FDA intends to award Sole Source procurement to SPOTFIRE INC., 212ELM Street, Suite 2, Somerville, MA 02144-2959. Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  An award will be made seven (7) calendar days from the date of this notice.

JUSTIFICATION FOR SOLE SOURCE:  Sole-Source Justification for Spotfire Licenses

Spotfire, and it?s statistical and genomics analysis packages, have been used by CFSAN?s laboratory as well as CDER laboratory for the past 2 years.  Spotfire allows us to analyze massive amounts of genomics data generated by our laboratories.  The more ?common? applications such as Microsoft Access and Microsoft Excel are not capable of handling massive data sets due to their restrictions on ~65,000 rows of data per table. It is often necessary to analyze hundreds of thousands of rows of data in a typical micro array experiment.

The laboratories have integrated Spotfire?s analysis and visualization capabilities into the development of our research programs.  If another source is considered and the Spotfire Analysis Files are proprietary, CFSAN would have the added delays and expenses of a conversion process.  A conversion process would require a Spotfire representative present to protect their software, additional costs, and a loss of work in an environment where the FDA is required to accept and re-analyze data from outside companies who seek new food and drug approvals on a daily basis.

The genomics data currently stored would have to be converted to that we have generated over the past 2 years is stored in a proprietary Spotfire Analysis File (.sfs) format that can only be read by Spotfire.  These file formats allow for data storage in addition to analysis results and visualization windows that prevent us from have to ?re-analyze? the same data.

NO REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source simplified acquisition under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b) to CoCreate Software, Inc. of Fort Collins, CO 80525-5735. This acquisition is for an engineering database conversion at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Center for Neutron Research (NCNR). This procurement will address the need for planning and executing the conversion of the current NIST NCNR engineering database. The existing engineering system is an Oracle database with a CoCreate Model Manager user interface. The new converted implementation will be a Microsoft SQL Server database with a CoCreate Model Manager user interface. 
CoCreate is the only contractor with the intimate knowledge of the current NCNR database customizations as well as the database software from which this conversion will be made from as well as made to which is necessary to complete this task reliably. An incomplete or under customized NCNR database would result in a loss of years of instrument and facility computer models and drawings as well as important part attributes such as descriptions, material, supplier, and part numbers. CoCreate has developed proprietary tools in order to complete database conversions of this type and has gained intimate knowledge of the current NCNR database from support they have provided. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all proposals received on or before September 11, 2007, will be considered by the Government. No RFQ package is available. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<SUBJECT>71 -- Questions and Answers
<DESC>Questions and Answers for F3UUAA7232A300


1)	Question: There is a difference between chairs and pews.  The word pew implies to me a bench capable of holding two or more persons whereas a chair implies a single seat.  Is this a chair or a bench?  If it is a bench, how long is it to be?
Answer: We are soliciting for chairs not pews.  These need to be for individual seating.
2)	Question: This color sounds very specific.  Do you have a specific make and model in mind?  If not, is "Fresh Huckleberry" Blue?  Huckleberries I'm familiar with in Montana are blue.
Answer: We don?t have a specific make and model in mind.  The color Fresh Huckleberry is an off blue color.
3)	Question: Are the kneelers integral with the pews or separate units?
Answer: The kneelers need to be attached to the chairs but are a separate line item.
4)	Question: All church pews I'm familiar with are made to order.  How important is the delivery date?
Answer: A mistake was made in the combined synopsis/solicitation.  The delivery date shall be 75 days from receiving PO.  Military must have acceptance either at consolidation point or at final destination by the 75 days.
5)	Question: If you have any drawings or picture please provide.
Answer: We don?t have any drawings or pictures.
6)	Question: What is the provision at: DFARS 252.212-7000 and how do we get a copy so that if our product is acceptable that we can bid on this package?
Answer: All FAR and DFARS references can be seen at the web address http://farsite.hill.af.mil/.

<ARCHDATE>09182007
<CONTACT>Scott Hardin, Contract Specialist, Phone 314-263-4211 x121, Fax 314-263-8024, Email scott.j.hardin@nga.mil - Carla Bean, Contract Specialist, Phone 314-263-4211  x116, Email Carla.R.Bean@nga.mil
<DESC>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency has a requirement for the following items:

CLIN 0001:               GEOCUE Bundle to include; GeoCue Enterprise Server License (Quantity 1), GeoCue Client License (Quantity 3), LIDAR 1 CuePac License (Quantity 1), LAS EQC License (Quantity 2), Project Manager CuePac License (Quantity 1), and GeoCue Annual Maintenance Coverage for all of the previouly listed licenses.                 Delivery is expected to be required by 14 Sep 07.  

CLIN 0002:               One Week of GeoCue On-Site Installation and Training (Including Travel and Expenses) (Quantity 5 Days)
                 Expected date of training is within 30 days of contract award.

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:           GeoCue Corporation is the sole producer of GeoCue software.   GeoCue software is required in order for NGA techincal experts to complete ongoing developmental activities.  Additionally, GeoCue software is already integrated into the NGA enterprise and it would not be in the best interest of the Government to procure a new software program in place of our current GeoCue products.  New programs would not meet NGA's requirements of form, fit, and function, nor could they be placed into our infrastructure quickly and easily.  It would be very costly to introduce new software into our enterprise and would require a large amount of time to test new software and to re-train our personnel to use the new programs.     Adding a new brand of software into our system would result in unacceptable work delays and substantially inflated costs.

Offerors are required to submit a completed copy of FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certification--Commercial Items, with their offer.

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:           Applied Imagery is the sole producer of Quick Terrain Modeler software.  QT Modeler software allows users to view LIDAR derived Digital Elevation Models.  Additionally, QT Modeler software is already integrated into the NGA enterprise and it would not be in the best interest of the Government to procure a new software program in place of our current QT Modeler products.

Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears.

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
