<DESC>This notice is a synopsis in accordance with FAR 5.101 for a proposed contract action to Contract W31P4Q-12-C-0098 published at least 15 days before the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals or quotations and a solicitation will not be issued for this requirement.
<p>The Army Contracting Command - Redstone Arsenal intends to award a modification to the existing Tube Launched Optically Tracked Wireless 2 Subsystem (T2SS) Engineering Services (ES) contract which will extend the contract period of performance from 1 February 2016 to 31 October 2017. The extension will provide for the continuation of ES in support of fielded T2SS, components and support equipment.</p>
<p>This nine month extension of services is accomplished pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies of Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. This nine month extension is intended to be awarded to Raytheon Technical Services (RTS) Company under FAR 6.302-1 as award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and there would be unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirement.</p>
<p>This extension is necessary to allow time for the other than Full and Open Competition (FAOC) acquisition of the follow-on contract.</p>
<p>The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in preparation of information or documents related to this nine month additional period of performance extension. Written comments or questions regarding this notice must be emailed to Felicia.m.brown38.civ@mail.mil , david.w.street.civ@mail.mil, and Dorphelia.b.foster.civ@mail.mil.</p>

<DESC>NASA/LARC has a requirement for annual service and support of our Emerson Systems (DeltaV software, AMS Machinery Health Manager, Valvelink and APM Suite). NASA/LARC intends to purchase the items from RE Mason formally Control Dynamics Inc. (CDI). RE Mason is the only certified vendor (in this tri-state region) that can repair, replace, maintain and support Emerson products and in particular the proprietary DeltaV process controls software/hardware. This procurement is part of an agreement renewal and therefore can only be purchased through RE Mason. It would take substantial duplication of resources and time for another source to provide the required service and this additional expense is not expected to be recovered through competition.
<p>The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.</p>
<p>Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing<br />to the identified point of contact not later than 12:00 p.m. local time on 10/25/2016. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to<br />conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete<br />this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely<br />within the discretion of the government.</p>
<p>Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Molecular Epidemiology Assay Support (MEAS)</p>
<p>The mission of the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) National Cancer Institute (NCI) is to conduct population and multidisciplinary research to discover the genetic and environmental determinants of cancer and new approaches to cancer prevention. Many of the studies undertaken by the Division include analyses performed using human biological specimens obtained through family and population-based collection efforts. For approximately thirty (30) years DCEG investigators have been relying on contract services to provide technical assistance in the areas of specimen collection, receipt, processing and in identifying laboratories to perform state-of-the-art testing using high quality biological specimens collected from clinical and field sites.</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to provide support services for studies on the genetic and other cellular events which influence the onset of different types of cancer. Specifically, the Contractor will provide support services for: 1) the procurement, storage and shipment of specimen collection supplies and equipment to international and domestic specimen collection sites and other specimen testing and processing locations; 2) performance of state-of-the-art molecular assays and monitor laboratory performance; and 3) to prepare specimens for transport to testing laboratories by aliquotting, labeling and batching, as needed. Residual specimens will be sent to the NCI Central Repository for long-term storage.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall furnish services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, including secure computers, and facilities, to provide support services to DCEG studies in the areas of receipt and processing of predominantly previously frozen human biospecimens, aliquotting of biospecimens and batching samples for dissemination to laboratories for testing, the ability to identify state-of-the-art laboratories to perform testing, the ability to monitor the performance of laboratory testing, and temporary storage of biospecimens until they are ready to be transferred to the NCI Central Repository in Frederick, Maryland.</p>
<p>Some of the major activities the Contractor will be required to be performed are:</p>
<p>1)  Provide, prepare and transport appropriate supplies, equipment and procedures for collecting, processing, testing and aliquotting biospecimens to designated field sites, processing and testing centers as directed by the COR. The Contractor shall provide supplies for the shipment of specimens back to the Contractor or other designated facility by the COR.</p>
<p>2) Perform aliquotting of previously frozen biospecimens (e.g., sera, plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, urine, feces, saliva/buccal cells, and tumor tissue) as requested by the COR or the NCI Principal Investigator.</p>
<p>3) Perform molecular assays in support of DCEG epidemiology studies.</p>
<p>4) Maintain an interim repository for the storage of human biospecimens and environmental samples (e.g., water and soil samples) that are either destined to be sent to laboratories for testing, are to be aliquotted, or are waiting to be returned to the NCI Central Repository for long-term storage. The total number of specimens is expected to be less than 20,000 and shall be stored in -80&deg;C mechanical freezers. Some +4 &deg;C and ambient storage (less than 15 cubic feet) for both environments combined may also be needed.</p>
<p>5) The Contractor shall utilize the Biological Specimen Inventory (BSI) System (www.bsisystems.com) used by DCEG biospecimen repositories to track and control the acquisition, storage, requisition, and distribution of biospecimens.</p>
<p>The incumbent contract is entitled, " Molecular Epidemiology Assay Support" awarded to PPD Vaccines and Biologics LLC under contract number HHSN261201100105C.</p>
<p>The services will be acquired through full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541380. It is anticipated that one IDIQ contract may be awarded beginning on or about February 7, 2017 with a five (5) year period of performance.</p>
<p>The RFP will be available electronically at a later date and may be accessed through FedBizOpps at www.fbo.gov. <strong>WE ENCOURAGE ALL RESPONSIBLE SOURCES, PARTICULARLY SMALL BUSINESSES, TO SUBMIT A PROPOSAL, WHICH WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE AGENCY.</strong> This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile or email transmissions will be accepted. <strong>IT IS THE OFFEROR'S RESPONSIBILITY TO MONITOR THE ABOVE MENTIONED SITE FOR THE RELEASE OF THE SOLICITATION AND ANY AMENDMENTS.</strong></p>

<DESC>This requirement is for a long-term Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) Requirements type contract based upon Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) evaluation criteria. DLA anticipates awarding multiple requirements contracts with each having one (1) or more CLINS awarded thereunder. The LTC will have a three (3) year base period and two (2) one (1) year Option Periods, for a total of five (5) years. This requirement covers a total of 30 NIINs for Shipping and Storage Containers, listed in the attachment (Appendix A). The procurements will be for quantities totaling 8,680 Shipping and Storage Containers used for the safe keeping and transportation of V-22, H-1, H-60 and Common aircraft components.

All Shipping and Storage Containers listed in Appendix A have an assigned AMC code of 1C/2C Limited Competition in accordance with N241 Source Approval Request Policy for Reusable Shipping and Storage Container Procurements.
 The AMC of 1C/2C means it is suitable for competitive acquisition for the first or second time and these parts require engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activitys procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. Each item has been evaluated by NAVSUP WSS Packaging Engineers Code N241 and has at least two (2) approved sources of supply. If you are unsure if you are an approved source of supply for any item, please contact Kristen Spahr at Kristen.spahr@dla.mil or 215-737-4479 and include the list of NIINs which you are interested in supplying.

All contractors will be required to submit a successful FAT during first resultant order for each NIIN awarded.
 There will be no waivers granted initially whether or not a FAT was previously completed under a prior contract. Once FAT is successfully completed, awardees will not be required to submit additional FAT units for the remainder of the contract for the awarded NIIN.  There are three (3) FAT Groups identified across the 30 NIINs  Group 1: Sealed Containers (23 NIINs), Group 2: Non-Sealed Containers (6 NIINs), Group 3: Sealed Containers with Special Fluid for testing (1 NIIN); see attachment for breakdown of FAT Groups (Appendix B). FAT will be included on the initial delivery order for each NIIN regardless of a prior successful FAT approval for that NIIN. Once a FAT is successfully completed under the Long Term Contract (LTC) it will be waived for the remainder of the LTC for that particular NIIN.
 

Final source selection will be based upon the proposal or proposals which have the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) offer for each CLIN. The Negotiator is planning on awarding multiple contracts, and each contract will contain the LPTA offer for that particular CLIN.

<DESC>Building 200 houses the DISA San Antonio datacenter located at 3326 General Hudnell, San Antonio, Texas, including the electrical and mechanical infrastructure elements, raised floor areas and security systems to provide continuous 24 hour operations. As part of the electrical infrastructure, the building has two electrical power feeds delivering utility power to the facility. The power is delivered at 13.2kV, through a 2,500kVA transformer stepping it down to 480V. Each transformer feeds a walk-in utility switchgear enclosure rated at 3,200Amps. Each utility enclosure contains several breakers. These walk-in utility enclosures are labeled as Utility Bus &lsquo;A' and Utility Bus &lsquo;B'. Each Utility Bus has an output breaker feeding the &lsquo;A' and &lsquo;B' bus Essential Distribution Switchgear. The Essential Distribution Switchgear contains breakers that supply power to the &lsquo;A' Bus and &lsquo;B' Bus UPS Modules, Static Bypass Switches and Maintenance Bypass Switches. The UPS system is set up in a 2(N+1) redundancy, such that either side can be shut down while still maintaining power to all critical equipment. The Essential Distribution Switchgear &lsquo;A' and Essential Distribution Switchgear &lsquo;B' also supply all non-UPS loads including all essential cooling equipment system components (pumps, valves, chillers, cooling towers, etc), lighting, and general building power. <br /><br />Both utility enclosures are supported by the generator back-up power system which automatically transfers both substations to generator power in the event of a commercial power loss. The generator system consists of three (3) Caterpillar 3512 diesel/generator sets rated at 1875kVA/1500kW each, and a full set of generator paralleling switchgear. System is designed for a load of 3750kW with N+1 redundancy. This switchgear cabinet contains the generator tie breakers which feed each of the substation generator breakers. It also houses the paralleling and transfer operations logic and control systems. The generators and switchgear were installed in 2009. A building load test in performed monthly with a simulated utility loss test. The majority of the essential systems components are installed in redundant pairs. The facility is equipped with two 700 ton chillers, two chilled water pumps, two condenser water pumps, and two cooling towers. Only one chiller paired with associated cooling tower and one of each pump is required to meet the facility cooling demands. <br /><br />The Contractor shall segregate the facilities mechanical loads from the critical loads. Currently, the mechanical loads and the critical loads are fed from same the Essential Distribution Switchgear. In order to segregate the mechanical loads from the critical loads (UPS), new UPS distribution switchgear, 2ea new UPS modules will be added and 2ea existing UPS modules will be removed. The existing UPS modules and the new UPS modules will be fed from new Critical Distribution Switchgear including the installation of two new utility transformers to feed the new Critical Distribution Switchgear. The existing mechanical loads will remain being fed from the Essential Distribution Switchgear. The project will also include the addition of one new emergency generator, new generator paralleling switchgear to support the existing generators (3ea) and new generator (1ea) and a new generator control panel. This will result in a more robust and reliable electrical and mechanical distribution system. This system shall allow for an automatic or user initiated closed transition from generators to utility and automatic transition from utility to generators upon commercial power failure. In addition to the new Critical Distribution Switchgear, new UPS Output Critical Distribution Switchboards (2ea) will be installed to feed critical loads in multiple computer rooms.

<p>TE1 Government Furnished Property <br />SECTION 1, GENERAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>1.0 Scope. This Performance work statement (PWS) identifies the mission support requirements of the U.S. Army Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) at Fort Polk, Louisiana. It describes the tasks and functions required by the user and provides the contractor with information concerning the concept, expectations, and performance requirements of the JRTC's Mission Support Contract (MSC).</p>
<p>1.1 Mission Overview. The JRTC is one of the U.S. Army's Combat Training Centers that is focused on providing a realistic, high-end collective training experience at the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) level. The JRTC derives its mission from Army Regulation (AR) 350-50: "Combat Training Center Program." Instructions regarding the implementation of AR 350-50 are provided by various U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) and U.S. Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) supplemental regulations. Both Active and Reserve Component U.S. Army units participate in JRTC rotational exercises. The JRTC's primary focus is on training light infantry, air assault, airborne, and special operations units, including rangers. However, it is not uncommon for JRTC to host rotational exercises for U.S. Army motorized and mechanized formations, as well as selected units from the U.S. Marine Corps or U.S. Navy. U.S. Air Force Close Air Support (CAS) and Air Mobility assets are closely integrated into virtually every rotational exercise. The JRTC is also a critical element in the military's Joint National Training Center initiative which exists to train joint force units and headquarters. Furthermore, in the future, the Joint Readiness Training Center may be required to have the capacity to conduct standard CTC rotations simultaneously to an exportable training capability to either Power Projection Platforms or home station training sites in accordance with higher headquarters direction.</p>
<p>1.2 Rotational Training Units. The Rotational Training Unit (RTU) is typically a U.S. Army BCT of 3-5 maneuver battalions with all habitually supporting elements. Each rotation also typically includes an Area Support Group (ASG) or Corps Support Group (CSG) - and associated subordinate elements - in order to replicate support units from Units of Employment (UEx) and (UEy) levels of command. In addition, U.S. Army Special Operations Forces (SOF) are normally integrated into the rotational exercise. SOF elements are typically task organized around a U.S. Army Special Forces battalion headquarters with habitually supporting CA, PSYOPS, CI, and tactical HUMINT elements, 2 Operational Detachment B's (ODB's) and up to 8 Operational Detachment A's (ODA's). Occasionally, the RTU may have a U.S. Army Aviation Brigade and/or an Army Maneuver Enhancement Brigade (MEB) in Direct Support of their operations. Also, it is not uncommon for an element of a sister service to be under the OPCON or TACON of, or in Direct Support of, the RTU. Examples include USMC conventional units at battalion or F company level, USN gunfire support, or USN/USAF SOF forces. The USAF routinely provides a variety of assets to provide CAS and Tactical Airlift support to the RTU throughout the duration of the rotational exercise. The exact RTU task organization for each rotational exercise remains at the discretion of the government and is normally identified at the rotational exercise Initial Planning Conference (IPC). The JRTC endeavors to conduct the IPC with the RTU approximately 210 days prior to the start of each rotational exercise.</p>
<p>1.3 Standard Rotational Exercises. The JRTC has historically hosted 10 rotational exercises each Fiscal Year (FY). These exercises are typically Full-Spectrum Force-On-Force (FOF) exercises based on any combination of full spectrum operations: Stability Ops Support Ops (SOSO) and Counter Insurgency (COIN) Ops. Standard rotations are typically 14 days in length. Standard rotations take place in a generic region with scenarios and OPFOR threats based on the contemporary operational environment (COE). RTU missions conducted during standard rotations are generally in direct alignment to the RTU's standard METL and training objectives. The Exercise Director provides JRTC P/EMC with general scenario and mission guidance at the rotational IPC. Final command approval of the exercise scenario and mission profile normally occurs at the rotational exercise In-Progress Review, conducted approximately 90 days prior to D-Day. The exact number of rotational exercises that will take place in any FY, as well as their duration, will fluctuate at the discretion of the government. Live Fire Exercises (LFX) are integrated into every rotational exercise. The LFX phase may begin as early as D-10 and continue through change of mission (COM) as discrete operations that are integrated into the fabric of the rotational exercise. Standard rotations will also typically include a Command Post Exercise (CPX) for three maneuver battalion subordinate to the RTU headquarters. During the FOF phase of rotational exercises, training is conducted on a continuous 24-hour per day basis in a free-play mode. Rotational training exercises are fully instrumented and be linked to units in the constructive exercise. In the future typical rotational support provided by the contractor may include additional requirements linked to the reduction in military personnel available for rotational support.</p>
<p>1.4 Special Rotational Exercises. Special rotations are modified standard rotations. The JRTC will schedule special rotations as required. These modified rotations include, but are not limited to, Mission Rehearsal Exercises (MRE), Mission Readiness Exercises (MRX), or exercises that are experimental in nature. Special rotations generally follow the same key event timeline as standard rotations. However, the scenario and mission profiles for special rotations are specially constructed to replicate the environment and conditions that the RTU is likely to encounter in a specific operational theater. Recent MRE/MRX examples include exercises in preparation for RTU deployment to Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Joint Guardian, and Operation Joint Forge. Special rotations frequently involve additional support requirements from the MSC. These additional requirements include, but are not limited to, the following: additional role players; cultural role players; subject matter experts; short notice scenario development adjustments; maneuver area preparation and recovery; MSC support at off-site locations, and fabrication of special props. Increased costs associated with special rotations are provided on a reimbursable cost-plus-award-fee basis. During special rotations, it is common for a Situational Training Exercise (STX) phase of 4-8 days to be added to the rotational exercise - increasing the duration of the total rotational exercise up to 21 days. During the STX phase of rotational exercises, training is normally conducted up to 18 hours per day. Both the STX and FOF phases of special rotations are fully instrumented.</p>
<p>1.4.1 Other unique rotational requirements. During the course of the contract specific training may require additions to paragraphs 1.3 or 1.4. These requirements shall be negotiated by specific modification and charged to the contract under separate CLINs. Requirements will be initially captured by modification and added to contract by attachment. Each modification shall have specific periods of performance noted.</p>
<p>1.5 Rotational Exercise Locations. While not bound by the following list, rotational exercises are typically conducted at or from the following locations:</p>
<p>1.5.1 FOF and STX phases: Within the Fort Polk Maneuver Training Area - to include the Fullerton and Peason Ridge/Horse's Head training areas; England Industrial Air Park (Alexandria, LA); and Camp Beauregard, LA.</p>

<p>5.8.2 Background. Up to twenty mock villages (typical use is 15 villages) in the Fullerton and Peason Ridge training areas of Fort Polk serve as the place setting for Role Play activity on the notional island of Aragon. The focus is on a regional or district government with villages that are self governing at the local level. The national and/or regional governments have very limited capability to provide basic needs and services for its citizens. The economic base primarily focuses on subsistence farming and local trade. All finished goods must be imported from outside the region. There are limited repair parts, hardware, foodstuffs, tools, work clothing, fuel, and other miscellaneous supplies to sustain its day-to-day existence. Public works and utilities, such as telephone, water, electricity, natural gas, sewage and road maintenance are all notionally provided by the host nation or IO or NGO agencies. Law enforcement activities are not extensive or continuous, but have local jurisdiction and are drawn from, and have allegiance to, the local community. The community has a small governing body consisting of a mayor and a council that can regulate community affairs and has jurisdiction over goods and services provided to the citizens by the community. The governing body is chosen and approved by the community at large through the electoral process, which is described in the Area Study. Above all, the community has and maintains all of the freedoms and rights under host nation law, and is not subject to any U.S. military or civil law. The community and its citizens have the ability to resist occupation by, and control of, any of its private assets by U.S. military forces. The use and control of public assets is strictly governed by Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA) between the U.S. and the host nation. These agreements are included in the information received by rotational units. Local government officials perform their duties on a part time basis while tending to their notional occupations in the community on a full time basis. The community consists of farmers and their families, as well as the merchants who provide the goods and services described above.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A Sources Sought Notice ONLY. <br />The US Government currently intends to extend the period of performance for Contract Number W9124Q-07-C-0504 for a six (6) period from 1 December 2016 through 30 June 2017. The six (6) month extension of service clause FAR 52.217-8, "Option to Extend Services" is in the current contract. However, this option period under FAR 52.217-8 was not previously evaluated as part of the initial contract award. An extension is required to maintain continuity of services.
<p>Accordingly, in order to exercise the clause and extend services for an additional six (6) months, the contract action must fall within the ambit of a proper sole-source contract action under FAR Part 6.3. The proposed six (6) months extension for Contract W9124Q-07-C-0504 under the provisions of statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, will be extended on a sole source basis to TRAX International, LLC, 8337 West Sunset Rd, Ste. 250, Las Vegas, NV 89113-2200, for the Mission Support Services (MSS) contract at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), New Mexico. The estimated dollar value of this action is $42 million.</p>
<p>The proposed six (6) month sole source extension under contract W9124Q-07-C-0504, is for the Army Test &amp; Evaluation Command (ATEC) to provide engineering and technical services to support operation and developmental testing for Department of Defense (DoD) program offices at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) and on occasion, at various US and overseas locations. These services consist of augmentation of the Government workforce across the functional areas of WSMR capabilities. Support ranges from operating and maintaining range instrumentation (radar, optics, telemetry, timing...), evaluation of systems under test, development and modernization of range instrumentation systems, flight safety analysis and software engineering.</p>
<p>In response to this sources sought, please provide:</p>

If the Contractor fails or refuses to comply promptly, the Contracting Officer may issue an order stopping all or part of the work, and hold the Contractor in default.

Personnel Clearances and Privacy Act Considerations:  

All Contractor personnel shall be required to observe the requirement imposed on sensitive data by law, federal regulations, VA statutes and policy, VHA policy and associated requirements to ensure appropriate screening of all personnel.  Because of the inherent sensitivity of data at VANTHCS and in the equipment to be maintained under this agreement, the level of security clearance required of the vendor will reflect the same level carried by VANTHCS staff for the function of the contract.  The Contractor will ensure that their personnel and subcontractor personnel meet the above restrictions and that confidential and proprietary information shall be divulged only to those officers and officials of VA authorized to receive such information.  The Contractor will require administrative access to a system that contains sensitive information and that is attached to the VA's network.  This is considered a high security risk and therefore will require a full background investigation.

The vendor is a covered entity under HIPAA and complies with Privacy and Security regulations for Health Care information under HIPAA.


Documentation:

The Contractor will provide Surgical Service and Engineering Service with individual written reports which describe the maintenance and repair service performed on the equipment in sufficient details so as to be acceptable by field inspectors of The Joint Commission.  This shall include a list of all parts replaced, all service performed as well as a statement that the equipment is operating per manufacturer's specifications after repair.  The service report will be signed by the Contractor's service technicians and by the designated VANTHCS personnel.  A copy will be given to VANTHCS for its internal records.
	
Prior to award, the Contractor must have a facility to include personnel, test equipment, parts inventory, licenses and technical documentation available for inspection by VA Medical Center personnel (inspection can be off-site if items are provided for inspection) and be able to show written evidence to the technical qualifications of personnel, test equipment (and calibration documentation) licenses and availability of parts.  Parts availability must be written documentation from either the equipment manufacturer or authorized parts supplier.  In either case, the Contractor must be able to show the availability of parts to him/her within 24 hours after the initial call.  For contracts for maintenance and repair services from other than the original manufacturer or a designated representative, the Contractor will be fully responsible for obtaining all technical documentation necessary to fulfill contractual obligations.


Failure to Restore to Full Performance: 

For failure to restore the equipment to full performance within twenty-fours (24) hours of the original service call or to provide loaner equipment during the interim in which the equipment is being repaired.

Patient Health Information (PHI) and Individually Identifiable Information (III):

This system does not contain Patient Health Information (PHI) and Individually Identifiable Information (III).   No VA data will leave the VA Facility.  If a hard drive or any other electronic storage device needs to be replaced, the device will be given to the ISO.  After destruction of the data by degaussing, the device may be returned to the vendor for inventory control if so requested.  The repair of this system will be supervised by a VA employee in BioMed to assure data does not leave the facility.  The COTR is responsible to assure that no VA data leaves the facility and an employee supervises repair.  No Security & privacy training is needed by the vendor because the repair will be supervised.  No other security statement is needed.

Contracting Officer.  The Agency and its contractors are responsible for preventing the
alienation or unauthorized destruction of records, including all forms of mutilation.

This Notice is published to gain knowledge of Small Business (HUBZone, 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran owned, Veteran Owned and Women Owned Small Business firms) Architect Engineering Firms that are interested in and capable of performing the Architectural and Engineering services detailed below. 

Project Description: 
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) owns and leases healthcare facilities dedicated to serving Veterans.  Providing appropriately planned and designed facilities is critical for the mission of VA. The VA Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) is the office in charge of setting the standards and guidelines that all VA healthcare facilities must follow to accomplish the VA mission.  These standards are detailed in the various planning and design standards contained in the Technical Information Library (TIL). Program Guides (PG) for planning, design, and construction of healthcare facilities: PG 18-9 - Space Planning Criteria; PG 18-5 - Equipment Guide Lists, and PG 18-12 - Design Guides (DG) are among those standards located in CFM Technical Information Library (TIL).  They provide guidance to VA staff and design consultants in the task of planning and designing VA healthcare facilities.  They are closely interrelated, and incorporate current VA/VHA Handbooks, Directives, policies and procedures.  Therefore, information contained within these standards must be well-coordinated, accurate, and consistent throughout.

The purpose of these standards is to define the principles for VA 'Best Practice' in healthcare planning and design, and illustrate concepts that support these principles.  These documents establish a framework within which functional spaces of a healthcare facility can be planned and designed to facilitate safe, effective and efficient healthcare delivery to our Veterans.  CFM has determined the need to revise and update the current planning and design standards for the Spinal Cord Injury/Disorders Center. The A/E firm and its sub-consultants, herein known as Consultant in this Statement of Work (SOW), shall provide the professional services to complete this task with the work items including, but not limited to Scope of Work - Detail, shown in this SOW.

The Consultant shall have experience and expertise in the space programming and planning and the understanding of the functional relationships required in healthcare facilities to provide "state-of-the-art" * health services.  Provide 3-5 examples of past Spinal Cord Injury/Disorder Centers the Consultant has worked on within the last five (5) years.
                                                                                      
 * The level of development (as of a device, procedure, process, technique, or science) reached at any particular time usually as a result of modern methods.

The Consultant shall demonstrate their understanding of the development of flexible, adaptable facilities that will allow VA to reuse and re-purpose these facilities to readily respond to changes in the delivery of care and how this may be applicable to space for the Spinal Cord Injury/Disorders Center.

The Consultant shall provide the teaming and experience to collaborate with VA in the development of updated standards for the Spinal Cord Injury/Disorders Center.   

The Consultant shall be a team of licensed architects and engineers with legal privilege to provide professional consulting services in at least one state, commonwealth, or the District of Columbia, of the United States.

This call is only for the purpose of verifying his/her arrival time at the pickup point and is not necessary if the contractor anticipates no delays for which he/she will claim reimbursement.

5. RATES:
Payment of mileage traveled beyond the 35-mile radius will be limited to "One Way Only" - the distance over which the patient is transported (for ambulatory the distance is 30 miles).

e.	If the Contractor fails to furnish Ambulette/Medical Coach/Wheelchair service within a reasonable time (45 minutes) the Contractor is responsible for furnishing alternate transportation. If the contractor is not able to find alternate transportation the VA reserves the right to obtain the service form another source and to charge the Contractor with any excess cost that may result there from.  The VA shall be the sole judge in determining when to order service from another source. This standard shall be met 95% of the time to be in compliance with contract requirements.  
However, in no instance will the Contractor be required to furnish more than three (4) Ambulette/Medical Coach and six (6) Wheelchair van's at one time.

NASAs Office of Chief Counsel will require each collaborating party to sign a Release Form. Generally, the Release Form will require collaborating parties to waive all claims against the U.S. Government and to indemnify the U.S. Government against third-party claims, for all NASA-sponsored activities during the UTM collaboration. The Release Form will also address the release of UTM test data to collaboration parties and the protection of collaborating parties proprietary data. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">6.

<DESC>The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology (ASA(ALT)), specifically the Program Executive Office (PEO) Simulation, Training, &amp; Instrumentation (STRI), Army Cyber Command and Second Army (ARCYBER &amp; 2A), and the Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) are initiating a Cyber Innovation Challenge to investigate training platform prototype solutions. The intent of the challenge is to evaluate the technical feasibility of solutions for specific focused gap areas relevant to the Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE).
<p>PCTE is a training platform that allows cyber mission forces to train in emulated network environments utilizing current cyber tool suites. The PCTE supports both individual and team training, in addition to large scale exercise and experimentation via a distributed close network across multiple classifications. The evolution of the platform will largely focus on integration of available applications, enabling increased automation to ultimately support multiple simultaneous training events. At maturity, the Department of Defense (DoD) joint Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE) will be a constellation of federated, interoperable common training capabilities enabling full spectrum training from individual competencies to the team, unit, group and force training, exercises, TTP development and mission rehearsal.</p>
<p>Currently, the DoD uses a combination of loosely affiliated or independent virtual environments that lacks the automation necessary to establish and maintain persistent and scalable training environments. Previous analysis efforts have detailed gaps associated with PCTE event planning, event management, training assessment, restoration of the training environments, and automated opposition force. The future of PCTE includes the development and evolution of new capability solutions focused on improving the timeliness and effectiveness to meet the requirements of fully functional cyber mission forces.</p>
<p>The Cyber Innovation Challenge will focus on an unclassified training platform that will provide individual training to the Cyber Mission Forces. It must be a cloud-based, virtualized training environment that is web-based.</p>
<p>An Industry Day is planned for 01 November 2016 at Research Park, Orlando, FL, which will provide Industry/S&amp;T/Academia the opportunity to obtain further details and discuss requirements with the Government sponsors. Additional details and registration information is available at: www.afei.org.

DE-AC52-07NA27344 (Contract 44) with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">is offering the opportunity to commercialize its large ultrathin free-standing polymer films technology.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -1in"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">Background</span></span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">: </span></strong>Ultra-thin polymer films are films with thicknesses below 100 nm. The thinnest freestanding films found in open literature are 20 nm thick and typically have diameters of less than 100 um. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Polymer films of this thickness are typically made by spin coating or dip coating a dilute solution of the polymer onto a substrate. The substrate must be specially prepared to release the film: it can be freshly cleaved mica, or it can be a more typical substrate such as clean glass or silicon prepared with a release layer. This layer is typically a sacrificial layer that is dissolved when the film is removed from the substrate, such as sputtered salt or soap layers or similar release agents.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">The films are removed from the substrate by immersing the substrate into water, which separates the film from the substrate, and the film will float on the water surface. From here, the films are transferred to the holder, commonly a grid with small (typically sub-micron to 100 um) openings that define the free-standing area of film.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">The current method has several disadvantages, most of which are connected to the substrate. The substrate preparation can introduce roughness, especially in the case of sputtered liftoff layers, which can be on the order of several nanometers, which leads to film non-uniformity and becomes more severe as the film thickness is reduced below 20 nm. Sacrificial liftoff layers can contaminate the film and decrease the strength of the film. At thicknesses lower than 30 nm, the liftoff of the film from the substrate becomes impossible for some preparations.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">A second drawback is the inability to produce large free-standing films. This inability is related to the shape of the holder, the liftoff technique itself, and the properties of the polymer that is used to produce the thin film. Large films will often tear when lifted out of the water, and in some cases they tear while drying.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -1in"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">Description</span></span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">LLNL's Polyelectrolyte Enabled Liftoff (PEEL) process makes changes to the substrate preparation, the holder and liftoff technique, and suggests modifications to the material itself to enable the preparation of large ultrathin free-standing films.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">PEEL enables ultrathin films by chemically modifying the deposition substrate and decreasing the interfacial energy so that even thin films with small strain energies will delaminate.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">PEEL employs robust, water-based, and self-optimizing surface chemistry to fabricate ultrathin films up to 100 cm<sup>2</sup> or more in area.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">LLNL's PEEL technology is used to fabricate free-standing polymer films as thin as 10 nm that are capable of bearing loads ranging from milligrams to grams and deformations of up to 40%. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -1in"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">Advantages</span></span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">PEEL produces free-standing films that are distinct from those that use the sacrificial </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">interlayer in three main ways: 1) stronger films, 2) larger areas, 3) and thinner films.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">LLNL's PEEL fabrication method overcomes the limitations of earlier methods and can produce films of less than 10 nm thickness and diameters of greater than 10 mm.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">PEEL provides an alternative to membrane manufacturing processes like interfacial polymerization, accessing thicknesses and areas that are not accessible by current technologies.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">The PEEL process is easily scalable in size and manufacturing quantity and applicable to a variety of polymeric materials.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -1in"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">Potential Applications</span></span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></strong></p>
<p>The current primary use of PEEL is to produce ultrathin films for the assembly of inertial confinement fusion targets. These targets have a fuel capsule that must be supported with minimal mass to avoid perturbations to the implosion.</p>
<p>PEEL may also be used to fabricate free-standing polymer films for sensing, catalysis, filtration, and wound-healing applications.</p>
<p>Other potential uses involve the fabrication of separation membranes for carbon capture and for desalination.</p>
<p>Sample substrates for transmission electron microscopy and other microscopy or x-ray methods also frequently use very thin films to maximize contrast with the sample.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1.5in; TEXT-INDENT: -1.5in"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Development Status:</span></strong></p>
<p>LLNL's PEEL process is already in daily use at the National Ignition Facility (NIF), a national security and energy research facility, where it is used to fabricate compliant loadbearing polyvinyl formal (PVF) membranes that capture and center the hollow fuel spheres used as laser targets.</p>

<DESC>NAVSEA intends to hold an Industry Day on October 28, 2016.
<p>The Navy incurs various additional costs above the contract price when completing maintenance and modernization availabilities away from the vessel's home port. The additional costs the Navy incurs for moving vessels and crew members between their home ports and other locations for overhaul and repair work are known as "interport differential costs." In accordance with 10 USC 7299a, before awarding work among competing shipyard offerors, the Navy determines the reasonably predictable &amp; foreseeable "interport differential costs" of moving the vessel and its crew from the homeport to the outside place of performance and back, and adds those costs to the proposed contract price in order to determine each offeror's evaluated price to the government.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Industry Day is to make the ship repair community aware of the Navy's processes and procedures utilized to develop the interport cost differentials, as well as the constraints the Navy experiences when calculating foreseeable costs with reasonable certainty. Additionally, this forum will give the Navy an opportunity to receive feedback from the ship repair industry on matters relating to the calculation of the foreseeable interport differential costs.<br />Date &amp; Time: October 28, 2016 beginning at 12:30pm and concluding at approximately 2:30pm Eastern Daylight Time.</p>
<p>Where: Alion Science and Technology, 1100 New Jersey Ave SE, Suite 200 Independence Room, Washington D.C. 20003 (Pay parking lots available in the vicinity)</p>
<p>RSVP: Interested parties are required to RSVP for the Industry Day by 1:00pm Eastern Time on 24 October 2016 by email to Mr. Doug McCreary at Douglas.McCreary@navy.mil. The RSVP shall include the following information:</p>
<p>Subject line: "NAVSEA Interport Differential Industry Day RSVP," and in the body of the email please provide the attendees' names, company name, e-mail addresses, and telephone numbers. Interested parties are limited to 5 attendees per respondent/company on a first come first served basis. The Government will not reimburse costs for any effort expended or any material provided in response to this announcement.</p>

<DESC>This notice is to advise industry that the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWARSYSCEN) Atlantic, Charleston, SC, intends to extend the period of performance for the subject multiple award contracts in support of Battlespace Awareness (BA) and Integrated Cyber Operations (ICO) from the date of their expiration to 11 June 2020 (See Attachment 1).  This extension is necessary for future compliance of the recently sustained Harris and AllWorld cases upheld by Government Accountability Office (GAO) where task order period of performance exceeded the prime contract expiration and permitted performance beyond the 180 days specified in FAR Clause 52.216-22.  This extension period is planned to only allow currently awarded task orders to complete performance or those requirements that cannot be awarded through an existing internal or external contract vehicle.  Once the future command wide contracts are awarded, it is not the intent of the Government to issue new task orders under these extensions. This extension is necessary to permit the continuity of services to meet the current and immediate future demands of SPAWARSYSCEN Atlantic.  This action is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition of the work required would be advantageous to the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this contract period of performance extension based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Written comments or questions regarding this notice must be emailed to Betty Norris at elizabeth.norris@navy.mil by no later than 03 November 2016.

<p>FAR 52.222-52 -- Exemption From Application Of The Service Contract Labor Standards To Contracts For Certain Services--Certification (May 2014)</p>
</strong>
<p>(a) The offeror shall check the following certification:</p>
<strong>
<p>CERTIFICATION</p>
<p>The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that-</p>
</strong>
<p>(1) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations;</p>
<p>(2) The contract services are furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices. An "established catalog price" is a price included in a catalog, price list, schedule, or other form that is regularly maintained by the manufacturer or the offeror, is either published or otherwise available for inspection by customers, and states prices at which sales currently, or were last, made to a significant number of buyers constituting the general public. An "established market price" is a current price, established in the usual course of ordinary and usual trade between buyers and sellers free to bargain, which can be substantiated from sources independent of the manufacturer or offeror;</p>
<p>(3) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and</p>
<p>(4) The offeror uses the same compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract as the offeror uses for these employees and for equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>(b) Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services. If the offeror certifies to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision, and the Contracting Officer determines in accordance with FAR 22.1003-4(d)(3) that the Service Contract Act-</p>
<p>(1) Will not apply to this offeror, then the Service Contract Labor Standards clause in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract to this offeror; or</p>
<p>(2) Will apply to this offeror, then the clause at FAR 52.222-53, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Labor Standards to Contracts for Certain Services--Requirements, in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract awarded to this offer, and the offeror may be provided an opportunity to submit a new offer on that basis.</p>
<p>(c) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision-</p>
<p>(1) The clause of this solicitation at 52.222-53, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Labor Standards to Contracts for Certain Services--Requirements, will not be included in any resultant contract to this offeror; and</p>

<p>CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />SUP 5252.204-9400 Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (July 2013)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY <br />This clause applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES <br />Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS <br />In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager. Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC) described below. Due to the privileged system access, a SSBI suitable for High Risk public trusts positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-Ni therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>INTERIM ACCESS <br />The Navy Command' s Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS <br />The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE <br />The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES <br />Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Navy recognizes contractor employees under this contract as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The NACLC consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>* SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product) <br />* Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission) <br />* Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Navy Command Security Manager. The Navy Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Suitability/security issues identified by the Navy may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination made by the Navy is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Navy Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DON Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Navy Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO OR PERFORMING NON-SENSITIVE DUTIES <br />Contractor employee whose work is unclassified and non-sensitive (e.g., performing certain duties such as lawn maintenance, vendor services, etc ...) and who require physical access to publicly accessible areas to perform those duties shall meet the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p>* Must be either a US citizen or a US permanent resident with a minimum of 3 years legal residency in the United States (as required by The Deputy Secretary of Defense DTM 08-006 or its subsequent DoD instruction) and <br />* Must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) including a FBI fingerprint check prior to installation access.</p>
<p>To be considered for a favorable trustworthiness determination, the Contractor's Security Representative must submit for all employees each of the following:</p>
<p>* SF-85 Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions <br />* Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission) <br />* Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure each individual employee has a current favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) or ensure successful FBI fingerprint results have been gained and investigation has been processed with OPM.</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>* Consult with your Command Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager for local policy when IT-III (non-sensitive) access is required for non-US citizens outside the United States.</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Standardization Action (SA) for the standardization of Resistance Exercise Bands. Only those vendors on the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) MN-1508-50_Resistance_Exercise_Bands are eligible for participation. The MMESO North is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /><br /></strong>These Resistance Exercise Bands products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this Sources Sought Notification is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/.<br /><br />This Sources Sought Notification is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the QSL MN-1508-50_Resistance_Exercise_Bands. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of three (3) years (36 months) from date of selection, with one (1) 24-month "option" period not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is December 2016. Among vendors who are on QSL MN-1508-50_Resistance_Exercise_Bands, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA.</strong> The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Resistance Exercise Bands.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Resistance Exercise Bands. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $879,251 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD). The specifications for this project are shown in Requirements below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on QSL MN-1508-50_Resistance_Exercise_Bands who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this Sources Sought Notification via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below.</strong> In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO North that the submission and quote were received by the MMESO North via email, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, e-mail, or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an Incentive Agreement.<br /><br /></strong>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />Pricing analysis of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price will be evaluated based on unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. Best overall price will be the determining factor in vendor selection for an Incentive Agreement for Standardization. Quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing. The Government intends to make a selection based on initial quotes but reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission</span><br />The pricing requirements are outlined below. Complete pricing offer and vendor information must be submitted in full to the MMESO POCs by the response date of this Sources Sought Notification. <strong>Vendor part numbers, pricing and packaging MUST match those that were submitted and qualified to the subject QSL FBO. Vendors not currently on the subject QSL will not be considered for an IA. Use these instructions to complete the IA FBO Package Worksheet. Vendors who are not selected will be notified in writing upon issuance of an IA.<br /><br /></strong>1.	Vendor must submit the following information via IA FBO Package Worksheet for each QSL required item: Vendor Part Number (PN), Manufacturer PN, Manufacturer Name, Full Item Description, DAPA Number for Item, Unit of Measure (UOM), Quantity (QTY) in UOM, Unit of Inner Packaging (UOP), QTY of UOM in UOP, Unit of Sale (UOS), QTY of UOM in UOS, UOS Base Price, UOS Incentive Price, UOM Base Price and UOM Incentive Price.<br /><strong><br />Item Descriptions /	Annual Usage in Units /</strong><br />1.

Vendor will be required to submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower base uncommitted government prices are available, such as Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices, incentive tier is expected to be lower than such prices. This is because DAPAs, unlike other government prices, are base uncommitted. A vendor shall not quote base uncommitted prices such as FSS prices as the discounted tier price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendor must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities, which is used as the identification number for Federal Contractors.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br /><br />Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA <br /><br />(End of provision)</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

52.212-2, EvaluationCommercial Items, or other description of evaluation factors for award (Oct 2014)

(a) The Government will award a firm-fixed price contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
 (i) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement;
(ii) price;
(iii) past performance (see FAR 15.304);
The award decision will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-factors as listed above.
Technical: Written confirmation that company specializes in, or has sufficient documented direct  experience in, providing all labor, material, tools, supervision and travel necessary to provide portable toilet service as described in the SOW.
 
Price:  A price evaluation will be performed to determine the reasonableness of the proposed price. Reasonableness will be determined considering other competitive prices received and comparison to the independent Government estimate. If multiple contract line items are included in the price schedule, prices will also be evaluated to determine whether any line items are unbalanced. Offerors are cautioned to distribute costs appropriately.

Past Performance:  completed Past Performance Questionnaires that can confirm your company has successfully completed all tasks outlined in the Statement of Work.

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the USCG to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time&not; consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33. I 03(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33. I 03(c). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.rnil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.<br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract
awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was
established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a
prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an
Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some
external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file
a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG
procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable
Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested
parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under
this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of
an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or
other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following
information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting
Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,
protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer
through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent
Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either
the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.
Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award
or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in
writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in
less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth
in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the
protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed
within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program
should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand
delivery to the Contracting Officer.

Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the
Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not
to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external
forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.<br /></p>

<p>Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Oct 2014)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(i) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement;</p>
<p>(ii) price;</p>
<p>(iii) past performance (see FAR 15.304);</p>
<p>Technical and past performance, when combined, are Significantly less important than cost or price.</p>
<p><br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(End of Provision)</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Resistance Exercise Bands. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO North is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /><br /></strong>These Resistance Exercise Bands products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Resistance Exercise Bands in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.  In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, you must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item offered. If an item offered is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a waiver exists or if the Government will seek a waiver for the item. Unless a waiver exists or is granted, TAA Non-Compliant County End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA.  Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />The QSL for Resistance Exercise Bands will be established approximately November 2016 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately December 2016 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Resistance Exercise Bands. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Resistance Exercise Bands.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Resistance Exercise Bands. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $879,251.00.  This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Ten (10) items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 67.98% ($591,751.66) of the total volume in sales ($879,251.00).  The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and Email address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt; allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br /><br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, email, or hard copy).&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /><br /></strong>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements to Qualify for QSL<br /></span>The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL. Vendors must provide responses to this Sources Sought notification via the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.<br /></strong>1.	Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the product line listed. Vendor must provide their DAPA number or provide documentation and date the DAPA number was applied for. Vendors who do not continue to process application for a DAPA number will not be considered for continued participation.<br />2.	Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor CARDINAL HEALTH, or must work with CARDINAL HEALTH to initiate an agreement. <br />3.	Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor OWENS &amp; MINOR, or must work with OWENS &amp; MINOR to initiate an agreement.<br />4.

Vendors who do not continue to process application for a CAGE Code and/or a SAM account will not be considered for continued participation. See https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. <br /><br />5.	<strong>Vendor offered products should be TAA compliant.  End-items offered shall be manufactured or substantially transformed either in the U.S. or in Designated or Qualifying countries. Therefore, the vendor at the item level must provide country of origin for all required items and any optional items offered.</strong> Vendor must provide product catalog &amp; literature for any items offered in response to this Sources Sought Notification. Vendor must submit the following information via QSL FBO Package Worksheet for each offered product: Full item description, Distributor Part Number, Manufacturer Part Number, Manufacturer Name, Number of eaches in Unit of Sale, and country of origin.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Wound Drains. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /><br /></strong>These Wound Drains products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Wound Drains in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, you must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item offered. If an item offered is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a waiver exists or if the Government will seek a waiver for the item. Unless a waiver exists or is granted, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />The QSL for Wound Drains will be established approximately October 2016 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately November 2016 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Wound Drains. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Wound Drains.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Wound Drains. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $664,571. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Fourteen items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 57.15% ($379,840) of the total volume in sales ($664,571). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.

<DESC>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) has a requirement for On-site Animal Care, Technical Procedures, Formulation, and Veterinary Care Services in support of FDA's mission. NCTR is located at the Jefferson Laboratory Complex in Jefferson, AR.
<p>NCTR requires support services to NCTR's animal research program, but not limited to the provision of quality care to all research animals, sanitation of all animal care and diet preparation/formulation facilities, provision of protocol-specified technical procedures, provision of veterinary care to the non-human primate colony, and provision of formulation services (receipt, storage, formulation, packaging, and distribution of animal diets and test articles). Ancillary tasks necessary to accomplish these services are included (e.g., quality control, occupational safety and health, inventory control, equipment maintenance, development and maintenance of standard operating procedures, and a comprehensive training program). The need for these services is paramount as the preponderance of NCTR's research mission can only be accomplished through animal research. In addition, major funding sources for the Center's research program, such as the National Toxicology Program, mandate animal-based research projects. Such projects are highly regulated and demand exemplary execution.</p>
<p>This solicitation is set aside 100% for small business.</p>
<p>This is a follow-on acquisition for continuous on-site Animal Care services presently being performed by Priority One Services, Inc. (POS) under contract number HHSF223201110018C.</p>

<DESC><p>Amendment 2 Details: <br /><br />The&nbsp;frequency chart on page 10 of the solicitation has been updated.&nbsp; The Minturn office requires twice per week basic cleaning. Stripping and waxing the floors has been added to the chart for Silverthorne and Rifle.&nbsp; <br /><br />A change sheet has been added to the list of documents&nbsp;to replace page 10.&nbsp; This frequency chart is the definitive list of frequencies rather than the chart at the end of each SOW.<br /><br />Note: stripping and waxing depends upon&nbsp; the type of hard floors.&nbsp; For hard floors where stripping and waxing is not appropriate, this may involve substitution of additional machine scrubbing to remove build up that can't be removed with normal sweeping and mopping.<br /><br />Solicitation has been extended until October 28th in consideration of these changes. We expect to award in mid-November.</p>

<DESC>The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, &amp; Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology (ASA(ALT)), Army Cyber Command and Second Army (ARCYBER &amp; 2A), and US Cyber Command are hosting an Industry Day for the Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE).
<p><br />When: Tuesday, November 1, 2016, 9:00am to 3:00pm <br />Where: 3039 Technology Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826, Partnership III Building, Room 321<br />Who: Interested organizations to include Industry, Government, Science and Technology, and Academia <br />Why: 1) Provide an overview of the PCTE requirement and concept of operation to support the receipt of white papers recommending technical solutions (morning session); 2) Initiate a Cyber Innovation Challenge for a specific technology supporting PCTE training (afternoon session).</p>
<p>Registration information ais available at the Association for Enterprise Information's website - http://www.afei.org/events/7A30/Pages/default.aspx.</p>
<p>1) PCTE is a training platform that allows cyber mission forces to train in emulated network environments utilizing current cyber tool suites. The PCTE supports both individual and team training, in addition to large scale exercise and experimentation via a distributed close network across multiple classifications. The evolution of the platform will largely focus on integration of available applications, enabling increased automation to ultimately support multiple simultaneous training events. At maturity, the DoD joint PCTE will be a constellation of federated, interoperable common training capabilities enabling full spectrum training from individual competencies to the team, unit, group and force training, exercises, TTP development and mission rehearsal.</p>
<p>Currently, the DoD uses a combination of loosely affiliated or independent virtual environments that lacks the automation necessary to establish and maintain persistent and scalable training environments. Previous analysis efforts have detailed gaps associated with PCTE event planning, event management, training assessment, restoration of the training environments, and automated opposition force. The future of PCTE includes the development and evolution of new capability solutions focused on improving the timeliness and effectiveness to meet the requirements of fully functional cyber mission forces.</p>
<p>A Request for Information (RFI) was issued on October 17, 2016 requesting white papers providing possible technical solutions, capabilities, and critical cost/schedule drivers related to the PCTE. The full submission requirements for this RFI can be found at the following link: https://www.fbo.gov/notices/84b62e986a83e3378fcffd38454f65dd. <br /><br />2) The Innovation Challenge requirement will be released to the members of the Command, Control, and Communications in Cyberspace (C5) Consortium (c5technologies.org) utilizing Other Transaction Authority (OTA) as the vehicle to promote increased small and non-traditional industry engagement with Government. Selected industry partners from the consortium will be invited to demonstrate their system with training content provided by the Government. This Cyber Innovation Challenge will focus specifically on an unclassified training platform as part of the larger PCTE platform.</p>
<p>There is limited space available at this event so all interested parties should register as soon as possible at the registration link provided below. Attendees must provide Government issued identification upon arrival. Check in starts at 0800. Foreign Nationals may not attend this event.</p>
<p>Registration link: http://www.afei.org/events/7A30/Pages/default.aspx<br /><br /><br />/// Attendees will also have the opportunity to participate in a 20-minute one-on-one session with the Government Project Management Office on November 2, 2016 from 0900-1200 and 1300-1600. The one-on-one's will take place on the same campus as the Industry Day with specific locations to be provided after sign-up. Please sign-up for the one-on-one session by contacting Mr. Brian Serra, <a href="mailto:brian.d.serra.civ@mail.mil">brian.d.serra.civ@mail.mil</a>. ///<br /><br /><strong>UPDATE 19 OCT: All one-on-one sessions have been filled and slots are no longer available. If you would like to sign up on a waiting list in case of a cancellation, please contact Mr. Brian Serra as listed above.</strong></p>

The Partnership II/III parking lot is authorized parking for occupants only. Also, do not parking in the AT&amp;T parking lot as your car will be subject to being towed.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This announcement is not a contract, request for proposal, a promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind on the part of the Government. The Government will not assume liability for costs incurred by an attendee or for travel expenses or marketing efforts; therefore, attendee cost in response to this notice is not considered an allowable direct charge to the Government.</p>

<DESC><p>Amendment 0003-&nbsp; This amendment is issued to provide&nbsp;a response&nbsp;to questions received&nbsp;from the&nbsp;industy as followed:<br /><br />1) I never did receive an answer from you as to why this was not now posted as a Small Business project. Was our prior submittal not adequate? Were there not enough submittals? I am just looking for information so as to better prepare ourselves for the next opportunity. Any info appreciated.</p>
<p>Response: 1) We cannot disclose information regarding the acquisition planning stage of this acquisition.</p>
<p>2) Is (was) there an existing contractor for this type of project for the US Army (Yuma) in the past couple of years? I should think this would be public information, though perhaps not all of the particular task assignments. If so, are they allowed to bid again for this contract? I ask because perhaps I could contact them for teaming opportunities.</p>
<p>Response: 2) The prior contractor was Desert Research Institute under contract number W9124R-11-D-0211. You must submit a request under the Freedom of Information Act to obtain more information.</p>
<p>3) In our prior submittal, I pointed out that the Task Descriptions were really too broadly presented to allow us to formulate a specific scope and cost proposal for each Task. I was hoping that in this actual solicitation they would be better defined and specific priorities assigned. Unfortunately, the document is essentially identical with respect to the tasks. Is there any expectation that a more defined and prioritized research program will be forthcoming?</p>
<p>Response: 3) The Army's intent is for an offeror to provide the government with the latest technology in the characterization of soils and how they affect military material. It is the offeror's responsibility to come up with the specifics for the government to evaluate.<br /><br />4) There is discussion of support for the Test Center's facilities other than Yuma, but there is nothing specific enough from which to develop a cost for such tasks. How would one budget for such visits, meetings, or actual work programs?</p>
<p>Response: 4) It is an offeror's responsibility to develop and propose an estimate or processes.<br /><br />5) Is there any plan for an on-site presentation/discussion of the scope of work by the Army at Yuma, i.e. a pre-proposal meeting before the submittal?</p>
<p>Response 5) No, there is not.</p>

<DESC>AMENDMENT A002:  THE PURPOSE FOR THIS AMENDMENT IS DESCRIBED AS FOLLOW:

1.  A Challenger 601 EQUIPMENT LIST HAS BEEN ATTACHED BELOW.  

2.  IN ORDER TO PROVIDE INTERESTED VENDORS AMPLE TIME TO REVIEW THE NEW ATTACHMENT AND UPDATE RESPONSE THE CLOSING DATE FOR THIS MARKET SURVEY IS EXTENDED TO CLOSE OF BUSINESS, FRIDAY-NOV. 04, 2017.

AMENDMENT A001:  THE CLOSING DATE FOR THIS MAREKT SURVEY HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO CLOSE OF BUSINES, OCTOBER 28, 2016.

NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.  ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE IN WRITING AND EMAILED TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER.  CONTACT INFORMATION BELOW.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Flight Inspection Services (FIS) is conducting this Market Survey/Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes to meet a requirement to upgrade the avionics suites currently installed in the FAAs three (3) Bombardier CL-601 aircraft.  The FAA is requesting a rough order of magnitude (ROM) for the cost, systems/equipment, and time necessary to accomplish the upgrade and obtain approval for required Supplemental Type Certificates (STCs) necessary to make these aircraft flight ready (See Attachment A).  This modification will upgrade the current avionics suite and equipment (currently a 1995 version similar to that found on the Lear Jet 60 standard avionics suite configuration) to an FAA and ICAO 2020 compliant aircraft avionics suite configuration in addition to meeting all 2020 ADS-B Out mandates and must include the following avionics systems:

  Future Air Navigation (FANS) 1/A with Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC)
  R3 Global Positioning Systems (GPS)  Install Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) capable GPS
  Flight Management System (FMS)  Introduction of Required Navigation Performance (RNP) AR 0.3 capability
  Weather Radar System  Multi-scan Weather Radar
  ATC Transponder System  Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B DO-260B) 

The FAA is open to all upgrades that provide the aircraft with the mandated 2020 avionics capabilities and requirements to enable them to fly anywhere in the world.  The FAA does prefer that a proposed upgrade is based on the ProLine 21 Avionics Suites with Advanced Avionics capability similar to that called out in Service Bulletins 605-34-019 and 605-00-003 Rev. 11; based on efficiencies from fleet standardization of aircraft systems.  The most critical estimate is for the cost and time it will take to complete the upgrade on the first aircraft, taking into consideration the following

  Cost of engineering
  Time and cost of de-installation of old systems--taking out old wiring and installation of new cabling harness
  Time and cost to install the new equipment
  Time and cost of systems integration of the remaining old systems that are required to work with the newly installed avionics equipment/systems, and
  Time and cost to obtain the required certifications and STCs to have the first aircraft flying fully certified.  

In addition to the Learjet 60 Avionics system installed on the FAAs CL-601 aircraft, the FAA has added additional modifications to the aircraft that may be impacted by the requirement to upgrade.  Some of the systems below will require the vendor to remove and replace with new updated avionics equipment/systems; new wiring; and cabling harness.  Other system listed below will stay on the aircraft but will require integration to work with the newly installed avionics equipment and systems.  A list of these supplemental modifications is shown below.  Those marked with (**) are systems that will stay on the aircraft after modification and may be required to interface with the new avionics systems to be installed:

  **Passenger Oxygen Systems -- SA5940SW thru Rev 01
  **AVIAC Horizontal Stabilizer Trim Control Systems -- ST00210WI thru Rev. B
  **Auxiliary Power System, .PAT, -- ST0033NY through Rev 02

As stated above, this Market Survey is requesting information from vendors who have business experience in upgrading and modifying general aviation jet aircraft to meet the FAAs 2020 ADS-B Out mandate.  

The information requested at this time is for planning purposes only and for the development of a source list.  The FAA needs sound cost and time estimations on the effort it will take to bring the FAAs Challenger 601 aircraft (22 years old or older) to sustain flying another 10 to 15 years; and, meets both FAA and ICAO avionics standards.  As a part of this Market Survey, we ask interested vendors to complete Attachment A to this survey.  The information needs to be provided as a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM).  This form requests information on:

  Cost of non-recurring engineering required for STC preparation and submittal for approval
  Time and cost of old systems/equipment removal
  Time and cost for installation of new equipment /Systems wiring and cabling upgraded, and 
  Time and cost to install the new avionics systems/equipment on the aircraft and meet the FAA and ICAO requirements for 2020 flights in the U.S. or anywhere in the world.  

The information in Attachment A is broken out for the first aircraft (aircraft to be submitted for STC approval) and then follow-on installations of that approved STC on the second and third CL-601 aircraft.  

Any information provided information will be determined to be proprietary to each vendor if provided with proprietary markings and will only be seen by FAA personnel and will not be released.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes and size standards for this effort:

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">This is modification 3 to the special notice entitled, Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) Program Integration Contract II (MPIC II) - NNJ16591055L. The purpose of this modification is to inform all interested parties that the Government does not intend to issue a solicitation for MPIC II.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>At this time, the Government intends to cease all efforts related to the MPIC II acquisition, and no further notices will be posted. The Johnson Space Center appreciates your interest in MPIC II and encourages interested parties to monitor the NASA Acquisition Forecast for other business opportunities (https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/forecast/). <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Procurement Background<br /></span><br />The Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) Program Integration Contract (MPIC) provides program, planning, and control (PP&amp;C) and engineering support services to the Orion MPCV Program and is currently in its final year of performance (ending September 30, 2017), with no additional options left to exercise. In June 2016, the Procurement Development Team (PDT) began efforts to compete the follow-on contract, MPIC II.</p>
<p>On June 6, 2016, the Government issued a Request for Information (RFI), NNJ16591055L, for industry to provide input for MPIC II. The RFI closed on July 1, 2016 with 13 responses received. On September 13, 2016, the Government hosted a Virtual Industry Day, and conducted one-on-one meetings September 14-15, 2016. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Procurement Strategy Forward</span><br /><br />After considering all market research obtained during the RFI and one-on-ones, reviewing Johnson Space Center (JSC)'s overall contract portfolio, and considering the Orion MPCV Program's overall acquisition strategy, the PDT determined that it was in the best interest of the Government to integrate the anticipated MPIC II requirements into an existing JSC contract. This decision aligns with JSC's 2.016 goals to improve our ways of doing business and the Strategic Acquisition Forecast Evaluation (SAFE) initiative which provides an integrated and efficient acquisition strategy for recurring procurement needs. <br /><br />The PP&amp;C and engineering support services required by the Orion MPCV Program are in scope of the Mission and Program Integration (MAPI) contract NNJ12GA46C, which has options through September 30, 2020. Therefore, the Government plans to utilize the MAPI Contract to meet the Orion Program PP&amp;C and engineering support requirements beginning October 1, 2017.</p>

<DESC>U.S. Navy Patrol Boat (PB-X)<br />Solicitation Number: N00024-17-R-2208/2209<br />Agency: Department of the Navy<br />Office: Naval Sea Systems Command<br />Location: NAVSEA HQ
<p>Synopsis:<br />DISCLOSURE:<br />This is a Sources Sought notice only. This is not a Request For Proposal (RFP) and a formal solicitation is not available at this time. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the Government to issue an RFP, contract, or order.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought is for informational planning purposes only. It is not a Request for Information (RFI) and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for any actual procurement of materials, machinery, or services. This Sources Sought does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. The Government will not pay for any effort expended or any material provided in response to this announcement. All costs associated with responding to this Sources Sought are solely at the responding parties' expense.</p>
<p>Please note that only boat builders located in the United States are eligible to submit a proposal should an RFP be issued for PB-X (Patrol Boat X). Designs which originate outside the U.S. are permitted as long as the builder can meet all United States manufacturing and other domestic solicitation requirements.</p>
<p>The Government will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative because of this Sources Sought. Not responding to this Sources Sought does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if one is issued.</p>
<p>PURPOSE:<br />The overall objective of this Sources Sought is to provide industry and interested parties with information that will assist in the understanding of current technical requirements and projected near term schedule for a potential PB-X solicitation. No specific information is required in response to this Sources Sought; however, interested parties may respond and indicate interest as desired.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought is provided as an update to, and supersedes the previous PB-X Sources Sought/ RFI's issued in: June 2015 (solicitation numbers N00024-15-R-2223 and N00024-15-R-2225 issued to NAICS 336611 and 336612 respectively) and December 2015 (solicitation numbers N00024-15-R-2208 and N00024-16-R- 2209 issued to NAICS 336611 and 336612 respectively).</p>
<p>The Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA) is hereby issuing a Sources Sought on behalf of the Support Ships, Boats, and Craft Program Office (PMS 325), to provide industry the status of the Navy's plans to recapitalize the Navy Expeditionary Combat Command's (NECC) 25 feet and 34 feet Patrol Boats (Force Protection boats) that are currently in use with the NECC Coastal Riverine Force (CRF). Subject to annual appropriations, the Navy intends to replace approximately 100-160 of these boats over the next 15 years with a larger craft with a nominal length of 40-ft. This new craft is currently designated as PB-X. Based on the responses to the previous RFI's, and subsequent Government analysis, the technical requirements for PB-X have been adjusted and are provided in Attachment (1). Listed below are the notable boat requirements that have been revised from previous RFI's:</p>
<p>&bull; Boat Length &bull; Crew/Mission Personnel<br />&bull; Endurance &bull; Habitability (Seating)<br />&bull; Range &bull; Transportation (Land)<br />&bull; Mission Payload &bull; Durability</p>
<p>Other requirements have also been clarified and interested parties are encouraged to fully review Attachment 1 in detail.</p>
<p>The notional schedule listed below is provided for planning purposes only. The Government is not obligated to pursue this schedule or a future solicitation because of this Sources Sought.<br />1. Release draft RFP and final RFP in early FY17.<br />2. Conduct PB-X Industry Day on Friday, 2 December 2016 at the Morial Convention Center, New Orleans, LA.</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">PB-X will be designated as an <strong>ACAT III</strong> program. The Navy plans to award an initial 5-year IDIQ contract in FY17 for at least 18 boats. After contract award the Government will conduct a series of Design Reviews and a Production Readiness Review with the builder that will occur prior to the start of Initial Production. In addition to the delivery of the boat, the successful bidder will provide engineering and design services, crew familiarization training, an initial spares package, technical documentation, configuration management and post-delivery test and logistics support. In order to support follow-on contract awards for additional boats, the Government intends to pursue <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Government Purpose Rights (GPR)(as defined in DFARS 252.227-7013) to technical data such as work packages from the Contractor's Engineering Department to the Production Department.

<p>Not responding to this or previous Sources Sought related to PB-X does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if one is issued.</p>

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, Pacific (SSC Pacific), intends to issue Request for Proposal (RFP) No. N66001-17-R-0169 for Global Readiness and Force Management Enterprise (GRFME). Multiple awards are anticipated.
This acquisition is partially a follow-on procurement to the multiple award contract (MAC) N66001-13-D-0073 through 0076 for Defense Readiness Reporting System Strategic (DRRS-S).  N66001-13-D-0073 through 0076 were awarded as multiple award, Indefinite- Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contracts to Concurrent Technologies Corporation (CTC), Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), InnovaSystems International, LLC (InnovaSystems), and Gryphon Technologies LC (Gryphon). This acquisition also incorporates a portion of work previously performed under N66001-13-D- 0044 and -0045 Defense Readiness Reporting System - Navy (DRRS-N) (specifically, the portion of work relates to the Navy Expeditionary Combat Command Readiness and Cost Reporting Program (RCRP) and the Aviation Maintenance Supply Readiness Reporting (AMSRR) system).
This acquisition also includes emerging requirements for systems engineering, software design/development, integration, testing, installation, training, life cycle maintenance, procurement support, help desk services, management support, and system documentation for GRFME which encompasses the (DRRS-S) and all systems reporting readiness data into the DRRS enterprise.
For this requirement, a market survey to determine small business capability was posted on SPAWAR E-Commerce Central on 27 April 2015, reference number SSC- Pacific_MKTSVY_11C262. Based upon evaluation of the responses to the market survey, SSC Pacific intends to compete the full scope of the requirement on an unrestricted basis (i.e., a full and open competition). Both large and small businesses can compete for the procurement.
The anticipated contract type will be Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee IDIQ with one two-year base period and one three-year option period. Subsequent Task Orders will be issued for individual efforts.
The estimated level of effort, based upon Full Time Equivalents (FTE's), will be approximately 79 per year in the 1st year and 135 FTE by the 5th year.  Each FTE is estimated to be 1,920 hours per year. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541330 and the Small Business Size Standard is $38.5M.
SSC Pacific anticipates that the final RFP for N66001-17-R-0169 will be released in December 2016. The final RFP will only be available electronically. Electronic copies of the RFP may be obtained from the SPAWAR E-Commerce website at https://e- commerce.spawar.navy.mil under SSC Pacific "Open Solicitations". Hard copy versions of the RFP and any subsequent amendments will not be available. Firms are encouraged to review the website regularly for important solicitation information.

<DESC><p>Sources Sought - Project Labor Agreement for the Construction of the Training Support Facility, Fort Lee, VA<br /><br />The Corps of Engineers Norfolk District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) for the following large scale (exceeding $25 Million) construction project: Training Support Facility, Fort Lee, VA</p>
<p>Project Description:<br />The Training Support Facility includes 120,214 square feet of classrooms, administrative areas, rest rooms, arms storage vault, and consolidated entry and reception area. The facility also includes climate controlled high-bay material storage and standard height material storage areas. Special foundations will be required. Supporting facilities include site development, utility connections, lighting, paving, parking, walks, curbs and gutters, storm drainage, information systems, landscaping and signage. Heating and air conditioning will be provided by self-contained system. Project will comply with anti-terrorism and force protection requirements per Unified Facilities Criteria at Fort Lee, Virginia.</p>
<p>Range of Magnitude: Between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000.</p>
<p>Period of Performance is approximately 540 calendar days after Notice to Proceed. Notice to Proceed is anticipated to occur during the first quarter of FY17.</p>
<p>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding PLA use are:</p>
<p>a. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades.<br />b. The complexity of the project<br />c. Shortage of skilled labor in the region<br />d. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.<br />e. The use of PLA's on other comparable projects in this geographic area.<br />f. The promotion of the Government's long term program interest such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.<br />g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion.<br />h. Additional costs form use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:</p>
<p>a. Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>b. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organization if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will:</p>
<p>a. Advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>b. Be consistent with law.</p>
<p>Reference: Provision 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement <br />Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Do you have knowledge that a PLA has been used in the local area on projects of this kind? If so, please provide supporting documentation.</p>
<p>2. Are you aware of skilled labor shortages in the area for those crafts that will be needed to complete the referenced project? Are there large scale construction projects in the area (over $25M, within 50 miles of Fort Lee, VA) which could impact availability of skilled labor for this project? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Please provide supporting documentation.</p>
<p>3. Are you aware of time sensitive issues/scheduling requirements that would impact the rate at which the referenced project should be completed? If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible.</p>
<p>4. Is the proposed schedule/completion time one which would benefit for a PLA - if so, how? Will a PLA impact the completion time? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>5. Are there any concerns regarding labor-management stability related to this project? Will the use of a PLA produce labor-management stability on this project? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? Are you aware of examples of labor-management conflicts in the area which could impact the efficiency of this project, which a PLA could positively impact/resolve?</p>
<p>6. Identify specific reasons why or how you believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement.</p>
<p>7. Identify specific reasons why you do not believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement.<br /><br />8. Please identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the use of a PLA on the referenced project.</p>
<p>9. Please identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the non-use of a PLA on the referenced project.</p>
<p>Please provide your comments via e-mail to Jaime C. Scott Howard, Contract Specialist at jaime.c.scott@usace.army.mil no later than 12:00 noon October 26th, 2016.</p>
<p>This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this market survey.</p>

TRUMAN (CVN 75) Planned Incremental Availability (PIA) at Norfolk Naval Shipyard from late 2016 to early 2017. This effort<br />will include planning, material procurement, fabrication, manpower, support services, design integration, engineering and management support, and technical data required to prepare for and accomplish this work during the availability. The work to be accomplished will include repair or replacement of shipboard nuclear support and propulsion systems, work within nuclear-controlled spaces, and work on specialized systems (e.g. catapults, arresting gear, aircraft elevators, etc.) that only the original shipbuilder has displayed the unique certifications,<br />capabilities, and expertise required.</p>

A sole source LRIP contract was awarded to NGC in September 2015 which included ESS. During the initial stages of LRIP production, NGC was authorized, under a technical instruction, to address and resolve observations from Initial Operational Testing and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) related to warfighter feedback and suitability improvements. The ESS hours needed to complete this tasking were more than anticipated at the time of contract award and used ESS hours initially planned for LRIP Lot 2 support. The LRIP Lot 2 option was awarded in July 2016 and the Navy's requirement for LRIP Lot 2 ESS remains unchanged.</span></p>
