<SOLNBR>0404RP33613
<RESPDATE>033004
<ARCHDATE>02092005
<CONTACT>Richard P.  Bolick Contract Specialist 7037871395     richard.bolick@mms.gov;
<DESC>This solicitation was previously synopsized under Reference Number RP33613A.  The US Department of Interior, through its Franchise Fund activity GovWorks, will manage the following procurement action on behalf of the US Department of Agriculture Risk Management Agency.  BACKGROUND.  Since 1938, the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) has developed and refined Federal crop insurance programs for many crops. Legislative modifications implemented in 1980 and 1996 gave FCIC authority to expand the availability of crop insurance. In 2003 FCIC offered Federal crop insurance programs for 362 crops with liability exceeding $40.5 billion and premium of $3.4 billion.  While the FCIC product offerings have been strong for major crops, products for pasture/rangeland, forage and hay have been inadequate. When all types of rangeland and pasture are considered, there are approximately 400 million acres in the United States and there is no regional focus on where most is located. There are an additional 65 million acres of hay harvested in the U.S. each year. For purposes of this solicitation, the full scope of these acreages is the target. There is a wide array of pasture/rangeland, forage and hay varieties, practices and types.  This can be illustrated by contrasting the differences between improved pastures that one might find in the eastern states to the unimproved rangeland in the western states that ranchers lease from the government. Further, some acreage is grazed under special conditions or harvested for hay in other years.  Producers in various regions often face unique and different problems. Those responding to this solicitation must account for these differences. They must identify and address relevant issues in their SOW. This means that tailored products shall be proposed. It does not mean the Offeror needs to be concerned with the entire spectrum of needs for livestock producers. Livestock producers include, but are not limited to, commercial cow/calf producers, seed stock producers, stockers/backgrounders, feeders, cattle ranchers, and dairy producers who utilize pasture/rangeland and produce forage and hay for their own use.  To date, RMA has had limited experience and success in developing insurance products for the wide array of forages and hay that are used by livestock. Typically, livestock producers do not keep adequate production records required for APH-type insurance products. RMA wants to identify and target these markets to pursue development of viable risk management products.  Currently, RMA provides coverage for rangeland under the Group Risk Plan (GRP) Rangeland Crop Insurance Pilot program in a limited number of Montana Counties. There is also an APH Forage program for alfalfa hay.  RMA is considering the development of a new pilot Pasture and Rangeland crop insurance program based on the use of a plant growth model.  RMA is aware that many producers of forage crops are not able to insure these crops under the existing (APH) Forage Production or GRP Forage Production Crop Insurance Programs. Therefore, RMA is seeking improvements to existing crop insurance programs and development of new and innovative approaches for providing improved forage coverage and risk management protection. OBJECTIVES:  The SOO for this program describes the basic, top-level objectives for developing a risk management program for pasture/rangeland and forage, and is provided in lieu of a Government written performance-based Statement of Work.  This approach provides potential Offerors the flexibility to develop cost effective and innovative solutions that meet the stated goals and objectives of this request for proposals.  RMA's goal is to obtain proposals which: (1) provide improvements to existing crop insurance programs specific to pasture, rangeland and forage; and/or (2) research and development of new, and potentially innovative crop insurance programs for pasture/rangeland, forage and hay, as defined in section 1.0 of the SOO, that is used for cattle.  Multiple proposals may be submitted and evaluated, and more than one award may be made.  A successful proposal submitted under this SOO will: improve the existing pasture, rangeland and forage crop insurance programs offered by RMA (APH Forage Production, GRP Forage Production, GRP Rangeland); or provide new and innovative approaches to insuring pasture/rangeland, forage and hay as defined in section 1.0 of the SOO.  To view the complete Statement of Objectives and proposal information, access www.govworks.gov/vendor/csolicit.asp; look up Solicitation Number 1435-04-04-RP-33613.  HOW TO RESPOND: In order to compete for this contract, interested parties must demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing, (A)  CAPABILITIES STATEMENT in accordance with the instructions in the SOO.   References will be checked. Capabilities Statements will be evaluated based on; (i) key personnel skills, abilities and experience; (ii) your organization's experience and (iii) past performance (including number, size, and complexity of similar projects), adherence to schedules and budgets, effectiveness of program management, willingness to cooperate when difficulties arise, general compliance with the terms of the contracts, and acceptability of delivered products. (B) A TECHNICAL PROPOSAL in accordance with the proposal instructions in the SOO.   (C) A COST PROPOSAL, which shall be a separate volume from the written portion of the Technical Proposal.  The Cost Proposal shall clearly indicate the proposed labor categories, hours, ODCs, travel, and material for this effort.  (D) The completed OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS per FAR subpart 52.212-3.  (E) VERIFICATION that the Offeror is currently registered in the Department of Defense Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  GovWorks shall make no award to unregistered contractors.  For details, see www.ccr.gov.  EVALUATION.  Please see the SOO document for the evaluation criteria and proposal preparation instructions. CONTRACT AWARD. Offerors shall include in their offers the type of contract being proposed.  The Government is open to consider various contracting vehicles, appropriate for the proposed Statements of Work.  Contract award(s) shall be made to the responsible Offeror(s) whose offer(s), in conforming to this RFP, provides an overall best value to the Government, technical evaluation factors and cost considered.  The Government's objective is to obtain the highest technical quality considered necessary to achieve the project objectives, with a realistic and reasonable cost.  Technical evaluation factors are more important than cost; however, between proposals that are evaluated as technically equal in quality, cost will become a major consideration in selecting the successful Offeror.  The Government reserves the right to make award(s) without discussions.  Please submit two (2) complete hard copy original offers and an electronic copy of all documents on CD or diskette in Microsoft Office format to the following address.  PROPOSALS ARE DUE BY 3:00 PM EST MARCH 30, 2004, AT DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR, MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE, MS 2500, 381 ELDEN STREET, HERNDON, VIRGINIA 20170, ATTENTION: RICHARD BOLICK.   Email copies of proposal documents will not be accepted.  Please note that MMS/Gov.Works is located in a secure building.  If offers are hand delivered, please ensure that the courier is instructed to use the courtesy phone in the rear of the lobby (to the right of the elevators) to call Procurement Operations on extension 1354.  A staff member will meet the courier to receive the submittal.  Please also send one hard copy and an electronic copy of the Capability Statement and Technical Proposal ONLY to the RMA POC: Stan Harkey, USDA Risk Management Agency, 6501 Beacon Drive, Kansas City, MO 64133.  Timeliness of proposal response shall be determined by time of receipt at the Herndon location.  Technical/business questions shall be sent via fax as soon as possible to: Richard Bolick, Fax (703) 787-1041 or by e-mail: Richard.Bolick@mms.gov. No questions are to be sent to RMA.   Please include with your question(s) your full name, the RFP number & title, your organization, complete address with telephone and fax numbers.  TELEPHONIC QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. In addition, RMA will host a pre-proposal conference for all potential Offerors at the RMA facility in Kansas City on March 2, 2004.  See the solicitation documents for more information and rsvp requirements.  The referenced provisions and clauses can be viewed at www.arnet.gov.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. FERC04C40034 is issued as a request for proposal and all provisions/clauses are those in effect through FAC 01-19. This solicitation is unrestricted under NAICS number 514330. 

Statement of Work: I. OBJECTIVE. The study will simulate and calibrate an hourly security constrained production cost model to accurately ìbackcastî historical generation output for a specified period of operation within the study area.  Once the model is calibrated to accurately reflect past utility operations, the model will then be used to predict the future year costs of service and to evaluate past years costs. The predictive model will use the model ìbackcastî assumptions as well as incorporating any and all planned additions to the system that would affect the cost of providing power within the study area.  This will constitute the benchmark for future costs within the study region.  The study will then relax the ìbackcastî assumptions to examine and compare how the cost of providing service within the study area would deviate from the benchmark under various changes or counterfactuals to the ìbackcastî assumptions.  Additionally, the study will examine how alternate market rules would affect the cost of service within the study area and will compare these costs to the benchmark costs

ï	II. SCOPE OF WORK.  The data (historical and forecasted) necessary to perform this study will include but is not limited to:

ï	Electricity loads by transmission off-take node (ideally hour-by-hour).
ï	Generating unit outputs, net of station use (ideally hour-by-hour).
ï	Generator outages, full and partial (ideally hour-by-hour).
ï	Transmission line outages by day (ideally hour-by-hour)
    
Other Generator or data for the benchmark period which typically do not change on a daily basis or hourly, are :

1.   Energy Imports and Exports from/to Neighboring Systems (ideally hour-by- hour). 
     
 2.  Generating unit output (MW) (ideally hour-by-hour).
      
 3.  Generating unit commitment status (cold, hot, delivering power) at Start-of-Year.

 4.  Variable generation fuel cost (i.e., inventory replacement or contract avoidable cost). 

 5.    Generating unit variable O&M cost.
 6.    Generating unit minimum load, ramp rates, minimum up and down times.

 7.   Generating unit startup costs.

In addition, the following control area security constraint data will be necessary:
 1.  Spinning reserve requirements.
 
  2.  Non-spinning reserve requirements.

  3.  Transmission line contingency loading constraints.
 
  4.  Reliability ìmust-runî requirements.

In creating the benchmark the successful bidder will be prepared to:

1.	Compare the simulated hourly dispatch from the model output with the actual dispatch from the hourly data.
2.	Develop a hypothesis explaining the deviations.
3.	Reconcile the deviations by adjusting the simulation results consistent with the hypothesis until the actual dispatch is replicated with sufficient precision.  
Acceptable methods for adjusting the dispatch would include but are not limited to:  
A.	The implementation of hurdle rates to restrict trade and competition.
B.	The implementation of non-competitive bidding behavior.
C.	The implementation of physical withholding strategies.
D.	The implementation of transmission withholding strategies.
Once the model is calibrated within an acceptable tolerance, the ìbackcastî assumptions will be implemented along with all planned system upgrades to create 5-year and 10-year benchmark production cost forecasts.  In addition to production costs, the study should document hourly locational marginal prices, emission costs, fuel transportation costs, and all other costs that would be affected by a change in dispatch, commitment, or market rules.
In creating the forward-looking cost comparison forecasts, the study will examine and document various market assumptions to illustrate how the cost of service would change should under each assumption.  The impact to rates should be documented as clearly as possible with capacity payments and stranded cost payments estimated for any displaced or replaced generation.   As clearly as possible, cost differences should be compared by type: fuel cost savings or increases; fuel transmission cost savings or increases; emission cost savings or increases; transmission upgrade cost savings or increases and locational marginal price reductions or increases, capacity payment savings or increases, stranded cost savings or increases, General and Administration (G&A) cost savings or increases, CAPX  savings or increases, etc.

III. DELIVERABLES.  - The draft and final report (which will include expert testimony on the findings, tables that present all findings and work papers to support the methodology) will provide detailed exposition for all assumptions and conclusions.  Final cost savings or increases will be presented in real dollars with the base year to be determined.  If expert testimony is required, a qualified witness must be prepared to offer testimony in all proceedings as determined by the Commission.  This proposal should not include costs associated with time and materials for trial testimony.  Intermediate deadlines for study deliverables will be determined prior to work beginning and all work will be expected to be completed within the timeframe agreed upon by Commission staff and the contract awardees

If possible, costs will be attributed to ratepayers to illustrate how rates would be affected under the various assumptions modeled.   All requested topics shall be discussed in the report, which shall be considered confidential until released by the FERC.  The contractor shall also complete and provide to the FERC staff an electronic copy of the report in Microsoft Word 2002 format.  Deliverables shall include a draft report, a briefing of FERC staff on the draft report, and a final report.  Throughout the study period, the contractor shall provide immediate notification to FERC staff of significant findings and important revelations.  The contractor will also be responsible for conducting weekly briefings with the FERC staff regarding the progress of the study.  Finally, the contractor will be available as an expert witness on behalf of the staff of the FERC in any hearings or meetings on the study.

<SUBJECT>A--Assessing Safety of Cell Substrates and Vaccine Components
<SOLNBR>NIH-NIAID-DMID-04-22
<RESPDATE>012204
<CONTACT>Paul McFarlane, Senior Contracting Officer, Phone 301-496-0349, Fax 301-402-0972, Email pm24v@nih.gov - Paul McFarlane, Senior Contracting Officer, Phone 301-496-0349, Fax 301-402-0972, Email pm24v@nih.gov
<DESC>The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has a requirement to solicits proposals for the development, characterization and validation of in vitro assays and in vivo animal models to assess the safety of cell substrates and vaccine components that are being considered for use in vaccine manufacturing.  The need for contemporary in vitro assays and in vivo animal models has arisen from 1) the development of vaccine candidates that can only be grown in cell substrates and/or require use of excipients or adjuvants that have not previously been used to manufacture licensed vaccines, and 2) previously unrecognized theoretical safety questions.  For example, few tests are available to specifically assess certain safety issues that are unique to new cell substrates.  These issues include tumorgenicity of the whole cell substrate, oncogenicity of the cellular DNA, and the detection of latent/occult adventitious agents in the cell substrate.  Experimental data are needed regarding these issues in order for manufacturers and regulatory agencies to meaningfully assess and analyze the safety of vaccines manufactured in these new cell substrates.  The focus of this RFP is to develop both in vitro assays and in vivo animal models to assess current and future safety concerns that arise regarding vaccines and vaccine manufacturing and/or formulation, including 1) assessing the tumorgenic potential of cell substrates; 2) assessing the oncogenic potential of cell substrate DNA; and 3) screening for latent/occult adventitious agents in cell substrates.              

This acquisition comprises five separate parts, each focusing on a specific area of in vitro assay development or in vivo animal model development:  Part A:  Develop, characterize and validate in vivo animal model(s) to assess tumorgenic potential of cell substrates.  Animal models will be developed to assess the tumorgenic potential of live cells themselves.   Part B:  Develop, characterize and validate in vitro assays to assess and characterize tumorgenic potential of cell substrates.  In vitro assays will be developed to assess the tumorgenic potential of live cells themselves.  In vitro assays will also be developed to identify markers of cellular immortalization/transformation.   Part C:  Develop, characterize and validate in vivo animal models to analyze the oncogenic potential of cellular DNA.  Animal models will be developed to assess the risk of cell substrate DNA itself having oncogenic potential.  Part D:  Develop, characterize and validate in vitro assays to analyze the oncogenic potential of cellular DNA.  In vitro assays will be developed to assess the risk of cell substrate DNA itself having oncogenic potential.  
Part E:  Develop, characterize and validate assays for detection of novel or latent/occult adventitious agents in cell substrates.  Assays will be developed to screen for infectious agents that are not detected by currently used adventitious agent tests.  This will include development of assays to assess the potential for cell substrates to harbor and transmit TSEs.

Additionally, Offerors may propose a single in vivo animal model, multiple in vivo animal models, a single in vitro assay or multiple in vitro assays for each Part of this solicitation.  However, each proposed animal model and/or assay must be tested using two cell substrates.

The development process for both in vitro assays and in vivo animal models will consist of two stages.  The first stage will be to determine the general feasibility, utility and sensitivity of the in vitro assay and in vivo animal model.  Upon completion of the first stage, the results will be analyzed, and those in vitro assays and in vivo animal models deemed promising by the government will be selected for validation ñ the second stage of development.  Validation will be conducted in accordance with the most current U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidelines.  Links to the most current information concerning validation can be found on the FDA website http://www.fda.gov/, and the ICH website http://www.ich.org/ich5.html.

To the extent possible, efforts should focus on applying existing technologies, reagents, techniques, and animal strains to animal model development.  For example, proposals to develop assays for in vitro analysis of the oncogenic potential of live cells could include a more thorough development and validation effort of the currently used growth in soft agar assay.  

The use of currently available animal strains, rather than the development of new animal strains (i.e., new knockout mice) is strongly encouraged.  Furthermore, it is expected that the animals used in model development will be rodent models, such as mouse, rat or hamster.  However, proposals to use other types of animals, either rodent of non-rodent, will be acceptable and considered.

Offerors may respond to any or all of Parts A, B, C, D, and E; however, a separate technical and business proposal must be submitted for each Part.   Tasks encompassed under Parts B and D, including validation, must be completed within thirty-six (36) months from the date of award.  Tasks encompassed under Parts A, C, and E, including validation, must be completed within sixty (60) months from the date of award.  

This acquisition has total available funding in the amount $3,000,000 per year for all contracts awarded under this solicitation.  It is anticipated that two to five (2-5) cost-reimbursement, completion type contracts  will be awarded for a three to five (3-5) year period, beginning on or about September 30, 2004.  RFP NIH-NIAID-DMID-04-22 will be available electronically on or about October 20, 2003, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Branch (CMB) Home page by using the following electronic address and instructions:

Please note that the RFP for this acquisition only includes the work statement, deliverable and reporting requirements, special requirements, the technical evaluation criteria, and the proposal preparation instructions and provisions.  All information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in the electronic RFP package.  Following proposal submission and the initial review process, offerors comprising the competitive range will be requested to provide additional documentation to the Contracting Officer.  

Responses to this RFP will be due approximately January 22, 2004.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.  See Government wide Numbered Note 26.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Air Resources Lab/Field Research Division (ARL/FRD),  proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with airborne Research Australia, 60 Dakota Drive, Salisbury South, SA, Australia 5106 to provide a total of 60 flight hours using the ECO-Dimona and the Grob 109B aircrafts.****NOAA requires measurements of temperature, turbulence and radar signal strength in and around Adelaide, Australia in April and May 2004.  Two aircraft, specially instrumented with the NOAA BAT probe and fast temperature probe (FUST) are required to fly 60 research hours (30 each) in and around Adelaide to measure effects of inversions and naturally occurring index of refraction gradients/refractive turbulence on radar wave propagation.  One aircraft will be outfitted with a radar transmitter supplied by the Defense Science & Technology Organization (DTSO) of Australia and will fly above the inversion layer.  The other will be outfitted with a radar receiver (also supplied by DTSO) and will collect data on signal strength that can be further related to microwave propagation. These data will be used to characterize the inversion layer and the regions directly above and below and relate the atmospheric conditions to microwave propagation. This is a joint project between the Air Force Research Laboratory, NOAA, and the (DTSO) of Australia.  Airborne Research Australia is the only group having multiple aircraft equipped with BAT probes and fast temperature sensors able to meet the above requirements.**** This simplified acquisition (NTE $100K) is being conducted under the authority of FAR Part 13.  No solicitation is available.  Responses to this notice must be received no later than March 2, 2004 and will be evaluated solely to determine if a competitive procurement process will be in the Governmentís best interest.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   EPA is seeking small businesses capable of providing the services described  below.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL OR COST PROPOSAL.  This is a request for a technical capability statement from small businesess capable of  providing a training workshop to 20-30 EPA staff on the use of ecological population modeling in ecological risk assessments for hazardous waste sites.  The technical statement shall not exceed 3 single-spaced pages.  The training workshop will address the following 6 modules.   1).  Introduction to population modeling.  This module should  provide trainees with a basic understanding of the theory, concepts and approaches available for modeling populations of wildlife, plants and acquatic life.  Our intention is to focus on the specific considerations, methodological options, and decision criteria that are unique to population-level  assessments.  2). Review of available data.  This module should survey the range of available population modeling approaches, from simple, heuristic models with few assumptions and data needs, to complex situationally-dependent models that require detailed knowledge of the species and spatal  context within which the model is applied.  Population models that can use the results of toxicity tests to predict population growth rate, age structure, and other population-level attributes, as well as metapopulation and spatially-explicit indivudal based models that yield predictions of  population abundance in time and space must be addressed.  3).  Data Requirements.  This module should address the informational requirements of the models described in Moudule #2 and describe laboraory and field-based methods for obtaining required data.  4).  This module should describe how  uncertainty and variability in model input parameters can be addressed using models that incorporate stochasticity, and sensitivity analyses that can be used to focus additional research efforts on reducing uncertainties in the most important variables.  It should also describe approaches for  communicating uncertainty in model output.  5).  This module should present methods for estimating population-level response and quantifying variability from stress-response relationships derived from toxicity tests or field gradient analyses.  It should include descriptions of the types of  information needed and methods available for understanding population-level effects in heterogeneous landscapes.  6).  Hands-on demonstration for meeting participants.  This module should provide hands-on demonstration for 20-30 participants at the vendor's facilities or a site to accommodate 20-30  participants in Washington, DC or Reserch Triangle Park, North Carolina. The technical capability statement must also include a brief description on experience in conducting courses on Ecology Population Modeling.  The contractor  is expected to be prepared to provide the training within 1 to 2  months after award of the Purchase Order.  Prospective small businesses shall submit 2 copies of their technical capability statement not later than 02/20/04 to:  Jennifer T. Johnson (3803R), U.S. EPA, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20460.  Telephonic responses will not be honored.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with California Analytical Instruments for a Photoacoustic Multi-Gas Analyzer with Optical filters under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1.  This requirement for the ORD/NHSRC will utilize FAR Parts 12 and 13, Commercial and Simplified Acquisition Procedures.   This acquisition is for One (1) Photoacoustic Multi-Gas Analyzer, One (1) Calibrated Optical Filter to measure dimethyl methyl phosphate (DMMP), One (1) Calibrated Optical Filter to measure chloroethyl ethyl sulfate (CEES), One (1) Calibrated  Optical Filter to measure hydrogen chloride (HCl), One (1) Calibrated Optical Filter to measure Chlorobenzene, and One (1) Calibrated Optical Filter to measure Ethylene Glycol, that will measure gas phase concentrations of chemical agent surrogates.  It has been determined that California  Analytical Instruments is the only firm able to provide the Gas Analyzer and Calibrated Optical Filters due to the need for a rack mounted instrument that can be integrated with a multipoint sampling interface and has analog output while simultaneously measuring DMMP, CEES, HCl, HBr, Chlorobenzene,  and Ethylene Glycol and correcting for water vapor.  NHSRC requires an instrument that limits false positive readings by utilization of a narrow band of optical filters to prevent absorption of interfering compounds which may cause a false positive signal.  NHSRC requires a low volume sampling and  low volume flushing (less than 0.1 liters per sample) which is needed due to the limited flow rates of a reactor and the low ppb to mid ppm detection level of compounds needing to be detected.  NHSRC also requires low zero and a span drift of less than 2.5% of reading over 3 months which is needed  for consistency of results.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.  However, any firm believing itself capable of providing the required components may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of delivering this equipment.  Such documentation must be submitted to the POC  within 7 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses received will normally be considered solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@tda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place: The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the Sukulu Hills Phosphate Project.

MISA, through its Ugandan subsidiary Nilefos Minerals Limited, plans to establish an industrial complex based on a large deposit of phosphate rock at Sukulu Hills.  This site has a deposit of in excess of 200 million tons of phosphate-bearing soils that have resulted from the weathering of a volcanic intrusion.  The intrusion rises above the local countryside.  Component One is the subject of the present request and involves the re-sampling and recalculation of the available phosphate mineral resource and the presentation of the data generated in a format that will ensure a level of confidence required by the lenders and equity investors including the standards required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  In addition, the selected U.S. Study contractor will investigate the feasibility of applying new technology and optimizing the beneficiation process where not considered in previous studies.  As part of this work, the contractor will operate a pilot plant on site to provide sufficient rock concentrate for test work.  Tailor-made processes will be developed for beneficiation to optimize costs.  This testing will also determine the suitability of the rock concentrate for making various grades of phosphoric acid and other potential products.  These products would also be supplied to potential customers of the concentrate itself for determining the suitability of the rock concentrate for use in their plants.

Nilefos Minerals Limited, an affiliate of the Madhvani Group of Companies in Uganda, is the Project Sponsor.  Nilefos was established to develop this project and is owned by The Madhvani Group.  Nilefos obtained the exclusive prospecting license in May 2002, and 19 square kilometers of land is earmarked for mining and processing the available phosphate.  Nilefos operates as a corporate body under the leadership of its President Mr. Nitin Jayant Madhvani.

The current portion of the study, Component One, will consist of plant beneficiation and design feasibility work that is considered important to lock in the U.S. content of the whole project.  The final work product of Component One would consist of drawings for the plant design including specifications for each piece of equipment to be used and electrical line diagrams, and a plan for working the mine with the sizes and quantities of equipment required.  The report would be refined to a level of confidence that would meet the requirements of regulatory bodies.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $360,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).  In addition, Madhvani International SA has committed to fund $240,000 of the study for a total contract value of $600,000.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firmís name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 12 noon, March 31, 2004 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The United States Department of Agriculture(USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), in conjunction with New York officials, requires four (3) firm-fixed price requirements contracts for the application of a systemic insecticide (Imidacloprid) for control of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplphora glabripennis (Motschulsky) in the Manhattan, Brooklyn, West Queens, East Queens and Long Island areas of the State of New York.  During the spring of 2004, APHIS anticipates applying control treatments to approximately 113,000 host trees with an estimated 1,400,000 diameter at breast height (dbh)  via trunk injection, estimated 23,000 host trees with an estimated 292,000 dbh via soil injection and 1,300 host trees with an estimated 5,200 dbh via soil drench total in all contract areas.  Control treatment applications are intended to reduce the potential for damage from this major pest of trees.   ALB bores into and kills a variety of tree species including, but not limited to, species of Elm, Maple, Birch, Willow, Box Elder, Horsechestnut, Buckeye, European Mountain Ash, Ash, Poplar, Albizza and London Plane.  This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture had declared an emergency for the eradication of ALB in the areas identified.  Control treatments must be completed prior to adult emergence and flight which begins in late spring and early summer.  Therefore, all projected control treatments must be applied by mid August of 2004.  Requirements contracts will be awarded to ensure contractual coverage is in place in the event additional control treatment applications are required or PPQ decides to apply control treatments in the fall of 2004.  The effective period of the contract is anticipated from mid March 2004, or date of award, through September 30, 2004, with unilateral four options to extend the effective period of each contract awarded.  The solicitation is expected to be issued on or about January 30, 2004, with proposals due to the Contracting Officer 3 weeks thereafter.  SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS BY FAX IS PROHIBITED.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis, however, award preference will be provided to companies qualified under the Small Business Administration HUBZone and Section 8(a) programs and other small and small disadvantaged businesses.  NAICS Code:  115310, Size Standard:  $5.0 million dollar average annual receipts.  Telephone requests for a copy of the RFP will not be honored.

<DESC>TO DOWNLOAD A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION PACKAGE FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING SOLICITATION NOS.: 008, 009, 010, 011 -M-APHIS-04, GO TO SOLICITATION NO. 008-M-APHIS-04.  The United States Department of Agriculture(USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), in conjunction with New York officials, requires four (3) firm-fixed price requirements contracts for the application of a systemic insecticide (Imidacloprid) for control of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplphora glabripennis (Motschulsky) in the Manhattan, Brooklyn, West Queens, East Queens and Long Island areas of the State of New York.  During the spring of 2004, APHIS anticipates applying control treatments to approximately 113,000 host trees with an estimated 1,400,000 diameter at breast height (dbh)  via trunk injection, estimated 23,000 host trees with an estimated 292,000 dbh via soil injection and 1,300 host trees with an estimated 5,200 dbh via soil drench total in all contract areas.  Control treatment applications are intended to reduce the potential for damage from this major pest of trees.   ALB bores into and kills a variety of tree species including, but not limited to, species of Elm, Maple, Birch, Willow, Box Elder, Horsechestnut, Buckeye, European Mountain Ash, Ash, Poplar, Albizza and London Plane.  This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture had declared an emergency for the eradication of ALB in the areas identified.  Control treatments must be completed prior to adult emergence and flight which begins in late spring and early summer.  Therefore, all projected control treatments must be applied by mid August of 2004.  Requirements contracts will be awarded to ensure contractual coverage is in place in the event additional control treatment applications are required or PPQ decides to apply control treatments in the fall of 2004.  The effective period of the contract is anticipated from mid March 2004, or date of award, through September 30, 2004, with unilateral four options to extend the effective period of each contract awarded.  The solicitation is expected to be issued on or about January 30, 2004, with proposals due to the Contracting Officer 3 weeks thereafter.  SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS BY FAX IS PROHIBITED.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis, however, award preference will be provided to companies qualified under the Small Business Administration HUBZone and Section 8(a) programs and other small and small disadvantaged businesses.  NAICS Code:  115310, Size Standard:  $5.0 million dollar average annual receipts.  Telephone requests for a copy of the RFP will not be honored.

<DESC>This NOCA does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP) nor an Invitation for Bids (IFB). It does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach nor should the Government construe it as a commitment.  Furthermore, potential offerors are reminded and cautioned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.  The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor will it reimburse the contractor for costs, if any, associated with this NOCA.  This NOCA constitutes an announcement to all potential offerors that the Tactical Data Links (TDL), Gateways, and Network Management System Program Office (TGN SPO), Network Management Division (NI3N), Electronic Systems Center, Hanscom AFB, MA  01731 intends to issue on or about 8 March, 2004 a Request for Proposals  (RFP) (RFP Number: FA8725-04-R-0004) for the Joint Interface Control Officer (JICO) Support System (JSS). The TGN SPO, along with its partner organizations intends to conduct a full and open competition utilizing FAR Part 15 and best value evaluation criteria for the acquisition. The overall objective of JSS program is to provide support to the Joint Interface Control Officer (JICO) and JICO Cell with an Automated Tool Set for Planning, Management, and Execution of the Multi-TADIL Network (MTN), automated Track Data Management, TDL Coordination and Management and Voice and Data Communications. The JSS will be acquired through a three-phased effort.  Phase 1 is anticipated to consist a six-month effort to develop an EDM (Engineering Development Model) unit for JSS with minimal implementation of requirements, which will be listed in the TRD.  Cost for Phase 1 will be based on a firm fixed-pricing.  Phase 2 will consist of the completion of the development of the unit with all threshold requirements on a cost-plus-award fee basis.  Phase 3 will consist of production on a firm fixed-price basis and sustainment on a time-and-materials basis. Selection of Phase 1 contractors is expected to result in award of two (2) or three (3) contracts, with down-selection to one contractor for Phases 2 and 3.   Initial proposals will be submitted using a split submission process.  The Government reserves the right to award more, less, or no contracts at all depending on the quality of the proposals received.  The government reserves the right to award without discussion. Each offeror selected for Phase 1 contract award will be required to deliver (DD Form 250) two (2) complete Phase 1 units with critical sparing at the end of a 6 month time frame based on the requirements for Phase 1.  The government will use these units during a demonstration/training (accomplished by the contractor) and evaluation phase (accomplished by the government). Each offeror will also be required to submit (upon delivery of the EDM units listed in Phases 1); a complete proposal; e.g. any final change pages to its technical proposal, and a full cost proposal based on the final version of its technical proposal after the development phase of Phase 1 and before the oral/demonstration and evaluation. Information exchanges and associated acquisition history of JSS are posted to the ESC HANSCOM AFB, MA electronic bulletin board (https://herbb.hanscom.af.mil) and the Government Point of Entry (GPE), FedBizOps (http://www.fedbizopps.gov).  Potential offerors shall monitor HERBB and/or the GPE for future information exchanges and the anticipated RFP.  Offerors will be provided 30 days from official release to respond to the RFP.  Telephone requests for the RFP will not be accepted. Firms responding to the RFP shall indicate whether they are a large business, small business, very small business, small-disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned business, HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business, or service-disabled veteran-owned small business.  The applicable North American Industrial Classification system (NAICS) code is  334220. Respondents must specify whether they are a U.S. or foreign-owned firm. Interested Contractors desiring to do business with the Air Force shall be registered in the DoD Central Contracting Reporting System.  Interested offerors who have Advisory and Assistance Services contracts and also support ESC/TGN are put on notice that the potential for an Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) may exist. If an offeror desires to submit a proposal in response to the above RFP, an OCI mitigation plan will be required. This plan will be evaluated to determine if an actual OCI exists and whether sufficient safeguards exist that render the offeror eligible for award. Under some circumstances, an OCI mitigation plan may not be sufficient to correct an OCI, so submitting an OCI mitigation plan does not guarantee that a company will be successful in mitigating an OCI. Failure to submit such a plan when an OCI is present will render the offeror ineligible for award. Similarly, failure to mitigate an OCI will also render an offeror ineligible for award.  Offerors are requested to submit an OCI mitigation plan, if appropriate, to the contracting officer prior to RFP release. Offerors are requested to submit past performance information 15 days prior to the date set for receipt of proposals. Please direct any questions on this NOCA to ESC/TGN, 45 Arnold Street, Hanscom AFB MA 01731-2103, Attn: Mr. Kent Kinal, Contracting Officer (tel: 781-377-1273, e-mail: kent.kinal@hanscom.af.mil) or Mr. Jeff Wong, Contracts Manager (tel: 781-377-2326, e-mail: Jeffrey.wong@hanscom.af.mil).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Request for Proposal number is N62645-04-R-0003.  Provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-16 are incorporated.  NAICS 423450.  Naval Medical Logistics Command has the following requirement for a ceiling mounted medical examination light.  The resulting contract will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract with a 3-year ordering period containing a minimum for 22 units and a maximum of 500.  The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate with Offerors on an open competition basis to procure ceiling mounted medical examination lights for Navy ships of the line.  Offerors are required to forward proposal and technical documentation by  21 Jan 04. 

Technical evaluations will be conducted in three stages. Stage 1 is compliance with minimum salient essential characteristics. Stage 2 will be the evaluation of Past Performance information and a confirmation of a complete pricing proposal. Stage 3 will be the shipboard installation and demonstration of the product and the evaluation of the pricing proposal. The Technical Proposal shall address all the minimum salient characteristics.  The Government will not assume that the offeror possesses any capability unless it is specified in the proposal. Proposals should include Past Performance Information from three sources to include: 1.) Agency name; 2.) Agency point of contact and telephone number; 3.) Contract number; 4.) Type and number of units provided; and 5.) Delivery and Performance Information (Contract delivery schedules and actual delivery schedules.) 6.) Quality (Total number of units submitted for inspection and total number rejected.)  Proposals should include Pricing on the following items: 1.) Ceiling mounted medical examination light and 2.) Complete installation to make unit fully operational.  Information on the existing mount can be requested via email to Wendy Graybill at wlgraybill@nmlc.med.navy.mil.  Pricing proposals shall include copies of published commercial price lists, or other documentation setting forth the prices charged to the general public for same or similar items. The Government will make award to the responsible offeror submitting the proposal that is determined most advantageous to the Government, cost and other factors considered.  The evaluation of proposals will be based on an evaluation of the technical and price proposals submitted by each offeror and the shipboard installation and demonstration.  The technical evaluation factors are significantly more important than cost.  In the event that two or more technical proposals are determined not to have any substantial technical differences, the award may be made to the lower price proposal.  It should be noted that award may be made to other than the low offeror.  Award may also be made on the basis of initial offers without discussions.  Therefore, offerors are cautioned that each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms.  Failure to submit any information requested would result in a determination that the technical or pricing proposal is incomplete and the offeror may not be considered further for award. Technical evaluation will be done in two stages.  Each offer must document compliances in Stage 1 before proceeding to Stage 2. Offerors providing acceptable results from Stage 2 will proceed to Stage 3. 
    
Stage 1: The technical documentation will be compared to the essential minimum salient characteristics and the evaluation factors listed below. Salient characteristics will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis.  The requirement is for a ceiling mounted medical examination light that has the following essential minimum salient characteristics: 1.) Shall be a ceiling mounted medical examination light; 2.) Shall have a minimum 150 degrees of rotation about the extension arm; 3.) Shall have a minimum of 60 degrees of rotation about the yoke; 4.) Shall have a minimum of 90 degrees of rotation about the vertical support of the lighthead; 5.) The light color shall be within 15% of 4500 degrees Kelvin; 6.) Shall have a minimum illuminance of 50,000 Lux; 7.) The focal range shall start at a minimum of 24 inches and not extend past 50 inches from the lighthead; 8.) The lighthead shall not cause a temperature rise of more than 4oC; 9.) The lighthead shall have a minimum rating of 500 hours on the light source; 10.) Shipís power will be supplied to the product at 120 VAC. In addition to the above mentioned essential characteristics, the proposal shall state that the ceiling mounted medical examination light shall be capable of passing the following tests: 1.) High Temperature (Operational) - The test items will be placed in the chamber at 120oF, and the operational component is accomplished by cycling the lights on and off once per hour for 8 hours; 2.) High Temperature (Storage) - The test items will be placed in the chamber at 120oF for 24 hours.  The systems will be removed from the chamber and operated to determine if they function; 3.) Low Temperature (Operational) - The test items will be placed in the chamber at 40oF, and the operational component is accomplished by cycling the lights on and off once per hour for 8 hours; 4.) Low Temperature (Storage) -The test items will be placed in the chamber at -60oF for 24 hours. The systems will be removed from the chamber and operated to determine if they function; 5.) Humidity - Temperature will be set to 120oF and humidity was set to 90%.  The test items will be placed in the chamber for 8 hours. The systems will be removed from the chamber and operated to determine if they function; and 6.) Vibration - The test items will be placed on a single axis vibration table.  The test items will be exposed to the MIL-STD 810E, Method 514.4 vibration signature (copies available) for 30 minutes.  This vibration profile is a composite of what the military believes the equipment will be subjected to.  They will be removed from the table and operated to determine if they function.

Stage 2 will consist of a comparative evaluation of past performance information encompassing subfactors 1) Similar Work, 2) Delivery and 3) Quality and a confirmation of a complete pricing proposal. 

Stage 3: The offerors who provide acceptable proposals based on criteria above will be requested to demonstrate their products on 29 Jan 04 at the Naval Sea Systems Command in Norfolk, VA. at no expense to the Government.  Demonstration shall consist of the following parameters: 1.) Offerors will be limited to three personnel to represent their company; 2.) The Offerors will be given one hour to demonstrate their products. The demonstration will be used to evaluate the time and tools needed to install and make the light operational within a shipboard environment and meet minimum requirements in Stage 1 (items 1-10). Offerors will be further evaluated in the area of pricing. Pricing proposals will be evaluated based on the following factors, Completeness, Reasonableness and Realism. 

A determination of award will then be made to the offeror who has demonstrated a product that represents the best value to the Government. After award the contractor will provide a sample of their medical examination light for acceptance testing. The Government will test the sample to determine compliance with all the characteristics listed in Stage 1 of this solicitation for survival within the shipboard environment.  Samples shall be 1.) Submitted at no expense to the Government; and 2.) Returned at the Contractors request and expense, which may be damaged during testing. Failure to meet the acceptance testing will result in a Termination of the contract and subsequent award to the next ranked vendor.

Questions received for Solicitation Number N62645-04-R-0003, Ceiling Mounted Medical Examination Lights

1) Are the lights to be used strictly as Exam Lights?
Yes.

2) Are there existing support structures installed in the ships to which the lights are to be attached, and if so, are the supports identical from ship to ship? Also we need complete details on the support structures (including dimensions), in addition to the adapter plate detail received.
The support structure is different for each ship and different for each space.  The adapter plate will allow interface with the base plate of any one of the mounts.  I have drawings of the more than 20 different support structures.  They vary in length and angle, this should only change the amount of wiring needed to complete the install.

3) The following dimensional information is required:
∑ The total interstitial space dimension between the finished ceiling and the structural ceiling above it.
∑ The dimension from the bottom of the existing support structure and the finished ceiling. 
∑ The dimension of floor to finished ceiling.
∑ A detail of any obstructions connected to the ceiling which could interfere with the operation and movement of the lights.

4) During the demo phase, will we install our lights aboard a ship, a facsimile of a ship or do we need to provide our own facsimile to demonstrate installation?
One of the requirements during the demo was that the vendor install their light into a real ship in the Norfolk areaample of all of the different mounts on one ship.  I don't think it is possible to obtain all of the drawings of all of the mounts for all of the ships in the Navy.

4) Is there a DC current capability back-up required? 

No.

5) During the demo phase, will we install our lights aboard a ship, a facsimile of a ship or do we need to provide our own facsimile to demonstrate installation?

One of the requirements during the demo was that the vendor install their light into a real ship in the Norfolk area.

6) I am inclined to assume the wiring is already installed and available for our lights to be wired to the existing 120v. However it is a question I need to know for sure.

The base of the light is wired on all ships for these installations.

7) Do we need to quote conduit or is that in place as well?

All conduit is in place on all ships for these installations.

8) Will all the installations of the medical lights over the duration of the contract be performed in the Norfolk area?

We will need the lights installed where the ships port.  Norfolk is one of the many areas.  San Diego is another, and there are several ship yards along the Gulf Coast of the U.S. (Pascagoula, MS, New Orleans, LA, etc.). 

9)  Should shipping be included in the price quote? If so, will all lights be shipped to the same place?  

Shipping probably should be included in the pricing.  They can line item it so that the comparisons are oranges to oranges.

Offerors providing acceptable results from Stage 2 will proceed to Stage 3. 
    
Stage 1: The technical documentation will be compared to the essential minimum salient characteristics and the evaluation factors listed below. Salient characteristics will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis.  The requirement is for a ceiling mounted medical examination light that has the following essential minimum salient characteristics: 1.) Shall be a ceiling mounted medical examination light; 2.) Shall have a minimum 150 degrees of rotation about the extension arm; 3.) Shall have a minimum of 60 degrees of rotation about the yoke; 4.) Shall have a minimum of 90 degrees of rotation about the vertical support of the lighthead; 5.) The light color shall be within 15% of 4500 degrees Kelvin; 6.) Shall have a minimum illuminance of 50,000 Lux; 7.) The focal range shall start at a minimum of 24 inches and not extend past 50 inches from the lighthead; 8.) The lighthead shall not cause a temperature rise of more than 4oC; 9.) The lighthead shall have a minimum rating of 500 hours on the light source; 10.) Shipís power will be supplied to the product at 120 VAC. In addition to the above mentioned essential characteristics, the proposal shall state that the ceiling mounted medical examination light shall be capable of passing the following tests: 1.) High Temperature (Operational) - The test items will be placed in the chamber at 120oF, and the operational component is accomplished by cycling the lights on and off once per hour for 8 hours; 2.) High Temperature (Storage) - The test items will be placed in the chamber at 120oF for 24 hours.  The systems will be removed from the chamber and operated to determine if they function; 3.) Low Temperature (Operational) - The test items will be placed in the chamber at 40oF, and the operational component is accomplished by cycling the lights on and off once per hour for 8 hours; 4.) Low Temperature (Storage) -The test items will be placed in the chamber at -60oF for 24 hours. The systems will be removed from the chamber and operated to determine if they function; 5.) Humidity - Temperature will be set to 120oF and humidity was set to 90%.  The test items will be placed in the chamber for 8 hours. The systems will be removed from the chamber and operated to determine if they function; and 6.) Vibration - The test items will be placed on a single axis vibration table.  The test items will be exposed to the MIL-STD 810E, Method 514.4 vibration signature (copies available) for 30 minutes.  This vibration profile is a composite of what the military believes the equipment will be subjected to.  They will be removed from the table and operated to determine if they function.

Stage 2 will consist of a comparative evaluation of past performance information encompassing subfactors 1) Similar Work, 2) Delivery and 3) Quality and a confirmation of a complete pricing proposal. 

Stage 3: The offerors who provide acceptable proposals based on criteria above will be requested to demonstrate their products on 29 Jan 04 at the Naval Sea Systems Command in Norfolk, VA. at no expense to the Government.  Demonstration shall consist of the following parameters: 1.) Offerors will be limited to three personnel to represent their company; 2.) The Offerors will be given one hour to demonstrate their products. The demonstration will be used to evaluate the time and tools needed to install and make the light operational within a shipboard environment and meet minimum requirements in Stage 1 (items 1-10). Offerors will be further evaluated in the area of pricing. Pricing proposals will be evaluated based on the following factors, Completeness, Reasonableness and Realism. 

A determination of award will then be made to the offeror who has demonstrated a product that represents the best value to the Government. After award the contractor will provide a sample of their medical examination light for acceptance testing. The Government will test the sample to determine compliance with all the characteristics listed in Stage 1 of this solicitation for survival within the shipboard environment.  Samples shall be 1.) Submitted at no expense to the Government; and 2.) Returned at the Contractors request and expense, which may be damaged during testing.

Questions received for Solicitation Number N62645-04-R-0003, Ceiling Mounted Medical Examination Lights

1) Are the lights to be used strictly as Exam Lights?

Yes.

2) Are there existing support structures installed in the ships to which the lights are to be attached, and if so, are the supports identical from ship to ship? Also we need complete details on the support structures (including dimensions), in addition to the adapter plate detail received.

The support structure is different for each ship and different for each space.  The adapter plate will allow interface with the base plate of any one of the mounts.  I have drawings of the more than 20 different support structures.  They vary in length and angle, this should only change the amount of wiring needed to complete the install.

3) The following dimensional information is required:
∑ The total interstitial space dimension between the finished ceiling and the structural ceiling above it.
∑ The dimension from the bottom of the existing support structure and the finished ceiling. 
∑ The dimension of floor to finished ceiling.
∑ A detail of any obstructions connected to the ceiling which could interfere with the operation and movement of the lights.

The support structure is different for each ship and different for each space.  The adapter plate will allow interface with the base plate of any one of the mounts.  I have drawings of more than 20 different support structures.  They vary in length and angle and are only a s.
5) I am inclined to assume the wiring is already installed and available for our lights to be wired to the existing 120v. However it is a question I need to know for sure.
The base of the light is wired on all ships for these installations.
6) Do we need to quote conduit or is that in place as well?
All conduit is in place on all ships for these installations.

<ARCHDATE>05182004
<CONTACT>Timothy F. Boyd, 916-557-5226
<DESC>Sources Sought/Notice of Intent to Negotiate with One Source. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Kennedy/Jenks Consultants, Inc., the current onboard designer for the San Juan W ater District Sponsor to perform design efforts associated with the Hydraulic Improvements to the existing San Juan Water Districts SJWD The District water treatment plant WTP associated with the Regional Water Conservation and Recycling Project in Granite  Bay, CA. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Kennedy/Jenks Consultants, Inc. under authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, unless, as a result of analysis o f acceptable responses to this notice, a determination is made by the Government to issue a competitive solicitation. The Sacramento District Corps of Engineers, The Corps, is seeking to identify sources that are uniquely qualified to design the WTP s hydr aulic improvements. The WTP was designed and constructed in the early 1970s by Clendenen and Associates Engineers. As a result of the excellent performance of the water treatment plant WTP using the Clendenen process, it will continue to be used by the Dis trict into the foreseeable future. The Clendenen design was never developed commercially, therefore the SJWD WTP represents a one of a kind facility. Kennedy/Jenks Consultants, Inc. completed the Districts Wholesale Water Master Plan during years 2000 and 2001. This comprehensive document has been the guide for subsequent WTP planning efforts, including the Hydraulic Improvements. The master plan was also the basis for the design and construction of several improvements to the WTP to increase reliability an d treatment capacity. Kennedy/Jenks Consultants, Inc. performed this subsequent planning and Design work. They have invested many hours in learning and understanding the Clendenen design, including conducting field reconnaissance and WTP investigations to validate desktop evaluations, and developing system models and performance analyses on behalf of the District. The development of the Wholesale Water Master Plan, and the design and improvements to the WTP provides Kennedy/Jenks Consultants with the unique  knowledge and qualifications to provide engineering and design services for the proposed Hydraulic Improvements. During the Wholesale Water Master Planning effort, Kennedy/Jenks utilized a specialized hydraulic model along with extensive field investigati ons and surveys of the Districts WTP, to identify several areas where hydraulic and process improvements were needed to optimize use of the WTP. Several of their recommended improvements have been implemented. These improvements and Kennedy/Jenks model sho uld be updated with the current WTP configuration and calibrated with actual field measurements to allow proper          planning of the proposed extensive Hydraulic Improvements. Kennedy/Jenks unique model cannot be duplicated in a timely, economic fashio n, and again, makes Kennedy/Jenks Consultants, Inc. uniquely qualified to perform the work. In addition to the technical qualifications, Kennedy/Jenks Consultants, Inc. has developed a professional rapport with the State of California Department of Health Services (DHS) and have demonstrated their knowledge and understanding of the Districts unique WTP process, fostering DHS confidence in the design, filter configuration and performance of the Districts WTP. Kennedy/Jenks continued team building and interac tion with DHS is critical for obtaining DHS buy-in and amending the Districts DHS water supply permit to ensure success of the proposed project. The most distinctive feature of the Districts WTP is the design of the filter system. The filter media profile,  consisting of graded gravels, silica sand, and carefully specified anthracite, is similar to the typical design of a convention al WTP. However, the filter bas in design, underdrain design, and filter backwashing system utilizing dual-drive, up-flow modular filter backwashing units with hydraulic surface wash injectors is the only one of its kind in the world. Any work at the plant must be designed to allow the f acilities to stay in operation during construction, and not affect the quality or quantity of treated water and the ability of the WTP to meet EPA and DHS requirements. Kennedy/Jenks has developed a detailed understanding of WTP operations through their ex haustive planning efforts as well as by working closely with treatment plant operators and staff over the past four years. They have earned the operators trust and they have effectively become partners with them during implementation of several design and construction projects; working closely with them to develop construction plans that allow them to meet their responsibilities to the public and regulatory agencies. WTP operators have communicated to t he District management and the Board on several occasi ons and expressed their desire to see Kennedy/Jenks continue on with the work at the WTP. This is another qualification that sets Kennedy/Jenks apart for consideration of the design work. Kennedy/Jenks Consultants involvement in planning, testing, design d evelopment, regulatory approval, and construction coordination of improvements to the Districts water treatment plant makes them uniquely qualified, and in the Districts opinion, the best choice, to continue the design of the next phase of the water treatm ent plant modifications; the Hydraulic Improvements. There are no Government-owned drawings or technical literature for the services described herein. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. The followin g are the 5 criteria that we will use for evaluation of qualification: 1. Interested parties must be a licensed engineering, design and science firm and must be experienced in the fields. 2. Information furnished should include detail of appropriate techni cal and professional qualifications. 3. Information furnished must demonstrate the interested party is able to perform engineering and design efforts associated with the hydraulic improvements, and the ability to replicate the plant specific hydraulic mode l at no cost to the government and client in an expedited fashion. 4. Information furnished must demonstrate firms experience with the planning, design, construction and operation of water treatment plants and specifically the Clendenen process. 5. The int erested party must pass a background security check. Information furnished as a minimum should include appropriate technical information and professional qualifications that demonstrates the firms ability to meet the minimum requirements listed above. Resp onses should be limited to a maximum of 10 pages, total. Oral or facsimile responses will not be accepted. Responses should be sent to: Barbara Marshall, Attn: CESKPK-CT, 1325 J Street, Sacramento, CA 95814-2922. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all information received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to  this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If the Government determines, based on the responses to this notice,  that a full and open competition will be conducted, a synopsis will be placed in FedBizOpps announcing the acquisition; otherwise, the Government will proceed with negotiations with one source with no further notice.

7 PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

Afghanistan possesses potentially significant oil and gas resources.  Since the first oil field was discovered in 1959, more than 150 million barrels of oil reserves and more than 4,500 billion cubic feet of gas reserves have been identified in 29 fields in the Afghan portion of the Amu Darya and Afghan-Tajik basins.  Only a very small portion of this resource base has been exploited.  The country has not been well explored for oil and gas potential using the latest techniques, and there is an enormous potential for further discoveries to add to Afghanistanís energy resource base.  That resource base is essential to the economic development of the country.  The development of the countryís hydrocarbon resources is a top priority of the GOA, with President Karzai having expressed support for it.  The GOA believes this is a sector likely to generate direct investment by foreign companies and revenue for the GOA.  Additionally, the development of these resources is essential to alleviating Afghanistanís power crisis.  

USTDA is considering the provision of funding for two projects in the oil and gas sector of Afghanistan: the second stage of the Hydrocarbon Resource Survey (Survey); and the 2-D Seismic Acquisition Project (Seismic Project).  The Survey, which will be conducted by the U.S. Geological Service (USGS), will constitute a comprehensive assessment of Afghanistanís oil and gas resources, based on a detailed study of geochemistry, petroleum geology, and tectonics. The Seismic Project, which would complement the Survey and be conducted by a private sector firm, would acquire and process approximately 600 kilometers of 2-D Vibroseis seismic reflection data in Northern Afghanistan.  USTDA seeks to contract with a U.S. firm (Contractor) to provide Technical Assistance (TA) to assist USTDA in overseeing th

1		SCOPE OF WORK

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (ìUSTDAî) requires services under this non-personal services Contract to support its oversight of projects and activities in the oil and gas sector of Afghanistan.  It is anticipated that the duration of this contract will be thirty (30) months.  The Contractor will provide assistance USTDA in overseeing the Hydrocarbon Resource Survey, which will be conducted by the US Geological Survey (USGS).  It is anticipated that the Hydrocarbon Resource survey will take 22 months to complete, and the Contractorís primary task will be to provide technical reviews of the USGSís bi-monthly reports.  Additionally, the contractor will assist USTDA in overseeing the planned 2-D Seismic Acquisition Project.  In overseeing the 2-D Seismic Acquisition Project it is anticipated that the Contractor will travel to Afghanistan for six (6) weeks.  The Contractor shall provide reports to USTDA, which will: 

1.2		assess an anticipated eleven (11) bi-monthly USGS reports on the progress of the Hydrocarbon Resource Survey (see 7 below); 

1.3		provide assistance to USTDA in overseeing the 2-D Seismic Acquisition Project (see 7 below); and 

1.4		provide supporting analysis and recommendations on the above activities in a final report that analyzes all the relevant issues.

2  		DELIVERY & PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

2.1		KICK-OFF MEETING WITH THE USTDA PROGRAM OFFICE

Upon award, the Contractor shall contact USTDAís Contracting Officerís Technical Representative (COTR) to schedule a meeting to discuss details of the Contract assignment.  Unless otherwise advised by the COTR, this meeting will be held at USTDAís office in Arlington, Virginia. The COTR shall provide the Contractor with names and addresses of the project sponsor(s), other pertinent entities to contact in the United States and overseas, and any other relevant details that may impact upon the design and/or evaluation of the projects.  

2.2		BI-MONTHLY REPORTING ON HYDROCARBON RESOURCE SURVEY
		
		The Contractor shall Prepare and submit to the COTR bi-monthly written assessments of USGSís reports to USTDA on the Hydrocarbon Resource Survey.  These assessments shall contain: an assessment of the compliance of the work performed with the TOR of the Reimbursable Agreement (RA) between USTDA and the USGS; an analysis of the quality of the work in relation to industry standards; an appraisal of the expenditures for the work conducted under the RA; an assessment of the degree to which the work being performed meets the needs of the Government of Afghanistan (GOA) and USTDA; an analysis of the appropriateness of the Survey work plan in relation to the current situation; and advice on other issues as requested by USTDA or as identified by the consultant.  This report shall be written in a form mutually agreed upon by the Contractor and the COTR.

2.3	SELECTION ASSISTANCE

The Contractor shall provide technical assistance in the selection of a firm to perform the 2-D Seismic Acquisition Project.  This assistance will take the form of technical advice delivered to USTDA regarding the preparation of solicitation documents and review of proposals.

2.4	WORK PLAN PREPARATION ASSISTANCE

The Contractor shall provide technical assistance in overseeing the preparation of a work plan for the 2-D Seismic Project.

2.5		PRE-VISIT REPORT 

Prior to departure to the host country, the Contractor shall provide the COTR a pre-visit written report of 3-5 pages containing the proposed schedule or itinerary, preliminary oversight strategy, a list of contacts to be made during the visit and a pre-visit checklist of issues, information and questions to be utilized during the visit.  

2.6		USTDA RESPONSIBILITY

USTDA will advisese projects.

The initial stage of the Survey, which was recently completed by the USGS, involved the preliminary training of Afghan counterparts, review of the data available on site, and the collection of initial samples of oil, gas, and source rock.  The next stage of the Survey would obtain and review all available geochemical, geologic, seismic, tectonic, petroleum exploration and production data from both domestic and international sources.  This data would be analyzed in order to characterize the petroleum geology.  This would involve the definition of petroleum systems and exploration plays using Geographic Information System (GIS) based techniques.  Afghan scientists would be involved in the process in order to build local capacity.  Finally, an assessment of undiscovered oil and gas resources would be conducted and the resulting reports would be disseminated through the USGS and/or the GOA.  When completed the Survey would provide the information needed by the GOA to make policy decisions regarding the development of hydrocarbon resources.  Further, the assessment could be the basis for the designation of ìlease-blocksî and provide the information necessary to attract the interest of international oil and gas exploration companies.  The Survey would also strengthen the GOAs capacity in this field, as the Ministry of Mines and Industry (MMI) would actively participate in the implementation process and the Survey contains a large training component.  

The 2-D Seismic Acquisition Project would acquire additional seismic data to support the analysis of the regionís petroleum geology.  The Soviets ran at least one, and possibly two, seismic lines in the 1970ís.  However, it is unclear if this data is available.  Even if this data were available, there would still be a need for additional seismic work using modern techniques that would meet Western standards.  Therefore, this project will hire a private firm specializing in the acquisition of seismic data to acquire 600 kilometers of 2-D Vibroses seismic reflection data.

<DESC>IF YOU WOULD LIKE A MORE EASILY READABLE COPY OF THIS NOTICE, PLEASE CONTACT FRAN DE ROSA AT 708-786-5921 OR FRAN.DEROSA@MED.VA.GOV SUBJ:  Sources Sought Notice for Patient Gowns (Multi-Purpose, I.V., Telemetry, and X-Ray)  This is a Market Survey and Request for Samples to locate potential sources for the standardization of various patient gowns.   The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) desires to offer its customers, on a national basis, the best possible products and prices and to offer its contractors more opportunities within the system.  The intent of the standardization program is to establish national mandatory sources for medical/surgical items to standardize VAís purchasing of products.  BIDS/OFFERS ARE NOT BEING SOLICITED AT THIS TIME.  Request for Quotations (RFQs) will be issued at a later date.  Potential offerors interested in having their items evaluated for possible inclusion in the standardization process should carefully review the item descriptions listed below.  If a company can provide any of these items, SAMPLES OF ALL ITEMS AVAILABLE THAT MEET OR EXCEED THE CRITERION PROVIDED IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED AT THIS TIME.  Samples are to be provided at no charge and all samples submitted in response to this notice become property of the VA and will not be returned following the evaluation process.  Additional criteria may be added (or existing criteria deleted) during the evaluation process.  If this occurs, all samples received will be evaluated equally against the revised criteria.   NOTE:  ALL SAMPLES SUBMITTED MUST BE MANUFACTURED IN A DESIGNATED COUNTRY, A CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRY, OR A NAFTA COUNTRY (UNITED STATES, CANADA, SINGAPORE, AND MEXICO).  THE USER GROUP WILL ONLY EVALUATE SAMPLES MANUFACTURED IN APPROVED COUNTRIES.  A LISTING OF DESIGNATED COUNTRIES AND CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRIES MAY BE FOUND AT THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE: http://www.acqnet.gov/far/current/html/Subpart_25_1.html#1046559.  All samples submitted must be clearly marked with the name of the potential offeror, the product number, and the manufacturerís name.  Offerors must also include any corresponding detailed product literature with the samples.  Detailed product literature should include, but not limited to, an indication of what materials the products are comprised of (e.g. latex, etc.), country of origin, and a listing of sizes, configurations, etc. available.  Offerors must include a copy of the evaluation criterion contained in this notice with their samples and identify where in the product literature each individual criteria is addressed.  If the product literature does not clearly address any of the criteria information, offerors must provide this information on company letterhead addressing the stated criteria.  In addition, please provide company name, address, contact person and telephone number for questions pertaining to submitted samples.  Also, please provide the company name, address, contact person and telephone number of where any resulting Request for Quotation (RFQ) should be sent.  If detailed literature or sufficient information addressing the evaluation criteria is not received with the samples, the technical evaluation panel will be unable to fully evaluate the samples and the products will be eliminated from further consideration. Offerors are requested to provide procurement history data for the products submitted for evaluation.  Please provide total quantities for each product sold to the VA in the previous 12-month period.  This information will be used to verify the accuracy of the estimated quantities identified in the Request for Quotation (RFQ). VA intends to award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) against FSS contracts rather than issuing formal solicitations for the purpose of standardization.  Those companies who do not have a current FSS contract will be eliminated from the competition prior to any subsequent BPA award.  For additional information in obtaining an FSS contract, please contact James Booth, Federal Supply Schedule Service at 708/786-5183.  Offerors who have a current FSS contract, must ensure that product samples submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice are included on their FSS contract prior to any subsequent BPA award. VA will use the items submitted in response to this request for samples and the results of the evaluations performed on those items to determine which companies are requested to participate in the resulting Request for Quotation. Current FSS contract holders must provide a copy of their current FSS pricelist with their samples.  If you do not have a current FSS contract, please indicate if a proposal has been submitted to begin the procurement process that will result in an FSS contract. The VHA Environmental Management Service User Group, who has expertise and knowledge of the products, will review and technically evaluate any samples submitted.  VA deems the members of the User Group to be experts in their field.  Therefore, they are qualified to make a subjective determination as to which products are acceptable.  **Please send samples (number of samples required follow each product name) and corresponding detailed product literature to: Department of Veterans Affairs, Consolidated Acquisition and Analysis Service (049A5S), ATTN:  Carl Hunter, Building 37, First Avenue - One Block North of Cermak Road (22nd Street), Hines, IL  60141**   SAMPLES AND PRODUCT LITERATURE MUST BE RECEIVED NO LATER THAN  MARCH 5, 2004.

<SUBJECT>A--STANDOFF PRECISION MINE NEUTRALIZATION REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<SOLNBR>W909MY-04-Q-0003
<RESPDATE>030104
<ARCHDATE>04302004
<CONTACT>Peggy Melanson, 703-325-6096
<DESC>The US Army  Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM) Acquisition Center-Washington (CAC-W) on behalf of the CERDEC Night Vision and  Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Science & Technology Division  is soliciting informational white papers fo r development of technologies for precision neutralization, at safe standoff distances, of mines both metal and plastic, on the surface and buried and at speed for a mobile force. This Request for Information (RFI) is issued to assess the current state-of- the-art in standoff precision mine neutralization and to serve as a guide for the types of technologies that may be included in a subsequent BAA.  The data received in response to the RFI will be used for information purposes only and does not, in any way,  mandate or impose requirements.  CERDEC does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for information solicited herein.   The current plan is to issue a separate BAA for Standoff Precision Mine Neutralization in 3QFY04 with  contract award(s) in 4QFY04.  It is highly desirable for the Government to receive unlimited rights to the data provided, however, it is recognized that proprietary data may be included with the information provided.  If this is the case, proprietary data  must be  clearly marked as such  and separated  from the unrestricted information as an addendum.  Proprietary information will be protected.  All responses to this request for information shall be submitted by COB 1 March 2004.  Responses must be submitt ed via electronic mail to Ms. Laura Paskman-Syms, Contract Specialist at laura.paskman-syms@cacw.army.mil.   The email subject line should include the phrase Vendor's Name_W909MY-04-Q-0003_Neutralization Research Response.    Questions pertaining to this a nnouncement may also be submitted via email to Ms. Paskman-Syms.  No telephonic questions or requests will be honored.  Written, replies, responses or evaluations of the white papers may not be provided.  The objective of this request is to survey the stat e-of-the-art for advanced precision mine neutralization technologies to provide new or improved standoff mine neutralization capabilities and means for confirming those neutralizations. Neutralization techniques for consideration include but are not limite d to: explosives, radio frequency technologies, lasers, water jets, directed energy or other methods, with the ultimate goal of demonstrating technologies for precision neutralization with a 0.90 Probability of Kill (Pk) and means for confirming those neut ralizations. Novel concepts for precision delivery of explosive neutralizers at safe standoff distances while at speed are of particular interest. Standoff distances of 50 meters or greater are desired, with a goal of 250 meters. The proposed mine neutrali zation system shall be capable of a minimum rate-of-advance of 25 kph.  Mine neutralization time against individual mines shall be less than 15 minutes, with 2 minutes desired. If neutralization cannot be done instantaneously, the above neutralization time s are for complete destruction of the threat.  Instantaneous or near-real time neutralization techniques are of particular interest.  Techniques that result in minimal damage to road surfaces and can neutralize mines without detonation are also of interest . The proposed technologies shall address individual anti-tank (AT) and anti-personnel (AP) mines and booby traps, whose burial depths can vary from surface laid to 20 cm below the ground surface. Burial depth is measured from the surface of the ground to the top of the target. The landmines will range in size from 4.5 cm to 38cm (which covers AP to AT respectively) in diameter or width. Booby traps can be much larger in dimensions of 38 cms and typically have larger amounts of explosive fills.  Explosive fill is typically RDX, TNT or PETN. Both dumb and smart mines must  be neutralized, though not necessarily by the same technique. The  mines may employ a variet y of fuze types, including pressure, tilt rod,  magnetic influence, seismic/acoustic and other sensors. Both on- and  side attack mines/booby traps must be considered. Sensored off-route and side-attack mines/booby traps are of particular interest. The pro posed technologies are intended for use in support of a highly mobile force; therefore, rate-of-advance (OP-TEMPO) and standoff capability is important. The Army's Future Combat System (FCS) family of vehicles are likely host platforms.   Techniques should  lend themselves to modular and bolt-on applications.  Size, weight and power consumption and other logistical constraints to a highly mobile force are important. Proposed technology  applications should be precision, point or spot neutralizers as opposed to area neutralizers. The proposed research technologies will be required to collect data and eventually demonstrate, at NVESD's mine lane facilities (Ft. AP Hill, VA (Demo Site 71 Alpha)) and other government test facilities (CONUS), high Probabilities of  Kill, an ROA of 25 kph, and neutralization time of less than 15 minutes. The mine neutralization technologies may eventually be inserted into ongoing military operations or the existing spiral development programs within NVESD's Countermine Division.  The se spiral development programs lead to the Ground Standoff Mine Detection System (GSTAMIDS) program(s) managed by the Program Manager for Close Combat Systems (PM-CCS).

<SUBJECT>A -- Development and Commercialization of Bcl-XL Fusion Proteins to Inhibit Neuron Apoptosis in vivo for the Treatment of Spinal Cord Injury or Stroke
<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)  of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) seeks a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) Collaborator to work with NINDS in the development, manufacture and commercialization  of Bcl-XL fusion proteins that inhibit apoptosis in neurons.   NINDS is seeking a development and  commercialization partner for GMP production and in vitro and in vivo testing of   Bcl-XL fusion proteins.

Potential Areas of Application
∑Treatment of spinal cord injury 
∑Treatment of stroke

Main Advantages of Technology/Invention:
∑Bcl-2 family of proteins is potent regulators of apoptosis. We have developed a protein-based Bcl-XL delivery system that increases the cellular levels of Bcl- XL and prevents neuron apoptosis in vitro and in vivo.  For transient apoptotic insults such as spinal cord injury and stroke, the protein may  be delivered to minimize neuron loss. As Bcl- XL prevents apoptosis upstream of caspases, mitochondrial permeabilization and all knows steps of apoptosis this approach should offer the best long term rescue of neurons and offer important therapeutic benefit to spinal cord injury patients.  Stroke also may be a candidate for such a therapy to block acute apoptosis. 

Current State of Development
∑In vitro studies indicate that Bcl- XL fusion proteins inhibit apoptosis in many cell types induced by a variety of insults (PNAS 96: 9563-9567, 1999).
∑In vivo studies indicate that Bcl- XL fusion proteins prevent neuron apoptosis in several trauma models (J. Biol. Chem. 276:46326-32, 2001).    

Further R&D Required:
∑Produce GMP quality Bcl-XL fusion protein
∑Screen  Bcl-XL fusion protein for activity in vitro or in vivo
∑Plan for clinical trials of Bcl-XL fusion proteins

Patent Status:
∑Patent pending ( published as WO 01/12661)
∑Licensing of technology available

Submission Dates:
∑Letter of interest should be received by March 15, 2003.  Proposals will be reviewed in order of receipt

OMBUDSMAN NOTICE - NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesterís concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencyís goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:  Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011*****

<DESC>The 30th Space Wing, Vandenberg AFB, CA, is soliciting offers to purchase a self-contained cabinet style dust collector rated to handle 9500AACFM at 8 inch W.G. external static pressure. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation reference number is FA4610-04-Q-0002 and the solicitation is issued as a request for quotation.. This solicitation incorporates Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-18. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 421830 and the size standard is 500 employees. This acquisition is a 100% small business set-aside. Line item 0001 - American Air Filter Arrestall Model AF-75; or equal - Qty 1 each, to include the following specifications: Dust-ladened air enters below the cartridge area, changes direction 90 degrees and flows through cartridge filter pockets. This change in direction causes separation and deposition of larger, heavier particles directly into the dust storage device, reducing the dust load to the filter cartridge. Finer particles are collected on the filter cartridge. Air is channeled by pocket separators directly upward in a laminar flow pattern, gathered by the fan inlet cone, and exhausted by the BI fan wheel through the acoustically lined fan scroll top outlet. Collected dust is periodically discharged from the filter cartridge surface by the high-energy automatic shaker and falls into the dust disposal area below. Overall construction shall be of galvanneal steel for maximum corrosion resistance. The exterior shall be finish coated with a vinyl lacquer. Cartridge and fan access shall be through full height doors with quick opening, flush latches for speed and security. The unit shall also include a 1/4 inch plate motor mounting bracket assembly with lifting lug openings. Standard construction includes external combination weather cover/silencer with drilled outlet for return air connection. Fan shall be backward inclined for non-overloading operation. Fan wheel shall be constructed of aluminum and shall be fitted with a scroll for maximum efficiency and quiet operation. It shall be belt driven by a 30 HP (230/460/60/3) 1725 rppm TEFC motor. Fan motor starters shall be included as part of quotation. Both fan and motor shall be dynamically balanced for smooth vibration free operation. The outlet area shall be lined with a strong smooth fiberglass laminated mat for sound attenuation. This liner shall be designed for temperatures of up to 250 degrees F, and shall meet the fire resistance requirements of NFPA 90A and 90B. Filter Cartridge shall consist of individual pockets sewn from on piece of 8.2-ounce cotton sateen fabric designed to deliver in excess of 99% efficiency by weight on fine industrial dusts. Filter cartridge shall have rigid corrugated separators to prevent pocket collapse and to channel cleaned air in a laminar flow profile into fan inlet cone. Adjacent pockets shall be positioned by steel bars at the top and flat shaker fingers at the bottom to prevent mutual blank off and to maintain the dust cake collection area. A total of 6 filter cartridges shall supply 792 sq. ft. of filter area. Cartridge shall be fitted over a galvanized steel locking frame and all separators securely positioned by a galvanized steel retainer resulting in a tight pocket assembly to minimize pressure drop and maximize dust release. Each cartridge assembly shall be locked in place by two lever actuated over-center cam assemblies, which force the steel header frame securely against a 3/4 inch x1.5 inch neoprene gasket surface. Automatic Filter Cleaning shall be delivered by two (2) horizontal contact systems that shall distribute shaking force throughout each individual filter pocket. Pockets shall be held tightly by flat shaker fingers which impart an acceleration equal to a minimum of 7 Gs from motorized 3/4 HP eccentric driven shaker assemblies.

6.  Terms/Conditions/Attachments added, deleted, or modified:

ADD: CREW LIST.  Offerors must provide an accurate and current crew list within 24 hours of contract award and, additionally, no later than 96 hours prior to delivery of the vessel at the designated load or delivery port (or first designated load port in the case of multiple load ports), time permitting.  Further, at any time during the contract period a list of any reliefs scheduled to board the vessel is required 96 hours prior to the personnel change.  The crew list shall include full name (including middle name or the letters ìNMNî if no middle name), date of birth, place of birth (city and country), passport number and country of issue, and nationality of all crewmembers and other personnel onboard the vessel. The list shall be submitted in an electronic format (Microsoft Excel only).  Scanned lists are unacceptable.  Any delay resulting from Ownerís failure to provide the list within the prescribed time frames shall result in a corresponding increase in the time afforded to Charterer to accept delivery of the Vessel.

ADD:  IN-TRANSIT VISIBILITY.
 
(1) The Military Sealift Command has implemented a fully automated satellite tracking system (ASTARS) for the purpose of providing In-Transit Visibility (ITV) of its vessels.  To support this system MSC utilizes position data provided by a ship's INMARSAT-C terminal (the terminal must have a GPS input). This is a critical requirement and is therefore mandatory. 

(2) In order to initiate reporting and start receiving the required data from a ship, MSC needs to know the make and model of the INMARSAT-C terminal, its registered identification number, and the specific satellite (POR, AORE, AORW, or IOR) it is currently logged on to.  Once this information is received, MSC technicians will remotely communicate with the terminal to activate reporting.  When no longer required, MSC technicians will stop the terminal from reporting.  MSC technicians may require some assistance from ship's personnel should problems occur.  The ship's terminal will accrue a nominal cost associated with the sending of small data packets.

ADD: FORCE PROTECTION.  

(1) Owner agrees that U. S. Armed Forces personnel may board the Vessel at any time at any location for U. S. national security purposes, gives consent for such boarding, and agrees to cooperate fully with such U.S. Armed Forces personnel in the boarding party.  Owner also agrees to permit U. S. Armed Forces personnel to search without limitation any and all vessel spaces for U.S. national security purposes.

(2) Owner agrees to render all necessary assistance to U. S. Armed Forces personnel with respect to the identification and screening of crew members or such others as may be aboard the Vessel.  Owner consents to the immediate removal of crewmembers or such others as may be aboard the Vessel deemed unsuitable for any reason by the Contracting Officer or U.S. Armed Forces personnel.  Owner agrees to replace any such crewmembers promptly and that such replacements will fully comply with all crew screening requirements.  Charterer agrees to bear proven and reasonable costs incurred by Owner associated with replacement, if necessary.

(3) Charterer reserves the right, at Chartererís sole option, to embark U.S. Armed Forces personnel and their weapons at any time during the period of the Charter to protect U. S. Armed Forces personnel, cargo or equipment on board the Vessel.  These force protection personnel will provide security in accordance with rules of engagement established by competent U. S. military authorities and will operate under the command of such authorities.  Charterer agrees to reimburse Owner for cost of such personnel at the rate set forth in the Charter for Supercargo.

(4) Owner agrees to comply fully with the current ship threat condition measures required by relevant Navy and MSC Force Protection instructions and messages for the threat condition of the area.  See paragraph IV(ae) for additional requirements, although the requirements of COMSC instruction 5530.3 shall apply only to time charters of six months or longer.   

ADD: SECURITY THREAT.  In the event of a security threat or incident involving the ship, crew or cargo during the voyage, the ship's master should report any incident immediately to the MSC Area Command in whose area the ship is currently located.  The MSCHQ Command Center should be contacted if the Area Command cannot be reached.  Contact numbers will be provided upon award.

ADD:  SALVAGE.

(1) When engaged in the carriage of government cargo and if requested by Charterer, Owner agrees to accept Navy salvage services.  Such services may be provided using Navy personnel and resources or Navy contracted resources.

(2) In providing such services, the Navy, through Charterer, agrees to waive all claims for ìpureî or ìbonusî salvage.  Instead, in those cases in which the salvage services are provided by Navy personnel and resources, the salvage claim shall be limited to a schedule of current per diem rates and allowable expenses as established by the Navyís Supervisor of Salvage.  In no event shall such amount exceed a maximum claim of $25,000 per day.



ADD: IMMUNIZATIONS. (U.S.-flag only)

(1)  U.S. flag time chartered vessel services are considered essential contractor services to the Department of Defense in support of military and associated support missions.  As a result, Masters, officers, crewmembers, and other individuals who are embarked on such vessels for Ownerís purposes, including but not limited to subcontractors, are considered contractor personnel performing mission essential services under DODI 3020.37, November 6, 1990, (Change 1, January 26, 1996), and are subject to the following:

    a.  Masters, officers, crewmembers and other individuals, as described above, who are embarked on any vessel subject to this charter must be medically pre-screened and immunized in accordance with Commander, Military Sealift Command (COMSC) policy, and any changes thereto, in effect or made during the period of this charter, including any options or extensions.  Owner shall ensure that all Masters, Officers, crewmembers, and other individuals embarked on any vessel subject to this charter comply with all such immunization programs.  Notification of immunization requirements pursuant to this section shall be provided to Owner by the Contracting Officer.

    b.  When immunizations are required pursuant to this clause, Owner must provide notification, as directed by the Contracting Officer, of the immunization status of all embarked personnel within 24 hours of fixture or award.  Further, at any time during the contract period, the immunization status of any relief personnel scheduled to board the vessel is required no later than 96 hours prior to the personnel change, unless authorized otherwise by the Contracting Officer.

    c.  Any Master, officer, crewmember or other individual who refuses to comply with the immunization requirements, or who is ineligible for a particular required immunization as provided herein, shall be removed by Owner from the vessel as soon as possible, but not later than the next port call unless authorized by the Contracting Officer, and replaced with personnel who either have the required immunization or are eligible and will comply with the policy.  Any removal and replacement of personnel pursuant to this clause shall be solely at Ownerís expense, including, but not limited to, travel, per diem, wages and associated administrative expenses.

    d.  Crew shortages resulting from the application of this section may subject the vessel to being placed off-hire.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Request for Proposal number is N62645-04-R-0003.  Provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-16 are incorporated.  NAICS 423450.  Naval Medical Logistics Command has the following requirement for a ceiling mounted medical examination light.  The resulting contract will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract with a 3-year ordering period containing a minimum for 22 units and a maximum of 500.  The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate with Offerors on an open competition basis to procure ceiling mounted medical examination lights for Navy ships of the line.  Offerors are required to forward proposal and technical documentation by  21 Jan 04. 

Technical evaluations will be conducted in three stages. Stage 1 is compliance with minimum salient essential characteristics. Stage 2 will be the evaluation of Past Performance information and a confirmation of a complete pricing proposal. Stage 3 will be the shipboard installation and demonstration of the product and the evaluation of the pricing proposal. The Technical Proposal shall address all the minimum salient characteristics.  The Government will not assume that the offeror possesses any capability unless it is specified in the proposal. Proposals should include Past Performance Information from three sources to include: 1.) Agency name; 2.) Agency point of contact and telephone number; 3.) Contract number; 4.) Type and number of units provided; and 5.) Delivery and Performance Information (Contract delivery schedules and actual delivery schedules.) 6.) Quality (Total number of units submitted for inspection and total number rejected.)  Proposals should include Pricing on the following items: 1.) Ceiling mounted medical examination light and 2.) Complete installation to make unit fully operational.  Information on the existing mount can be requested via email to Wendy Graybill at wlgraybill@nmlc.med.navy.mil.  Pricing proposals shall include copies of published commercial price lists, or other documentation setting forth the prices charged to the general public for same or similar items. The Government will make award to the responsible offeror submitting the proposal that is determined most advantageous to the Government, cost and other factors considered.  The evaluation of proposals will be based on an evaluation of the technical and price proposals submitted by each offeror and the shipboard installation and demonstration.  The technical evaluation factors are significantly more important than cost.  In the event that two or more technical proposals are determined not to have any substantial technical differences, the award may be made to the lower price proposal.  It should be noted that award may be made to other than the low offeror.  Award may also be made on the basis of initial offers without discussions.  Therefore, offerors are cautioned that each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms.  Failure to submit any information requested would result in a determination that the technical or pricing proposal is incomplete and the offeror may not be considered further for award. Technical evaluation will be done in two stages.  Each offer must document compliances in Stage 1 before proceeding to Stage 2. Offerors providing acceptable results from Stage 2 will proceed to Stage 3. 
    
Stage 1: The technical documentation will be compared to the essential minimum salient characteristics and the evaluation factors listed below. Salient characteristics will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis.  The requirement is for a ceiling mounted medical examination light that has the following essential minimum salient characteristics: 1.) Shall be a ceiling mounted medical examination light; 2.) Shall have a minimum 150 degrees of rotation about the extension arm; 3.) Shall have a minimum of 60 degrees of rotation about the yoke; 4.) Shall have a minimum of 90 degrees of rotation about the vertical support of the lighthead; 5.) The light color shall be within 15% of 4500 degrees Kelvin; 6.) Shall have a minimum illuminance of 50,000 Lux; 7.) The focal range shall start at a minimum of 24 inches and not extend past 50 inches from the lighthead; 8.) The lighthead shall not cause a temperature rise of more than 4oC; 9.) The lighthead shall have a minimum rating of 500 hours on the light source; 10.) Shipís power will be supplied to the product at 120 VAC. In addition to the above mentioned essential characteristics, the proposal shall state that the ceiling mounted medical examination light shall be capable of passing the following tests: 1.) High Temperature (Operational) - The test items will be placed in the chamber at 120oF, and the operational component is accomplished by cycling the lights on and off once per hour for 8 hours; 2.) High Temperature (Storage) - The test items will be placed in the chamber at 120oF for 24 hours.  The systems will be removed from the chamber and operated to determine if they function; 3.) Low Temperature (Operational) - The test items will be placed in the chamber at 40oF, and the operational component is accomplished by cycling the lights on and off once per hour for 8 hours; 4.) Low Temperature (Storage) -The test items will be placed in the chamber at -60oF for 24 hours. The systems will be removed from the chamber and operated to determine if they function; 5.) Humidity - Temperature will be set to 120oF and humidity was set to 90%.  The test items will be placed in the chamber for 8 hours. The systems will be removed from the chamber and operated to determine if they function; and 6.) Vibration - The test items will be placed on a single axis vibration table.  The test items will be exposed to the MIL-STD 810E, Method 514.4 vibration signature (copies available) for 30 minutes.  This vibration profile is a composite of what the military believes the equipment will be subjected to.  They will be removed from the table and operated to determine if they function.

Stage 2 will consist of a comparative evaluation of past performance information encompassing subfactors 1) Similar Work, 2) Delivery and 3) Quality and a confirmation of a complete pricing proposal. 

Stage 3: The offerors who provide acceptable proposals based on criteria above will be requested to demonstrate their products on 29 Jan 04 at the Naval Sea Systems Command in Norfolk, VA. at no expense to the Government.  Demonstration shall consist of the following parameters: 1.) Offerors will be limited to three personnel to represent their company; 2.) The Offerors will be given one hour to demonstrate their products. The demonstration will be used to evaluate the time and tools needed to install and make the light operational within a shipboard environment and meet minimum requirements in Stage 1 (items 1-10). Offerors will be further evaluated in the area of pricing. Pricing proposals will be evaluated based on the following factors, Completeness, Reasonableness and Realism. 

A determination of award will then be made to the offeror who has demonstrated a product that represents the best value to the Government. After award the contractor will provide a sample of their medical examination light for acceptance testing. The Government will test the sample to determine compliance with all the characteristics listed in Stage 1 of this solicitation for survival within the shipboard environment.  Samples shall be 1.) Submitted at no expense to the Government; and 2.) Returned at the Contractors request and expense, which may be damaged during testing. Failure to meet the acceptance testing will result in a Termination of the contract and subsequent award to the next ranked vendor.
