<DESC><strong><br />The esimated posting date for the full solicitation is 04/12/13 - 04/15/13.<br /><br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Information - <br /><br /></span>The RRB is seeking a single contractor who can provide consultative medical exam services and /or ancillary tests used as supportive evidence in making a determination of disability under federal guidelines, for either a current or former railroad employee or his&rsquo; or hers&rsquo; widow(er) or child.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Overview - <br /><br /></span>The disability program, administered by the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB), is mandated by the Railroad Retirement Act (RR Act). When the disability decision is rendered by the RRB that decision is based on the regulations as cited in the current edition of 20 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Employees' Benefits, Part 220. <br /><br />The nationwide program consists of the following:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <br /></span>
<p><br />&bull; initial determinations of disability, which may result in monthly annuity payments;</p>
<p>&bull; "disability freeze" determinations, which may result in, among other things, early Medicare coverage;</p>
<p>&bull; continuing disability review (CDR) activity, which determines continuing entitlement to disability benefits; and</p>
<p>&bull; an appeals process, which affords any applicant who disagrees with a disability determination rendered by the RRB an opportunity for administrative review.</p>
<p>Consultative examinations and/or ancillary tests are used as supportive evidence in making a determination of disability under Federal guidelines for either a current or former railroad employee or his/her widow(er) or child.<br /><br />The primary emphasis in disability claims processing is not on treatment, but rather on identifying the functional limitations that may interfere with the claimant's ability to work. Therefore, the consultative examination and report must be in sufficient detail to permit the claims examiner and/or evaluating physician - who do not see or examine the applicant - to determine the severity and duration of the impairment. This determination is made within set guidelines that require that objective medical findings be documented in a detailed manner and with the use of specific testing procedures. These manners and procedures are governed by regulations. Alternative testing methods and procedures shall not be used in the disability determination. The types of examinations and tests the RRB will order depend upon the evidence needed for the disability determination. The RRB will order only the specific examinations or ancillary tests needed. If an ancillary test such as an X-ray, blood study, or EKG will furnish the additional evidence needed for the disability determination, a more comprehensive medical examination&nbsp;will not be&nbsp;ordered.</p>
<p>The solicitation will outline a program whereby ordered consultative examinations will be furnished by a contractor who shall establish and maintain systems and procedures necessary to provide consistent quality, timely response and adequate control. Cost control, accuracy and utilization of electronic data interchange (EDI), including a paperless payment system, are the desireables and benefits of such a contract.</p>

However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. The solicitation, attachments, and any subsequent amendments will be available at <a href="https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP"><span>https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP</span></a><span> on the issue date of 4/15/13. Drawings/specifications will be available through the DIBBS solicitation link in the synopsis on the solicitation issue date. Contractors will be required to have access to classified data - facility clearance of CONFIDENTIAL required and level of safeguarding of CONFIDENTIAL required. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer. This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304</span>( c )(1). Approved sources are: Raytheon (05716), Cobham Elec Sys (96341). While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation. The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307. Various Increments Solicited: FROM: 6 TO: 25</p>

<DESC>Pre-solicitation Notice for Solicitation No. 13-102-SOL-00001.
<p>This pre-solicitation synopsis notifies potential offerors about a Two Phase Design-Build (DB) opportunity for the Kayenta Quarters Design-Build Construction project administered by Indian Health Service. This notice does NOT constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, or an invitation for bid.</p>
<p>The Indian Health Service, Division of Engineering Services-- Seattle (IHS-DES-SEA) announces the opportunity for qualified contractors with Design-Build project delivery experience to provide design and to construct up to 129 new staff quarters in Kayenta, Arizona, for housing medical and operational staff of the new Kayenta Health Center currently under construction. Kayenta is a community of approximately 5,000 people in the northeastern corner of Arizona on the Navajo Nation. Kayenta is approximately 300 miles north of Phoenix, Arizona, and 300 miles northwest of Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p>
<p>Housing will be co-located with the hospital on a single, dedicated plot of land with a common approach and shared circulating roadway. Housing units will be composed of a mix of occupancies and configurations to best utilize the site and to support recruitment and retention of non-local medical staff. Emphasis will be placed on developing the housing to incorporate specific sustainability goals, operational maintainability, and community features; and how the site layout, massing, and organization enhances the public and staff functions of the hospital environment; specifically the unique, remote location and cultural setting of this project.</p>
<p>Project phasing during the contract is anticipated. The initial phase will complete all design, with options for construction of site utilities, roads, paths, sidewalks, lighting, support structures, and other common features along with some number of initial housing units.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that work will commence in the summer of 2013 with a performance period of three years.</p>
<p>IHS intends to award a firm-fixed price competitive acquisition using the best-value trade-off process.

<p>Project Magnitude: The total design-build project is expected to fall within a price range between $30,000,000 and $40,000,000.&emsp;</p>
<p>Competition is restricted as 100% set-aside for small business. The small business size standard associated with NAICS 236115 is $33.5 million, which means that a company, including its affiliates, would be considered a "small business" if their average annual gross receipts do not exceed $33.5 million for the past three years. Any qualified responsible small business firm including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses.</p>
<p>Phase One Solicitation - Request for Qualifications (RFQ) will identify those firms which are most highly qualified as evaluated on experience, past performance, qualifications, organization and technical approach. Firms that wish to be considered for Phase One shall provide submittals in accordance with instructions in the Phase One solicitation which will be posted on or about January 11, 2013. It is anticipated that a maximum of three (3) firms will be selected for consideration for Phase Two - Request for Proposals (RFP). <br /><br />The Phase Two - RFP submission will be the basis of making the final selection. Those firms selected to participate in Phase Two will be required to prepare fully developed preliminary design, technical and price proposals. Oral presentations are anticipated to supplement the submitted, written proposals. The Government may allow a stipend for preparation of Phase Two proposals.</p>
<p>Evaluation factors will be stated within the solicitation.</p>

<DESC>NASA/KSC has a requirement for 1) Interpoint Dual output DC/DC Converter  Part #: MOR2815DW  Qty: (20), 2) Interpoint Single output DC/DC Converters  Part #: MOR2812SW Qty: (6), 3) Interpoint EMI Filter  Part #: FMCE1528W  Qty: (9).   NASA/KSC intends to purchase the items from Crane Electronics, Inc.  Crane is the only company able to provide the converters and filters due to them being the makers and only distributors of the items.  This was determined after market research provided no other alternatives.  NASA/KSC personnel have been designing with both the Interpoint DC/DC Converters and the Interpoint EMI Filters for the Plant Habitat prototype unit. Engineering work such as electrical schematics and circuit board drawings have been completed based on the Interpoint products to ensure interoperability.	Switching to another product would require the rework of all the drawings and schematics resulting in additional costs and schedule delays.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 11, 2013.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ, intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with Advanced Concepts and Technologies International (ACT I), 1105 Wooded Acres, Suite 500, Waco, TX 76710, a Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract for Cost, Affordability and Technical Service Support for the Joint Strike Fighter Program Office (JSFPO) Arlington, VA. The Government intends to procure the above services under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, to ensure there will not be a break in the required services while a competitive Seaport-e Task Order is being put in place. The procurement will consist of a six-month base period and two three-month options.
<p>The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) F-35 program is a joint DoD ACAT 1D major acquisition program that includes the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U. S. Marine Corps. JSF F-35 also includes eight foreign partner countries formally identified as Cooperative Partner Participants (CPP) along with three other countries called Security Cooperative Participants (SCP). The F-35 JPO requires cost, affordability and technical support services to support its critical mission of developing the next generation strike fighter aircraft. The program cost, affordability, and technical support disciplines consist of Program Management, Cost Estimating, Earned Value Management, Scheduling and System Integration Support. These services support the development of cost models and provide analysis for cost, schedule and Autonomic Logistics and Global Sustainment (ALGS). The work to be performed under this contract will ensure that the JSF F-35's Cost and Earned Value Management (EVM) Integrated Product Team (IPT) has the technical expertise to procure an affordable next generation strike aircraft weapon system.<br /><br />The services of this procurement will support JSF F-35 locations in Arlington, VA and Wright Patterson Air Force Base, OH. <br /><br />ACT I is currently supplying the support services for this requirement. It is in the Government's best interest to issue a new contract to ACT I for a continuation of services while the competitive Seaport-e Task Order is being put in place. This will ensure there will not be a break in the services required; any interruption to these services would cause the JSF F-35 program to lose critical program data and information.</p>
<p>This sole source action is a temporary bridge for the continuation of services until the Seaport-e Task Order is in place. A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based upon the response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be received within fifteen (15) days of publication of this notice. Any responses should reverence N68335-13-R-0018.

The Panel shall recommend a short-list of qualified firms to the selecting official for review and approval. <br />&emsp;<br />The short-listed Lead Designers, and their associated A/E firms, will be notified in writing and requested to submit information for evaluation in Stage 2. In Stage 2, the short-listed offerors will assemble their technical teams and submit detailed information as to their proposed team, management plan, and past performance on construction documents. Sufficient time will be provided for the Lead Designer(s), and their associated A/E firms, to establish their team.</p>
<p>Following notification, the Stage 2 offerors and OBO will be required to travel to Beirut, Lebanon for a general orientation and overview of the site. A fixed stipend, in an amount yet to be determined, but intended to defray the cost of travel will be provided to offerors in Stage 2. More information will be provided to the Stage 2 short-listed offerors.</p>
<p>In Stage 3, the final short-list of offerors will make presentations to the Architectural-Engineering Council (AEC). The AEC will hold discussions with each of the short-listed firms. The AEC will not re-score the remaining offerors, but will make its own determination of the most highly qualified team, consistent with the announced evaluation criteria and will recommend that offeror for award to the OBO Director.</p>
<p>This is neither a request for proposal nor a design competition. Since a contract may result in an award over $500,000, large businesses will be required to submit a small business subcontracting plan prior to contract award. The small business size standard North American Industry Classification System code is 541310, $7.0 million average.</p>
<p>This selection shall be in accordance with the Brooks Act, P.L. 92-582 (40 U.S.C. 1101-1104) and FAR Part 36. After the successful offeror has been selected, the resultant contract award will be dependent on the conclusion of successful negotiations concerning level of effort and price.</p>
<p>In order to be eligible for award of this contract, the successful offeror(s) must possess, or be eligible to obtain, a Defense Security Service (DSS) Secret Facility Clearance (FCL), with Secret safeguarding capability, issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, DOD 5220.22-M. Personnel requiring access to classified information or Controlled Access Areas (CAAs) at DoS locations must possess a Secret personnel security clearance issued by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO). Additionally, the successful offeror selected for contract award must possess, or immediately obtain an Information System (IS) or standalone computer, approved by DSS, for processing classified information. Performance on this contract will require access to the Department's ProjNet-C, for receipt and transmission of all classified information, and a DSS-approved classified IS for processing classified information. Offerors already possessing the necessary FCL should submit their appropriate Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code with their Stage 2 submissions. <br />&emsp;<br />If an uncleared offeror from the Stage 2 short-list is recommended to the Director for selection, the Department of State will sponsor the uncleared firm for an FCL. Firms which form joint ventures must also comply with the above FCL requirements. Each entity comprising the joint venture must be issued an FCL, as well as the joint venture. Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the clearance.</p>
<p>Until the selected firm has been issued at least an Interim Secret FCL, and received DSS approval to safeguard classified documents, they will not receive the classified portions of the RFP requirements package. A period of 90 calendar days, from the date of sponsorship, will be allowed for an uncleared contractor to obtain a Secret FCL. If the firm has not obtained the FCL after 90 days, the Government may terminate negotiations with the offeror and may move to select another short-listed firm for award.</p>
<p>Foreign firms are not eligible for FCLs. Only U.S. firms organized and operating in the U.S. or Puerto Rico, or a U.S. possession or trusted territory, are eligible for facility clearances. U.S. firms which are determined to be under Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI) are not eligible for an FCL unless actions (as directed and approved by DSS) can be taken to effectively negate or reduce associated FOCI risks to an acceptable level. This process often takes more than the 90 calendar days allotted for clearance. Information on the clearance process can be found on the DSS website, at http://www.dss.mil, under Industrial Security.</p>
<p>Certain design team subcontractors/consultants may also require FCLs and personnel security clearances. The Department of State may sponsor one uncleared design subcontractor/consultant, at the request of an uncleared short-listed firm. Any other uncleared design team subcontractors/consultants must be sponsored by the short-listed firm, only after that firm receives its own FCL.</p>
<p>A copy of the Prohibited Countries List, from which offerors may not choose design team members, can be obtained from the Contracting Officer listed in the last paragraph of this announcement. Additionally, a citizen of Lebanon, or even a dual U.S./Lebanese citizen, may not be a Lead or Principal for the design.</p>
<p>Firms being considered for award under this acquisition are limited to "United States Person" offerors, as defined in the Act. The offeror(s) must complete and submit one copy as part of its qualification package the pamphlet (bound separately), Certifications Relevant to Public Law 99-399, Statement of Qualifications for Purpose of Section 402 of The Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986. (The pamphlet is attached to this announcement and may also be obtained from the Contracting Officer listed at the end of this notice.) <br />&emsp;<br />A firm being considered for award must meet the definition of a "United States person" of P.L. 99-399, Section 402 thereof, as follows: (1) be legally organized in the United States more than five years prior to the issuance of a request for proposal; (2) have its principal place of business in the United States; (3) have performed within the U.S. administrative, technical or professional services similar in complexity, type of construction, and value of the project being solicited; (4) employ U.S. citizens in a least 80 percent of principal management positions in the U.S.; and (5) have existing technical and financial resources in the U.S. to perform the contract. Firms not meeting the "United Sates persons" requirement will not be considered.</p>
<p>Offerors that meet the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit the required Stage 1 documents. Firms shall submit four hard copies and one digital, PDF version on CD. The submission shall incorporate tabs to clearly identify the different solicitation requirements. Offerors may find a copy of the SF-330 at the following website: http://contacts.gsa.gov/webforms.nsf/0/21DBF5BF7E860FC185256E13005C6AA6/$file/SF%20330.pdf.</p>
<p>Offerors are advised that inaccurate or incomplete submissions, or those not meeting the submission requirements, may result in immediate disqualification.</p>
<p>All submissions listed in Stage 1 (including one hard copy, separately bound, of the statement of qualifications of P.L. 99-399), must be received by 10:00 a.m., Eastern Daylight Time, on <br />May 1, 2013. Requests for clarification, technical and contractual, must be received, in writing, by Brian Mulcahy, not later than 2:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time, on April 4, 2013.

<DESC><strong>1. GENERAL INFORMATION:<br /></strong>For planning and information purposes, the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) is seeking potential sources for Contractor Logistic Support (CLS) of the Air Force AN/TMS-2 Portable Doppler Radar. AN/TMS-2s sustainment must be operationally accepted by the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA). A contractor shall provide supplies and services required to plan, manage, execute engineering, integration, logistics, and operational support tasks; including all software/hardware modifications/upgrades and merchandise purchase options for the current fielded systems.
<p><br /><strong>2. BACKGROUND: <br /></strong>AN/TMS-2 is a Portable Doppler Radar system that detects, collects, makes data available locally, and delivers weather data information to AFWA, who in turn provides PDR data and products to its customers. In particular, Operational Weather Squadrons use the PDR data and products as part of a comprehensive and ongoing environmental analysis and mission impact assessment to produce weather warnings, watches, advisories, and other mission-essential weather products that are delivered to support air and ground operators. The AN/TMS-2 system enables interoperability to provide consistent and relevant radar analysis information to joint decision makers. AN/TMS-2 will generate radar products using volume scan technology that greatly reduces man-intensive analysis and automates radar control. The AN/TMS-2 system operates at the UNCLASSIFIED security/classification level on DoD-provided common-user communications networks. The United States Air Force has approximately 20 systems at various locations worldwide which can be re-located to other locations within days.</p>
<p>The sustainment effort described herein must be performed such that a common hardware and software configuration baseline is maintained. A common AN/TMS-2 hardware and software configuration baseline is critical to ensure form, fit, and function commonality to concurrently support the AN/TMS-2 mission and its interface with the Weather Product Management and Distribution System (WPMDS), at AFWA, as well as maintain commonality in operations, maintenance, and logistics among all AN/TMS-2 sites.</p>
<p><br /><strong>3. REQUESTED CAPABILITY:<br /></strong>The procurement contract is ending and sustainment will begin at the end of that contract. The radar must be maintained and spares supplied.

<DESC>This is not a notice of solicitation issuance. This is an RFI for planning purposes only.
<p>Introduction and Purpose: <br />The Department of the Air Force (the "Air Force"), through the Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC), requests an expression of interest from prospective tenants (primary occupants, developers, contractors, teams, consortiums, joint ventures) capable of leasing a portion of an approximately 195,820 square foot facility at Rome Laboratory, Rome, New York currently used by the Air Force as an administrative building. The Air Force seeks to gather information to fully analyze this leasing opportunity, as well as to gather broad data from and understanding of the questions and concerns of potential participants. The Air Force will consider a variety of approaches to this leasing opportunity and respondents are encouraged to submit alternative business models to improve the return to the Air Force. Please submit any questions or additional information you would like included in a potential future solicitation, should this leasing opportunity proceed.</p>
<p>The Air Force will use information received in response to this RFI in determining whether to issue a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for the leasing opportunity and, if so, to develop the content for the RFQ. If the Air Force proceeds with an RFQ, it will evaluate the responses and may select a "highest ranked offeror" with whom to negotiate the final terms of the lease transaction and execute the appropriate lease documents.</p>
<p>Background Information:</p>
<p>The Air Force is authorized by statute to lease real property that is not currently needed for public use but is not considered "excess" property available for sale or other permanent disposal. The Air Force is required to obtain not less than fair market value for the lease, to be paid in cash or in-kind consideration. AFCEC is the agency responsible for executing and managing such leases on behalf of the Air Force. <br />The Air Force is considering the merits of leasing a portion of Building 106 (the "Property") at Rome Laboratory. Building 106 is a two story building with approximately 195,820 square feet that fronts Hangar Road and Moody Street. The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate currently occupies approximately 50% of the building and has no plans to fully vacate the facility unless new space could be built as part of payment coming from the lessee. With that said, different space configurations would be considered. Please see the attachments for maps, floor plans, pictures and general information on the Property.</p>
<p>Expression of Interest Desired:</p>
<p>The Air Force expects all expressions of interest to be commercially funded and financially viable ventures taking into account all associated commercial risk. The Air Force is not proposing to lease back any part of the facility.</p>
<p>Please address as many of the following questions as possible in your response:<br />1. Would you be interested in leasing part of the facility or would you need to lease the entire facility to make the project economically viable?<br />2. Would you need an entire floor or is there a scenario in which you would accept leasing a portion of a floor?<br />3. Do you envision doing major renovations/redevelopment of the building such as tearing down walls and reconfiguring the leased space?<br />4. Would you occupy the space or sublease to other companies?<br />5. What is your intended use for the facility and do you envision future tenants having any connection with the mission of Rome Laboratory?<br />6. Do you foresee any issues associated with being located on Air Force land and complying with Anti-Terrorism and Force Protection (ATFP) requirements? Would the nature of your proposed use require a significant level of access by persons who are not your employees or contractors and would therefore be more difficult to clear through security (e.g., customers, clients)? <br />7. How long a lease term would you need to make the project worthwhile?<br />8. How long of an absorption period do you project to bring the facility close to 100% occupancy?<br />9. Please describe a possible redevelopment strategy of the Property, including possible design, site plan, build-out schedule, and marketability.<br />10. Please identify the potential issues or questions involving environmental and land development permitting/approvals, access to utilities, transportation access, infrastructure, and applicable State and local building, land use and development laws, regulations, policies, or ordinances.<br />11. What additional questions or concerns would you need answered/mitigated before responding to an RFQ?</p>
<p>Attachments:<br />Attachment A: Rome Laboratory Building 106 Description<br />Attachment B: Rome Laboratory Building 106 Maps and Photos<br />Attachment C: Rome Laboratory Building 106 Floor Plans <br />&emsp;<br />Handling and Processing:<br />All responses received will be considered. The Air Force may terminate or continue to pursue this effort. The Air Force may use consultants to assist with its review of responses. All responses received become the property of the Air Force and may be held for an extended period of time or destroyed. In no case will any responses be returned to the originator. All information desired or required to be handled as proprietary or as confidential business information must be clearly, conspicuously, and appropriately marked. Information clearly, conspicuously, and appropriately marked as proprietary or confidential will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Air Force procedures. The Air Force shall not be liable for sharing, divulging, disseminating, or otherwise publicizing proprietary or confidential information which is not clearly, conspicuously and appropriately marked as such.</p>
<p>This RFI is for data gathering and planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that any further action will be taken on this RFI or the information received pursuant to it. The Air Force will not be responsible for direct or indirect costs, expenses, or charges that arise as a result of the submission of information in response to this RFI.</p>
<p>General Due Date:<br />Responses to this RFI are preferred in hard copy via regular USPS mail with an electronic copy by email to be received no later than 5:00 P.M., Central Standard Time, on April 19, 2013 to the following:</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - New Jersey, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 on <br> behalf of the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is conducting a market <br> survey to identify potential sources for immediate procurement or rapid development <br> of a kit to lighten the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Multi-Role Anti <br> -Armor Anti- Personnel Weapon System (MAAWS) M3 Carl Gustaf Rifle. The current <br> MAAWS program is the Non-Developmental Item (NDI) acquisition of the Saab Dynamics <br> Carl Gustaf 84mm recoilless rifle system. Note that the U.S. Government does not <br> own data rights to the system which consists of the M3 Carl Gustaf System and <br> family of munitions, rather it is owned by Saab Dynamics, Karlskoga, Sweden.   <br>  <br> USSOCOM is considering a weight reduction of the M3 Carl Gustaf System.     The  <br> overall weight reduction of the M3 would be a minimum of 3 lbs. with a desired  <br> weight reduction of 5 lbs.  The weight reduction would need to be accomplished  <br> without affecting the overall Center of Gravity (CG) of the rifle.  In addition, a  <br> overall length reduction of approximately 3 inches is sought. The lightening of the  <br> M3 shall not affect its safety or ruggedness when exposed to the rigors normally  <br> associated with military operations, including air delivery and salt water  <br> submersion. A fully developed kit with production configuration would be delivered  <br> no later than 16 months from the onset of performing the desired tasks.     <br>  <br> All responses to this survey must be in Microsoft Office compatible form in the  <br> English language and no longer than 25 total pages including all diagrams, drawing,  <br> etc. All respondents to this market survey shall provide the following: <br>  <br>   Item production status or how each system's length and weight will be reduced.  <br>   Information regarding the design, fabrication and tests already conducted or to  <br> be conducted to validate the design.  <br>   Component compatibility with the Saab Dynamics M3 Carl Gustaf system must be  <br> specifically addressed.   <br>   Actual or expected production unit costs for each kit.  <br>   If development is required, projections of development costs shall be provided.    <br>   Anticipated time required to deliver fifteen sets of test items. <br>  <br> This market survey is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a  <br> Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government. A TDP is  <br> not available in support of this announcement.  <br>  <br> Interested sources shall provide all information by 10 April 2013 by electronic  <br> mail only to Michael Duffy at michael.j.duffy74.civ@mail.mil. All information is to  <br> be submitted at no cost to the Government. The Government is not obligated to  <br> notify respondents of the results of this market survey.

<DESC>1.  INTRODUCTION: This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) notice for planning purposes. This RFI does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS) will take procurement action in this matter.  Any company decision to participate or not participate in this RFI has no future contract advantage or disadvantage either way. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.  This RFI notice is being issued for the purpose of assessing industries' current capabilities in providing solar energy systems mountable on ISO containers/shelters for use by military services in various theaters of operations including base camps.  Any information provided does not constitute a proposal, but will be considered an exchange of capabilities and ideas. Neither PM FSS nor the Government will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information.  <br>  <br> 2.  BACKGROUND:  The remote locations of base camps create significant challenges for logistics support of combat operations.  These base camps are heavily dependent on large, long-distance truck convoys whose cargo is dominated by water and bulk fuel.  Convoy routes through unsecured areas are frequently hazardous, and transport is always expensive.   <br>  <br> 3.  PURPOSE: PM FSS is interested in learning what solar technology power systems mounted on various size ISO containers/shelters, are available today that would enhance operational energy efficiency and logistics sustainability of expeditionary base camps. This RFI focuses on solar power energy technologies and equipment that would address operational energy efficiency in support the military field operations and base camps.  Information received and any product assessment made from this RFI will be used to identify potential technical solutions suitable for rapidly enhancing energy-related base camp operations.  Primary functional uses of these systems will be to provide usable electricity for powering equipment supporting billeting, command and control, dining, office configurations, and medical facilities.  Systems of interest are those that would most effectively reduce the operational energy and fuel demand of a base camp supporting 150 personnel and smaller.  These same technologies would also be considered for base camps supporting 600 personnel and greater.   <br>  <br> 4.  DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCTS SOUGHT:  Integrated solar technology energy source system solutions with battery storage, mountable on top of military ISO containers/shelters, are sought to provide an on-site power generation/distribution system with management capabilities to help reduce the reliance on liquid fuels/fuel demand and improve energy efficiency for military base camp operations.   <br>  <br>    a. A complete integrated system utilizing mature technologies, products and equipment that provides the following capabilities of interest is desired. <br>  <br>    b. Integrated solar energy system that can be securely attached, with minimal effort by the personnel, to top of ISO containers/shelters without any modifications to the ISO container/shelter.  For example, utilize the ISO twist locks located on top of the ISO container/shelter. <br>  <br>    c. The base system design should not increase the footprint beyond that of the ISO container itself.  Expandable roof panels beyond the ISO container footprint are allowed to increase energy production, but a base system must be included in the presentation. <br>  <br>    d. System designed to withstand rough handling in military environment by the incorporation of protective design elements.  <br>  <br>    e. System provides Photovoltaic Energy capture with the following capabilities: <br>  <br>      1) Withstand ballistic damage and remain operational (reduced power output allowed). <br>      2) Provide energy output greater than 1200 watts per ISO Container (8 ft x 8 ft x 20 ft) footprint. <br>  <br>    f. Optional: Solar panels which tilt to better match sun angle. <br>  <br>      1) Threshold: Fixed angle <br>      2) Objective A:  1 axis of tilt <br>      3) Objective B:  2 axis of tilt <br>  <br>    g. System provides Energy Storage Capacity between 5 kWH to 30 kWH is desirable, greater than 30 kWH is allowed. <br>  <br>    h. Power Output and Power Feed Through Capability.  The system needs to output the following, while providing the ability to feed through outside power, when the internal energy is depleted.  Instead of the connecting generator power directly to the load, the operator connects generator power to the CSPS which connects to load. <br>  <br>      1) Objective: 208/120 VAC, three phase (single usable also) <br>      2) Threshold 120 VAC, single phase <br>  <br>    i. Master and Servant operation is allowed.  In this situation, the master system contains the energy storage, and inverters to convert solar and other renewable to 208/120 VAC three phase (Objective) or 120 VAC single phase (Threshold).  The servant systems must contain the renewable energy sources and feed this back to the master.  The master would accept outside generator power and feed this through to master ISO container and all servant ISO containers. <br>  <br>    j. Material Handling Equipment.  System can be moved by Army All Terrain forklifts (weight no more than 10,000 lbs) and commercial forklifts. <br>  <br>      1) Transport Mode.  System is multi-stackable into form factor of Standard 8 ft high ISO Container.  Please note 8.5 ft high is not allowed due to military airlift requirements (C-130 aircraft).  The stacked set of CSPS units must meet the CSC (International Convention for Safe Containers) except for the stacking requirement.  The stacking requirement is number of 8 ft x 8 ft x 20 ft shipping containers (each approximately 63,000 lbs) which can be locked on top CSPS stack to allow maximum use of ISO container ships. <br>  <br>        a) Objective:  9 High Stacking (8 x ~63,000 lbs = ~496,000 lbs) <br>        b) Threshold: 8 High Stacking (7 x ~63,000 lbs = ~441,000 lbs) <br>  <br>      2) If proposed system uses Lithium Ion Batteries as its energy source, please discuss how U.S. Department of Transportation requirements impact your system's stackability during transport.  U.S. Department of Transportation requires Lithium Ion Batteries be shipped in a separate container. <br>  <br> 5.  CONTENT AND FORMAT OF PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS:  The electronic copy of responses is to be in Microsoft Word 2003, Microsoft Word 2007 or Adobe Acrobat 9 compatible format using a size 12 font with one inch margins. Following a review of the responses received, PM FSS may elect to request additional information, or schedule one-on-one meetings with some respondents to gain additional information about their proposed solution(s).  <br>  <br> 6.

FDA's Center for Tobacco Products ("CTP" hereinafter) implements PL 111-31 and H.R. 1256, Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, which was signed into law on June 22, 2009. The Tobacco Control Act granted FDA important new authority to regulate the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products to protect the public health. Since tobacco products are not regulated as drugs, their effects on human behavior and pharmacology have not been evaluated by FDA. The Contractor will provide scientific support necessary to assist in the implementation of this law under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act <br />Specifically the contractor will assist FDA by assessing tobacco product pharmacology and human dependence behaviors in healthy volunteer male and female tobacco users.<br />The Office of Science Center for Tobacco Products (CTP), therefore, plans to initiate a series of clinical studies to evaluate the impact of tobacco products on human behavior and pharmacology. The first study will evaluate the dependence, craving, withdrawal relief and choice behavior in healthy adult male and female cigar smokers before and after smoking their usual type and brand of cigar. The contractor will also measure physiological effects, including blood pressure and heart rate, as well as biomarkers of exposure (including nicotine, cotinine, CO, NNAL) before and after cigar smoking.

Studies will assess the impacts of tobacco products on dependence, craving, withdrawal relief, choice behavior, physiological effects, and measurement of biomarkers of exposure (e.g., nicotine, cotinine, CO, TSNAs). Data collected under this contract will inform FDA on the behavioral and pharmacological effects associated with tobacco product use, and may guide tobacco product policies and regulations. <br />Contractor Requirements: Contractors must respond to all of the following points, by indicating your experience and capability:<br />1.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. <br />
<p><strong>Background:<br /></strong>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) investigators utilize many rodent models (e.g. transgenic, knockout and mutant mice) as model systems to explore how human health and human disease are caused by the interaction of environment and individual susceptibility over time. The NIEHS maintains many genetically distinct laboratory animals utilized for this research. The validation and verification of the genotype of these animals is of critical importance to NIEHS investigators. Therefore, a genetic monitoring contract is needed to provide a rapid and accurate determination of the genotype of each animal. This will be accomplished by awarding a single or multiple contracts to perform one or more DNA-based methods to determine the genotype of each animal sample and provide that information in a form acceptable to NIEHS investigators.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives:<br /></strong>To accomplish project goals a Genotyping Support Contract will provide for DNA extraction from submitted specimens and accompanying bioinformatics support. The majority of the biological samples will be rodent tail clip or ear punch samples. However, the scope of samples that could be analyzed under the contract will be wide-ranging. For example, target organs of interest, such as but not limited to liver or kidney could be of interest to be analyzed. Other sample types for analysis could include isolated or culture cells, various bio-fluids like serum or urine, various organs or tissues, normal or neoplastic tissues, or formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. In addition to rodent species, samples could be derived from other species.</p>
<p><strong>Project Requirements:<br /></strong>The contractor shall supply all necessary labor, materials, equipment, facilities and supplies under the terms of this contract, to perform the following tasks:</p>
<p>The contractor shall:<br />1. Determine the genotype of interest in animals with a DNA-based testing method that utilizes suitable high throughput DNA genotyping techniques including but not limited to PCR-based approaches (i.e. PCR, RT-PCR, Fragment Analysis).</p>
<p>2. Provide all necessary sample collection material for the shipment of samples including but not limited to: sample collection plate or vial, refrigerated sample storage method of samples prior to genotype analysis, appropriate pre-paid shipping containers, and a sample record tracking system/method.</p>
<p>3. Isolate DNA from tail clips, ear punch or other biological samples which may include but are not limited to specific organ tissue or blood. All available specimen information will be provided to the contractor prior to analysis. Samples will be furnished by the Government and sent at a rate ranging from 2,000 to 8,000 per month with an estimated average of approximately 5,000 samples per month. The contractor shall genotype the sample for the specific mutation or genetic alteration as directed by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) or Principal Investigator from NIEHS.</p>
<p>4. Store all samples and leftover DNA from these tests for a minimum of six months and return them to the NIEHS COR or Principal Investigator when requested. Samples may be disposed of by the contractor only after obtaining written approval from the COR and NIEHS Investigator.</p>
<p>5. Report all testing results along with relevant data to both the COR and the individual NIEHS Investigator electronically as accumulated, using Excel spreadsheets, within a maximum turn-around time of 72 hours after the DNA sample has been shipped out from NIEHS. Results that deviate from those expected by the Project Officer COR shall be re-done. If the results are still other than those expected by the Project Officer COR, the contractor must immediately report the findings to the Project Officer COR and the individual NIEHS Investigator via telephone and/or e-mail.</p>
<p>6. Provide reproducible assay(s) for each genotype to determine the necessary information for its proper identification. Some sample genotypes may require more than one assay for identification of the correct genotype. Any and all assay developmental information including but not limited to reagent formulations, methodology, protocols, instrumentation type used and all settings and calibrations of instrument regarding each assay shall be reported to the COR and NIEHS Investigator within 24 hours of written request from NIEHS once the reproducible assay is made. NIEHS retains the right to use these assays for any future purposes.</p>
<p>7. In the case of a failure of a genotyping assay to accurately determine the necessary information for proper genotype identification, the contractor shall repeat the assay for that sample. The contractor shall include in all assays a quality control scheme for monitoring the success rate of the genotyping assays, such as but not limited to random replicates or spike-in control samples. The contractor shall provide back-up methods of testing to be available to be performed on problem samples, as requested by the COR to validate genotyping results. This may include but is not limited to DNA sequencing of the genotype in some samples.</p>
<p>8. Samples for genotyping and ancillary studies will focus on but not be limited to rodent tissue. The contractor will receive suitable specimens and all available sample information from NIEHS to perform their analysis. The contractor shall isolate DNA at the request and direction of NIEHS, using a method approved by the COR. Sample preparation and the specific type of analysis to be performed shall be decided on by NIEHS in discussion with the contractor consistent with the technology platforms in the contract.</p>
<p>9. As directed by the COR, validate experimental observations, such as but not limited to gene expression findings, based on additional replicates and targeted re-genotyping. Sample preparation and the specific type of analysis to be performed will be decided by the COR and the NIEHS Investigator in discussion with the contractor, consistent with the technology platforms in the Statement of Work (SOW).</p>
<p>10. Maintain the confidentiality of the genotyping data and provide secure backup of all data essential to the contract, including but not limited to all genotyping data generated, sample tracking and storage information, and QC information.</p>
<p><strong>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:<br /></strong>The anticipated start date of the award is September 23, 2013. The planned total period of performance is five (5) years.</p>
<p><strong>CAPABILITY STATEMENT:<br /></strong>Interested small businesses should submit information regarding their: (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts or grants, references, and other related information; and (d) respondents' DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HUBZone, etc.) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code.

<CONTACT>Katya Oxley (757)322-4735, katya.oxley@navy.mil
<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE only. This is not a solicitation announcement. No contract will be awarded from this announcement, and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement. This announcement is for information and planning purposes to determine the availability of sources prior to issuing an RFP.  All small businesses as well as large businesses are encouraged to respond. In preparation for a future procurement, the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Atlantic is performing this market research to aid in the development of its acquisition approach.

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to identify companies with the capacity, experience, and interest in competing for the following scope:

Maximo Item Master Record Reconciliation and Description Guidance Project - The intent of this requirement is twofold.
  Part one is to take the existing item list within Maximo and match the records with corresponding items in the National Stock Number (NSN) database and the Local Stock Number (LSN) database in an effort to provide consistent item descriptions.  Part two is to develop description guidance that will be utilized by Maximo users for the creation of future items that need to be added to the Item Master List.
  
The NAICS code for this proposed procurement is 518210 (size standard is $ 30 M).

Background

Naval Facilities Engineering Command has used IBMs Maximo software for a number of years to help manage facility operations and maintenance issues throughout all ten Facility Engineering Commands (FEC) worldwide to include Facilities Maintenance and Sustainment (FM&S), Utilities and Energy Management (UEM) and Base Support Vehicles and Equipment.
  Prior to 2011, each FEC maintained their individual Item Master Records in Maximo for purchasing materials.  This enabled each FEC the ability to create Item Master Records without following any standard methodology.  With the rollout of Maximo 7.1 in 2011, these individual Item Master Records were combined to create one material database.  To date, there are upwards of 1.2 million item master records in the material database.

Of the 1.2 million items comprising the Item Master Records, there are numerous duplicate records for the same items containing varying degrees of information.  Some records contain National Stock Numbers (NSN) or Local Stock Numbers (LSN) however there are many records where this data is missing.
  The number of duplicate records and records with incomplete data is causing material ordering delays that are affecting workplace efficiency and preventing work orders from being completed within acceptable timeframes.  The Maximo Item Master Record Reconciliation and Description Guidance Project will focus on achieving utilization of consistent item numbers and descriptions within the inventory and purchasing applications of Maximo.  The project will focus on NAVFAC MID-ATLANTIC as a beta site, however, the resulting item list and guidance will be available to all regions within NAVFAC.

Statement of Capabilities Submittal Requirements:  The Statement of Capabilities (SOC) will determine the feasibility and/or basis for the Navys decision to proceed with an acquisition.
  Interested firms must submit a SOC, which describes, in detail, the firms capability of providing these services.  The following information must be provided as part of your SOC:
1.  Name and Address of Firm.
2.  Point of Contact with position title, telephone number and email address.
3.  DUNS Number and brief company profile to include information as to whether or not you are a small business concern.  If a small business concern, please also provide information on which, if any; of the sub-categories of small business (i.e., certified by SBA as a HUBZoneSB; self-certify as either an SDB, WOSB, VOSB, and/or SDVOSB) you qualify. 
4.  Demonstrate knowledge of National Stock Number (NSN) system and provide information on similarly completed projects as required for this procurement.
 
5.  Demonstrate ability to cross reference incomplete Maximo Item Records that do not follow MSN standards with Item Records in compliance with NSN standards. This will include updating incomplete records with sufficient data to be used in Maximo. 
6.  Demonstrate ability to complete Item Master Cleanup scope utilizing specialized software designed for such a task. 
7.  Demonstrate knowledge of Navy Supply Chain system and ability to meet project deadlines and performance periods. 
8.  Any comments or recommendations regarding acquisition methodology or contract type.
The Government reserves the right to request additional information as needed, from any and all respondents;  
The SOC must be complete and sufficiently detailed to allow for a determination of the firms qualifications to perform the defined work.
  The SOC must be on 8 by 11-inch standard paper, single spaced, 12 point font minimum and is limited to 4 (four) single-sided pages (or two (2) double-sided pages).
NOTE: THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CANCEL THIS ACQUISTION AT ANY TIME. THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY COSTS INCURRED IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROCESS. ALL INFORMATION SUBMITTED IS AT THE OFFERORS OWN EXPENSE.

Responses are due on Thursday, 4 April 2013, by 10:00 A.M. EDT and shall be sent electronically to Katya Oxley at katya.oxley@navy.mil.  Questions regarding this notice may be addressed to Katya Oxley by email at katya.oxley@navy.mil.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI)/Sources Sought (SS) Notice is for market research, information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM) or the US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA). This request for information/sources sought is seeking Small Business sources that can provide a Neural Amplifier system. The Miniumum Essential Charactersistcs for the Neural Amplifier System are as follows: neural amplifier system (including amplifier system and isolated nerve stimulator system) for use in experiments in human subjects to measure activity in sympathetic nerves. The neural amplifier system should be modular and modifiable to the needs of the specific research laboratory. <br />It should include the following modules: The Amplifier Module with two sections: an electrically isolated pre-amplifier, housed in a small remote box, and a variable-gain amplifier. The electrically isolated preamplifier is a precision, low bias current, low noise wide-band device. The amplifier isolation should be 8000 volts isolation test voltage, with an input impedance of 1 Megaohm. The total gain through this circuit should be 1000. The gain of the variable-gain amplifier should be controlled by a "gain" selector over the range of 0 to 99.9. Total gain should be 0 to 99,000-fold (since the total gain through the isolated portion of the circuit should be 1000). The Filter Module should be a band-pass filter with adjustable low and high cutoff frequencies. The low cutoff may be set at 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1, 1.5, 2 or 3 KHz, and the high cutoff may be set to 0.7, 0.85, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 5 or 10 KHz. The Signal Processor &amp; Integrator Module should include a "discriminator". This allows only that portion of the input signal that exceeds the level set by the front-panel "Discriminator Threshold" control to get through. The discriminator should have 0 to +/-10 Volt precision "dead space". This section should also include a "squaring" circuit, which produces the mathematical square of the input signal. The integrator section of this module should directly integrate the full-wave rectified signal, without regard to the Signal Processor. The Audio Module should be an audio power amplifier which supplies up to 7 watts of audio to an external speaker through the front panel. The audio signal source must have a selection capability between the Bandpass Filter Module or Signal Processor outputs with the "source" switch. A volume control is required to adjust the amplitude of the audio output. Power requirements are 220-240 Volts AC. Size: The unit should have the following measurements (in cm): 45 (L) x 37 (W) x 18 (H). The remote box for the pre-amplifier should measure 6 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm.
<p>This announcement is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposal. No contract will be awarded from his announcement. No reimbursement will be made of any costs to provide information in response to this announcement or any follow up information requests. Availability of any formal solicitation will be announced under a separate announcement. This synopsis is for marker research, information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as commitment by the Government. Each response must reference the sources sought title. All proprietary information should be marked as such. Responses will be held confidential if requested. Please submit technical product fact sheets with references for similar or like contracts performed. The references are to include contract number will post of contact. This information is to be submitted to the attention of USAMRAA, Attn: Caitlin Hippensteel, 820 Chandler St. Ft.Deterick, MD 21702. Information may be emailed to: Caitlin.hippensteel@amedd.army.mil. Responses must be received no later than 4 April 2013 at 3:00 PM</p>

4.	SCOPE.  
The existing government transportation personnel and resources are the primary method to transport patients and must be used to the maximum extent possible. Patient transport will be performed by the contractor when government resources are unavailable and other modes of travel (i.e. public transportation, taxi etc.) are ruled out. The government reserves the right to make changes to listed resources prior to contract award and during contract performance.  The contractor is prohibited from using government vehicles to transport beneficiaries and must use privately owned vehicles.  Further, the contractor remains an independent contract.  Thus, the VA retains full authority and control over the decisions effecting the operations of VA travel affairs and supervisory/management status over VA personnel. 

The contractor will need to have the capacity to schedule up to 2,200 trips a month and handle significant fluctuations in actual trips (as low as 1,300).  The contract company can expect trips to average 1,500 per month.  The contractor must be able to handle a similar number of trips per month in fiscal year 2013-2014.  The VA experiences seasonal and demand changes that the contract company must respond to and accommodate.  The actual trips less cancelations will vary and reduce the projected pickups.  The actual trips less cancelations will vary and reduce the projected pickups.  The trips include wheelchair, scooter, non-ambulatory and ambulatory patients of the hospital. The transportation service will primarily be conducted in the eastern MA area, 24 hours a day (including holidays), 7 days a week.  The transportation company will need to provide transports throughout New England, which will include trips to rural/remote areas of region (ex. Trips to Canadian border, Nantucket, etc), short mileage trips in central/western MA.  The transportation cost is from point of pick up to drop off location. The transport company must be able to transport all veterans regardless of size or weight.  As mobility devices continue to be upgraded and improved (to accommodate increased weight and size),  the contract company will need to remain abreast of these changes and upgrades and have vehicles and staff to meet the transportation needs of the Veteran population. 


The department runs shuttle service between its main facilities and Community Based Outpatient Clinics Monday through Friday.  The service requires drivers to have a CDL with passenger endorsements.  The service should include wheelchair accessible services as requested.  As the Veteran population changes the shuttle needs will change and the company accommodate the population.  

To the maximum extent possible, the contractor shall utilize all VA personnel that the VA makes available to the contractor to perform the contract.  The contractor shall not maintain any control or make any changes to VA personnel policies and matters.
The contractor shall provide, at its own expense, all other personnel requirements to perform the contract.  Such employees shall not be employees of the VA.
The contractor and subcontractors under the supervision of the contractor shall perform the entire contract services required hereunder.  All personnel engaged in the performance of this contract shall be fully qualified to perform such contract services.
The contractor shall assign a project manager and key personnel to the contact.  If the contractor terminates their employment or if the VA requests their removal, the contractor shall reassign personnel to the position within seven days of such action.  The VA shall have the right to approve new key personnel to the contractor, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

All contracted employees are subject to appropriate background investigations and Federal HIPPA and VA information security regulations.      

5.	Period of Performance.  The ANTICIPATED period of performance shall be from the date of award for a base period of one year, with four (one year) option periods. 

6.	Place of Performance.  The offeror's dispatch work will be performed at the VAMC Jamaica Plain in conjunction with the VA transportation employees.

"	Contractors must have a record of paratransit patient/customer satisfaction as surveyed. 

"	Contractors must have a quality assurance plan for paratransit operations. 

"	Drivers should hold a valid TSA badge and all necessary permits for Massport property access.

"	The contractor must confirm appointments 24 hours in advance with the client. If a driver responds to a call that has been cancelled by the client and it is discovered that the confirmation call was not made in advance no invoice will be accepted for payment. 

"	Expected Personnel: Operations Supervisor, Dispatcher, Safety and Account manager (on site at facility).  All personnel must be included in the offeror's proposal to ensure full coverage.

<DESC>This notice issued by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Lyndon B.  Johnson Space Center (JSC), Houston, Texas is a Request for Information (RFI) to determine the feasibility of utilizing NASA/JSCs C-9 Aircraft if it were to be furnished as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) for various missions.  NASAs C-9 aircraft is currently configured for and certified by NASA for microgravity flights.  Microgravity flights provide a unique "reduced gravity" or "zero-g" environment for microgravity research (in areas such as fluid physics, combustion, material sciences, and life sciences), engineering development (for the International Space Station and other space hardware programs) and astronaut flight crew training. NASAs C-9 aircraft is operated as a public use aircraft.  Specific information related to Public Use Aircraft is as follows: Public Use Aircraft Public law requires that any aircraft used by NASA to conduct aeronautical research be operated as a Public Use aircraft.  NASA is therefore responsible to ensure the overall safety of the Contractors aircraft operations and maintenance.  The Contractor shall operate and maintain the aircraft per NASAs aircraft safety and mission assurance standards and in accordance with the NASA approved maintenance program for the aircraft. The NASA maintenance program is substantially the same as a commercial program of graduated maintenance, but with additional inspections and standards appropriate to the NASA mission.  As a Public Use aircraft, NASA may approve any deviations as needed for NASA research or support missions in accordance with Public Use limitations and opportunities. NASAs C-9 aircraft is currently hangared at the Ellington Field NASA Facility in Houston, located near the Johnson Space Center. General information on the aircraft and requirements for the current mission, microgravity services, are included as Attachment 1.  A general description of the configuration and capabilities of NASAs C-9 is included as Attachment 2.  Interested parties having the required specialized capabilities to meet the requirements must submit a capability statement.  All maintenance and operational actions required to support the microgravity service mission and other missions that could be provided by the GFE aircraft should be addressed in the capability statement.  The Capability Statement should address the following: 1.  Does your organization have the capability to provide the services utilizing the GFE Aircraft?  If so, please describe your capabilities and performance history.  2.  How would you manage a microgravity program including maintenance and operation of the aircraft; customer support; and payload integration?  3  What are the risks and rewards that would be shared by the Government and industry for providing the aircraft as GFE? 4.  What, if any, are the barriers to utilizing the GFE Aircraft?  Include how you would eliminate or mitigate potential barriers to utilizing the GFE Aircraft as other than a Public Aircraft.  5.  Considering the aircraft is a Public Aircraft, what other missions could you support and how? Include ideas and recommendations on how the GFE Aircraft might be utilized. 6.  What, if anything, would you require from NASA in order to provide microgravity services and other proposed services using the GFE Aircraft?  7.  What other recommendations or suggestions do you have on how to utilize the GFE Aircraft?  Responses must include the following: 1. Name and address of firm and the name of the author of the suggestions. 2. Size of business; average annual revenue for the past three years and number of employees. 3. Whether the firm is a large business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, HUBZone Small Business, Women Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, or one of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities/Minority Institutions. 4. Number of years in business. 5. Affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners and potential teaming partners. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government is under no obligation to issue a solicitation or to award any contract on the basis of this RFI. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.  This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  This document is for information purposes only to allow industry the opportunity to submit ideas and recommendations on the feasibility of utilizing the GFE NASA/JSC C-9 Aircraft to provide microgravity flight support and/or other services.  NASA will not affirmatively release any information received in response to this RFI to the public, but may use information received in developing the best approach for a contract strategy.  Any information submitted in response to this RFI that is marked as Confidential Commercial or Financial Information will be considered as voluntarily submitted in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act.

<p><br />c. Information sought</p>
<p>1.	Information on technologies/assays currently available for screening critical pathways involved in neurotoxicity where the endpoint is associated with a phenotypic manifestation of toxicity in vivo (adverse outcome)</p>
<p>a.	The preferred technologies/assays will have the ability to batch screen sets of at least 20 compounds to produce a concentration response curve suitable for defining the potency and efficacy of a response and will have been demonstrated to be both reliable and relevant.<br />b.	Assay specifics requested include information on the robustness of the assay and dose-response and time-course toxicity profiles, as well as to what extent the assay informs on specific neurotoxicity life stages windows (i.e., developmental, juvenile, ageing .</p>
<p>2.	Information on assays that can be used to measure the activity of a compound on a molecular initiating event or key event within a neurotoxicity adverse outcome pathway.</p>
<p>3.	Information on the best molecular or cellular targets that accurately characterize the activity of a compound within a specific pathway resulting in an adverse neurotoxic outcome.</p>
<p>4.	Information on assays, technologies, or methods that will aid in identifying neurotoxic compounds, which are activated or deactivated by metabolic activity.</p>
<p>5.	Opinions regarding the difficulty and/or feasibility of the potential requirement and/or proposed acquisition (such as contract type, pricing, etc.), possible solutions and approaches that may currently exist in the marketplace, and information regarding innovative ideas or concepts.</p>
<p>6.	General information, which estimates the effort or time that may be required for an experienced organization to complete the work, identified above.  Note: this information is for planning purposes only, DO NOT include detailed estimates.</p>
<p>7.	Respondents are asked to provide the following: DUNS number, organization name, address, technical and administrative points of contact (including names, titles, addresses, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail address), NAICS code, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HUBZone, WOSB, SDVOSB, etc.).</p>
<p>8.	Information packets should not exceed one (1) page in length, excluding standard brochures. Telephone and facsimile responses will not be accepted. Electronic or hard-copy (4 copies) information packages are acceptable. Electronic information shall be in Microsoft Word, Adobe PDF, Microsoft Power Point, or other Microsoft compatible format sufficient to clearly read the information provided (electronic submitters need only send one copy) to barbourp@niehs.nih.gov.</p>
<p>9.	Please include a cover page, identify the technical and administrative points of contact for the organization, including names, titles, addresses, telephone and fax numbers, e-mail addresses, and organization name.</p>
<p>10.	Information packages shall be submitted for receipt within (30) days from the date of the announcement, April 26, 2013 at 4:30 pm EST.</p>
<p>d. Disclaimer and Important Notes<br />This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed. Information provided will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for the potential requirement and may lead to the development of a solicitation. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted.</p>
<p>Any solicitation resulting from the analysis of information obtained will be announced to the public in Federal Business Opportunities in accordance with FAR Part 5.  Responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to a solicitation.</p>

<DESC>Sought by this announcement are potential performers to provide novel subsystems and components in support of the GBAD DE OTM Future Naval Capability (FNC). This FNC will demonstrate a vehicle-mounted on-the-move short-range air-defense laser system to defeat Low Observable/Low Radar Cross Section (LO/LRCS) threats to a Marine Corps Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF). Shortfalls of the Marine Corps' current low-altitude air-defense program of record have been identified with the advent of new threats, specifically Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs). Threat UASs may have surveillance weapon payloads. The need for a new expeditionary mobile air-defense weapon with improved effectiveness has been identified. GBAD DE OTM will provide close-in, low-altitude, surface-to-air weapons fire in defense of MAGTF assets against LO/LRCS threats. GBAD DE OTM's mission is to prevent reconnaissance, surveillance, targeting, and engagement of expeditionary forces.

<DESC><strong>Intent to Sole Source an award to re-establish an Architect-Engineer (A/E) contract between AMEC Environmental &amp; Infrastructure Inc (AMEC) and the General Services Administration (GSA).</strong>
<p>The General Services Administration, Public Building Service, Boston Service Center, Boston, MA intends to issue a sole source award in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 to re-establish Contract GS-01P-09-BW-D-0082, an Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Architect Engineering Contract to provide professional engineering and design services on an as-needed basis to GSA's New England Region.</p>
<p>Typical task orders issued under the intended contract include: interior space alterations; furnishing partial and/or complete design or survey services which may involve all disciplines or one or more disciplines including, but not limited to, architectural, structural, civil, fire protection engineering, estimating, mechanical, electrical, geotechnical, asbestos, landscaping; interior engineering services for reports, investigations, planning, programming, subsoil investigations, site surveys, and analysis, site utility studies, geotechnical engineering services, environmental studies, estimating and cost/pricing services, energy studies/audits, pre-design services, program/project development, design concepts, design development documents, construction documents, construction inspection/ services, post construction contract services (shop drawing review), materials and other related documents when so authorized by execution of firm fixed price delivery orders. In addition, project management and inspection services will be included as an option on projects designated.</p>
<p>The original IDIQ contract was awarded in September 15, 2009 for professional design service as one of four (4) multiple award contracts from the same solicitation. The other three IDIQ contracts under the multiple award were GS-01P-09-BW-D-0033; GS-01P-09-BW-D-0036 and GS-01P-09-BW-D-0037. The basis of the contract award was competition under Brooks Act Procedures in FAR 36.6. The contract was awarded as a one (1) year base period and four (4) one-year option periods. The option periods were evaluated as part of the initial competition to be exercised at the rates specified in the basic contract as evaluated and negotiated at time of award.</p>
<p>The Government fully intended to exercise Option Year 3 for all four of the multiple awards since there was a continued need for the capacity and current mix of technical qualifications of all four multiple awardees. However, the current contract Option Year expired in September 2012 due to an administrative oversight.</p>
<p>The proposed new contract action would serve to reestablish the third and fourth option period of IDIQ contract with AMEC to include all the terms and conditions under the GS-01P-09-BW-D-0082 IDIQ contract. Although a continuation of an old contract, this will be assigned a new contract number.</p>
<p>In order to maintain the Fair Opportunity to all four IDIQ holders as required by the terms of the IDIQ and to allow the Government the capability to choose the most highly qualified firm of the four IDIQ awards under the multiple award contract in accordance with FAR 36.6, the AMEC IDIQ award must be reestablished. Additionally, AMECs performance, just like that of the other three ID/IQ contract holders, has been deemed satisfactory to date.</p>
<p>AMEC has been performing these services since 2009 and is fully capable of continuing to perform for the current Option Year and remaining additional Option Year.</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C 253 (c)(1) as cited in FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, as no solicitation package will be issued. However, if a firm believes it can meet these requirements within the prescribed time frame with, it may give notification via e-mail to Simeon Berry, Contracting Officer, at Simeon.Berry@gsa.gov no later than April 12th, 2013, 10:00 a.m., EST. The Government will review all responses, without prejudice; whether or not the Government initially determines that another firm is fully qualified to fulfill the requirements.</p>

Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B) Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/. In addition, complete the following Addendum I to 52.212-3:<br /><br />52.212-3 Addendum, Certification to Accept the Government Purchase Card (GPC). If the Government's intent for payment is via the GPC IAW clauses 52.232-36 and 52.212-4, Addendum, paragraph (i) (3), the Offeror must certify that it:<br />( ) (i) will accept the GPC for payments under this contract.<br />( ) (ii) will not accept the GPC for payments under this contract.</p>
<p>(xi) Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority (SPCOA) , or Certificate of Operating Authority (COA)) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.</p>
<p>(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs, rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4) The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) "Work Orders" is added as follows: Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(End of Addendum to Clause 52.212-4)</p>

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B) Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/. In addition, complete the following Addendum I to 52.212-3:<br /><br />52.212-3 Addendum, Certification to Accept the Government Purchase Card (GPC).

The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification.

If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. <br>  <br> HQ Army Materiel Command  <br> Office of Command Counsel <br> 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 <br> Ft.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>The award decision is based on evaluation factors that are tailored to the acquisition. Evaluation Factors: Lowest Price Technically Acceptable <BR> <BR>The Government reserves the right to increase and decrease the Period of Performance dates due to mission requirement. In the event this happens, the Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor within 12-24 hours to make adjustments accordingly. The Government will not be charged for mission changes. <BR> <BR>As identified in Question Submission, "questions not received in a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered" are defined FOR THIS SOLICITATION as: THE CUTOFF TIME FOR RECEIPT OF QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SOLICITATION IS Monday 8 April 2013 AT 1300EST . ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered. <BR> <BR>

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<p>The provision at FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items is applicable to this solicitation. The specific evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (1) of that provision are as follows:</p>
<p>The government will award the purchase order to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government on a best value evaluation basis, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(i) Technical capability of the services offered to meet the Government's requirement.<br />(ii) Past Performance. <br />(iii) Price.</p>
<p>When combined, Technical capability and past performance are significantly more important when compared to price in determining the best value to the government; however, price remains a significant factor.</p>
<p>Technical capability will be determined and evaluated by review of information submitted by the quoter, which must provide a description in sufficient detail to show that the proposed system and PM services quoted meet the Government's requirements as outlined is this combined synopsis/solicitation. Offerors shall specifically address each of the minimum performance requirements stated above to demonstrate that the proposal meets the technical requirements.</p>
<p>Past Performance will be determined and evaluated by review of information submitted by the quoter and/or other sources of information (e.g., the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), etc.). Information submitted by the quoter should describe experiences with the OEM equipment in general, and specifically, the instruments (hardware and software) to be maintained under this requirement; OEM supply chain experience; and experience providing PM in a lab environment.</p>
<p>Price proposed must be detailed and represent the quoter's response to the schedule of services above.</p>

Quotes shall include technical specifications, descriptive material, literature, brochures and other information corresponding to each minimum required item, which demonstrates the capabilities of the offeror.</p>
<p>Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total <br />price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may <br />determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly <br />unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the <br />option(s).</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-3 Offerors Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (APR 2012).</p>
<p>An offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically via http://www.acquisition.gov/. If an offeror has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at the ORCA website, the offeror shall complete only paragraphs (c) through (o) of this provision.</p>
<p>The offeror agrees to hold the prices firm until September 30, 2013.</p>
<p>The Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) and assigned rating are not applicable to this solicitation notice.</p>
<p>It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the internet site for the release of an amendment to the combined synopsis/solicitation (if any).</p>
<p>Offerors that fail to complete the required representations and certifications, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation, may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, in order to be considered for an award of a Federal contract, the contractor must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM), a free web site that encompasses the capabilities of the - Central Contractor Registry (CCR); Federal Agency Registration (Fedreg); Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA); Excluded Parties List System (EPLS); and the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance. The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. To access the SAM website go to: https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/</p>
<p><br />Addendum to Paragraph (b) (8) Representations and Certifications- In addition to completing the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3(b), the Contractor's quote shall also clearly show that the Contractor has selected the appropriate certification under FAR 52.222-48.</p>
<p>Note: This solicitation is being issued under the premise that the Contractor will certify that the combination of equipment/service it will propose to fulfill this requirement is exempt from the Service Contract Act per the conditions set forth in FAR 52.222-48 &amp; FAR 22.1003-4(c). If this is the case and the Contractor certifies that is exempt under the terms and conditions of 52.222-48, then clause 52.222-51 will flow per usual from this solicitation to the resulting order. In the event that a Contractor does not make this certification, traditional Service Contract Act clauses 52.222-41, and 52.222-43 shall be included in the resulting order award as well as Wage Determination WD 05-2103 (Rev.-12: http://www.wdol.gov/wdol/scafiles/std/05-2103.txt?v=12</p>
<p>The provision at FAR 52.222-48, Exemption from application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment Certification (Feb 2009), applies to this acquisition:</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p><br />BASIS FOR AWARD:<br />Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the combined Synopsis/Solicitation, offers the lowest evaluated price.</p>
<p><br />SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS <br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>
<p>Due to enhanced security measures, ship and base access is required for pre-award ship visits (e.g. ship-check) and for contract performance. Specifically the following permissions are required:</p>
<p>1. El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) personnel screening requirement<br />2. Base/Repair Facility Access Request<br />3. Vehicle Access Request<br />4. Ship Access List (vendor-provided)</p>
<p>All forms are available for download on the MSC contracts webpage at http://www.msc.navy.mil. Click on "Contracts" in the upper right corner. "EPIC template" is under "Reference" subheading. Click on "Online Library of Common Documents" for all other forms.</p>

Complete EPIC form strictly adhering to format requirements and forward to (CONUS East Coast repairs) msc.norfolk.epic@navy.mil <br />(CONUS West Coast and HI repairs) MSC.SSUSD.EPIC@NAVY.MIL. EPIC personnel screening requests are desired seven calendar days prior to performance start date. Requests will be managed as expeditiously as circumstances permit. Vendor will be notified by MSFSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>
<p>Vehicle Access: Required for vehicle access to Navy facilities. Follow supplemental instructions on Base Access forms or base-specific vehicle access forms.</p>
<p>Ship Access List* (Vendor-Provided): On company letterhead attachment via email, the vendor is required to provide the ship master (courtesy copy the Port Engineer) with an accurate, current list of performing personnel prior to being admitted aboard the vessel. Under no circumstances will a hand-delivered list be accepted.</p>

<SUBJECT>Help Desk and Information Technology Support of the NLM's Insight Toolkit (ITK-v4)
<SOLNBR>NIHLM2013694
<RESPDATE>041113
<ARCHDATE>04182013
<CONTACT>Suet Vu, Phone 301-496-6546, Fax 301-402-0642, Email vus@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>Project Purpose<br />In order to continue to provide leadership within the national research community in the area of software development for image analysis, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) seeks to provide help desk and information technology support for its open-source image processing application programmers interface (API), known as the Insight Toolkit (ITK). In 1999, NLM organized a software development program along with support from across NIH, NSF and DoD. The resulting open source software library has become the very successful initiative known as the Insight Toolkit (ITK). ITK operates across multiple computing platforms, supporting many combinations of operating systems and compilers. ITK is currently in use in over 45 countries by thousands of researchers in hundreds of laboratories spanning research topics from traditional medical disciplines such as neurology, pathology, radiology, and oncology, to electron microscopy, systems biology, remote sensing and even astronomy.<br />In a research contract program from 2010 to 2013, NLM revisited the foundations of the toolkit to assure its viability for the next ten years. In the intervening decade since the original design of ITK, computing technologies made radical advances including the advent of multi-core microprocessors, 64-bit CPU architectures, and a proliferation of graphics processing units (GPUs) capable of general purpose computing. The result of the NLM program was a major software release, ITK version 4.0, which targeted these emerging features of contemporary computing.<br />NLM is actively seeking to incubate the revised version of ITK, now in release ITK-v4.3, encouraging users to migrate to the new release and grow the user community. A maintenance award is required to accomplish this goal.<br />General description of the required objectives and desired results<br />The Insight Toolkit (ITK) is currently available with the release, ITK version 4.3, announced in December 2012 (see the URL: http://www.itk.org). NLM wishes to maintain the underlying design and software architecture for ITK as well as support and grow the user community at this time.<br />The purpose of this procurement is to obtain contract software support services for the Insight Toolkit (ITK), the image processing tools initiative of the Visible Human Project. The goal is to support ITK to attempt to allow it to perform and evolve for the research community for up to another five years.<br />All deliverables will be released under the existing ITK license as public, open-source software, and so all deliverables must be free from encumbering licenses or restrictions.<br />NLM intends to select a single contractor to address these issues, with the emphasis on experienced ITK programming talent either from a systems development perspective or from the application developer point of view. All respondents to this announcement are encouraged to assemble expert teams, and subcontracting and consulting relationships are permitted as part of any proposed award. The period of performance for any award is one (1) year, with possible options for four (4) additional option years.
<p>Detailed description of the technical requirements. <br />Supporting ITK and its user community as a maintainable and sustainable software toolkit for the next five years is the goal, and it will require a breadth of expertise as well as in-depth knowledge of the existing toolkit and its application programmers interface (API). Potential contractors should have a keen appreciation for the existing community, its needs, and the processes and work-flow of ITK users.<br />NLM encourages the growth of ITK through peer-reviewed software additions. The current mechanism for proposing and evaluating new code is through submissions to the Insight Journal. Respondents should have the technical capability to manage an online journal as well as the subject matter expertise to moderate reviews and discussions of software and data for medical image analysis.<br />Integration is considered the key to success for both this contract action as well as the success of the ITK toolkit in general. All offerors should be prepared to work closely with other NLM contractors and with the existing Insight software community. All software deliverables will be checked-in to the current source code control system and vetted through the style checker and regression testing dashboards currently in place. Respondents to this announcement should demonstrate their proficiency with the software tools and processes in use by the ITK users including GIT and Gerrit as well as their experience supporting user information through wiki pages, mailing lists, and other communication vehicles.<br />The prospective contractor should be able to identify and correct bugs in ITK. This requires extensive knowledge of C++ programming including the use of templates as well as the techniques for providing language bindings for allowing access to ITK software capabilities called through other programming languages. Deep knowledge of the existing ITK-v4.3 code is required. Proficiency in Python, in particular, is considered essential.<br />NLM anticipates that the contractor will travel to promote ITK through one or two symposia, tutorials, and workshops per year held in conjunction with technical conferences where medical image analysis is being discussed. NLM encourages outreach activities with other programming groups and user communities. The contractor should be able to show their demonstrated capacity to organize tutorials and to teach ITK programming.<br />Prospective contractors should not assume that all outreach will be performed under this funding. Rather, the successful contractor will organize and invite other members of the ITK community to join in the presentation of tutorials and workshops promoting ITK.</p>
<p>Subordinate tasks or types of work.<br />The contractor will be required to participate in the following tasks or prepare the following deliverables:<br />1. Maintain and monitor communications with the ITK user community. This includes the running of mailing lists/list-serves and responding user questions and complaints. It also includes conducting and moderating weekly teleconference meetings for ITK developers, keeping minutes and maintaining meeting agendas.<br />2. Identify and correct bugs and other software flaws in ITK.<br />3. Contribute documentation, tutorial materials, and courseware. Organize outreach activities such as one or two symposia, tutorials, or workshops in conjunction with related conferences per year.<br />4. Produce semi-annual software releases of ITK.<br />5. Perform all software and documentation development under the style guidelines and architectural rules of the Insight Toolkit.<br />6. Maintain the ITK software repository using a source code control system. The current distributed revision control and source code management system for ITK is Git. The contractor will support ITK through Git until and unless the ITK developer community adopts a different system.<br />7. Support the quality of ITK software through the use of software code review tools. The current system for software review is Gerrit, a free, web-based team software code review tool that integrates with Git version control software. The contractor will promote software quality in ITK by supporting Gerrit until and unless the ITK developer community adopts a different system.</p>
<p>Quality Control.<br />In keeping with the practices for the development of the current Insight Toolkit, all software deliverables will be required to pass through the ITK dashboard, the open-source system for regression testing and quality control. No deliverables will be considered acceptable without checking in the software to the source code repository, and cleared through the dashboard regression testing process. All software, including examples, must be accompanied by software tests, both run-time and regression test, suitable for implementation in the dashboard system. All deliverables must pass their own tests as well as not break other tests in the toolkit.<br />Coding style and software will be reviewed for style, documentation, completeness, comprehensiveness and coverage of the software tests, and the correctness of the implementation. A web-based team software code review tool will be used (currently Gerrit).</p>
<p>Reporting Requirements.<br />The successful contractor will hold weekly teleconferences, videoconferences, or virtual conferences to provide continuing communication among the ITK developer community. Attendance at these weekly meetings is required for the contractor. Deliverables will be checked-in to a source code repository and testing of deliverables will be covered in an automatic build and regression testing environment. Annual reports of the activity of the contractor and the state of the community are required.</p>
<p>Period of Performance.<br />The period of performance for this requirement is one (1) year. Four options for one year each (4 option years) should be offered with the proposal.</p>
<p>Deliverables.<br />All deliverables will reside in the public domain (either through controlled Internet distribution from the NLM or through a third party electronic publisher), including all source code. The NLM will use the Visible Human Project rights and data clause with this requirement, claiming ownership of all data and software generated under this requirement, including all source code. NLM intends to place the ITK license on all software and release it in the public domain. The eventual software developers will be held to high software standards, and extensive documentation for the software tools (including tutorials, manuals, and examples) are required. All deliverables will be checked-in to a source code repository.</p>

SECTION C - CONTRACT CLAUSES
C.2  52.246-17  WARRANTY OF SUPPLIES OF A NONCOMPLEX NATURE (JUNE 2003) ALTERNATE III  (APR 1984)
  (a) Definitions. As used in this clause--
    "Acceptance" means the act of an authorized representative of the Government by which the Government assumes for itself, or as an agent of another, ownership of existing supplies, or approves specific services as partial or complete performance of the contract.
    "Supplies" means the end items furnished by the Contractor and related services required under this contract. The word does not include "data."
  (b) Contractor's obligations.
    (1) Notwithstanding inspection and acceptance by the Government of supplies furnished under this contract, or any condition of this contract concerning the conclusiveness thereof, the Contractor warrants that for ONE YEAR--
      (i) All supplies furnished under this contract will be free from defects in material or workmanship and will conform with all requirements of this contract; and
      (ii) The preservation, packaging, packing, and marking, and the preparation for, and method of, shipment of such supplies will conform with the requirements of this contract.
    (2) When return, correction, or replacement is required, transportation charges and responsibility for the supplies while in transit shall be borne by the Contractor.  However, the Contractor's liability for the transportation charges shall not exceed an amount equal to the cost of transportation by the usual commercial method of shipment between the place of delivery specified in this contract and the Contractor's plant, and return.
    (3) Any supplies or parts thereof, corrected or furnished in replacement under this clause, shall also be subject to the terms of this clause to the same extent as supplies initially delivered.  The warranty, with respect to supplies or parts thereof, shall be equal in duration to that in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause and shall run from the date of delivery of the corrected or replaced supplies.
    (4) All implied warranties of merchantability and "fitness for a particular purpose" are excluded from any obligation contained in this contract.
  (c) Remedies available to the Government. (1) The Contracting Officer shall give written notice to the Contractor of any breach of warranties in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause within 90 DAYS.
    (2) Within a reasonable time after the notice, the Contracting Officer may either--
      (i) Require, by written notice, the prompt correction or replacement of any supplies or parts thereof (including preservation, packaging, packing, and marking) that do not conform with the requirements of this contract within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this clause; or
      (ii) Retain such supplies and reduce the contract price by an amount equitable under the circumstances.
    (3)(i) If the contract provides for inspection of supplies by sampling procedures, conformance of supplies or components subject to warranty action shall be determined by the applicable sampling procedures in the contract. The Contracting Officer--
        (A) May, for sampling purposes, group any supplies delivered under this contract;
        (B) Shall require the size of the sample to be that required by sampling procedures specified in the contract for the quantity of supplies on which warranty action is proposed;
        (C) May project warranty sampling results over supplies in the same shipment or other supplies contained in other shipments even though all of such supplies are not present at the point of reinspection; provided, that the supplies remaining are reasonably representative of the quantity on which warranty action is proposed; and
        (D) Need not use the same lot size as on original inspection or reconstitute the original inspection lots.
      (ii) Within a reasonable time after notice of any breach of the warranties specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the Contracting Officer may exercise one or more of the following options;
        (A) Require an equitable adjustment in the contract price for any group of supplies.
        (B) Screen the supplies grouped for warranty action under this clause at the Contractor's expense and return all nonconforming supplies to the Contractor for correction or replacement.
        (C) Require the Contractor to screen the supplies at locations designated by the Government within the contiguous United States and to correct or replace all nonconforming supplies.
        (D) Return the supplies grouped for warranty action under this clause to the Contractor (irrespective of the f.o.b. point or the point of acceptance) for screening and correction or replacement.
    (4) If the Contractor does not agree as to responsibility to correct or replace the supplies delivered, the Contractor shall nevertheless proceed in accordance with the written request issued by the Contracting Officer under paragraph (c)(2) of this clause to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies.  In the event it is later determined that the supplies were not defective or nonconforming within the terms and conditions of this clause, the contract price will be equitably adjusted.
    (5) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this clause are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the Government by any other clause of this contract.
(End of Clause) 
C.3   52.247-21  CONTRACTOR LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY AND/OR PROPERTY DAMAGE  (APR 1984)
  (a)  The Contractor assumes responsibility for all damage or injury to persons or property occasioned through the use, maintenance, and operation of the Contractor's vehicles or other equipment by, or the action of, the Contractor or the Contractor's employees and agents.
  (b)  The Contractor, at the Contractor's expense, shall maintain adequate public liability and property damage insurance during the continuance of this contract, insuring the Contractor against all claims for injury or damage.
  (c)  The Contractor shall maintain Workers' Compensation and other legally required insurance with respect to the Contractor's own employees and agents.

Any resultant BPA(s) will be five (5) years in duration. <br>  <br> A BPA is a vehicle that an ordering activity can use to facilitate the acquisition of recurring needs for services or supplies.  BPAs enable ordering activities to prepare for anticipated purchases.  A BPA is not a contract, and although it establishes the terms applicable to the placement of future orders, it does not obligate funds.  When the need becomes immediate, the ordering activity can then make the purchase by simply placing a BPA Call against the BPA.  BPAs do not state a minimum or maximum amount.  Since it is not a contract there are no guarantees that the Government will place any orders against it. <br>  <br> This solicitation number is W91238-13-Q-0021 and the solicitation is being issued as a 100% small business set aside Request for Quote (RFQ) using FAR Part 12 Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202) 372-3695</p>

<p>The solicitation number is OPM2613Q0115 and is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This solicitation document incorporates all mandatory commercial item provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-66 dated February 28, 2013.</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 611430 and the small business size standard is $10.0 million. This procurement is set-aside exclusively for small businesses, allowing only a small business to submit proposals.</p>
<p>The U.S. Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Center for Leadership Development (CLD) provides high quality leadership and management development for supervisors, managers and executives across the Federal government through both multi-agency and single-agency designed courses. OPM has established two leadership institutes, the Federal Executive Institute in Charlottesville (FEI), Virginia, and the Management Development Center's (MDC's) with locations in Shepherdstown, West Virginia and Aurora, Colorado. OPM also offers courses at the OPM Headquarters in Washington, D.C. and at other locations. <br /><br />As a Federal business enterprise, CLD provides services that assist Federal agencies in achieving their missions by providing competency-based leadership programs to build great leaders for great government.</p>
<p>One single-agency course offered by CLD is the Mid-Level Transitions (MLT): Developing Leaders for the Future course for the U.S. Custom and Immigration Services (USCIS). The USCIS MLT teaches the "leadership" aspects of mid-level managers and provides the leadership tools needed to transition successfully into a managerial role. Participants learn critical skills to lead employees, and are assessed for leadership competencies via an OPM 360 degree assessment and one-on-one coaching. Participants are exposed to principles of Managing in Challenging Times, Coaching for Development, Political Savvy, Leading through Power and Influence, Conflict Resolution for Managers, Managing a Virtual Workforce, Managing Change, and working with coaching trios to improve their leadership skills.</p>
<p>In support of its mission, OPM needs to acquire no more than (3) contractors to provide the overall delivery of the USCIS MLT to include: Visiting Program Director (VPD), Instructor, and 360 Coaching services.</p>

DELIVERY/PICKUP AND REFUELING COST MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE QUOTE. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government. The reference website is located at http://www.veterinaryservice.army.mil/sources.html. <BR> <BR>The award decision is based on evaluation factors that are tailored to the acquisition. Evaluation Factors: Lowest Price Technically Acceptable <BR> <BR>The Government reserves the right to increase and decrease the Period of Performance dates due to mission requirement. In the event this happens, the Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor within 12-24 hours to make adjustments accordingly. The Government will not be charged for mission changes. <BR> <BR>As identified in Question Submission, "questions not received in a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered" are defined FOR THIS SOLICITATION as: THE CUTOFF TIME FOR RECEIPT OF QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SOLICITATION IS Monday 8 April 2013 AT 1300EST .

Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.

Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. 

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. ?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

The HQAMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an alternative dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. These procedures apply to the HQAMC-Level Protest Program only. <BR> <BR>?	Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. 
Federal Government employees, unions or installations are not considered interested parties for the purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. 
Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. <BR> <BR>?	Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated. ?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day. ?	Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

?	Required information: Protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester. o	Protester?s name o	Address o	Telephone number o	Fax number o	Solicitation or contract number o	Identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer?s name o	Detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest) o	Copies of all relevant documents o	Request for a ruling o	Request for relief <BR> <BR>?	Where to file: An agency protest may be filed with either the contracting officer or to HQAMC. o	Protest to HQAMC shall be filed at: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 Fax: (703) 806-8866 or 8875 o	Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel Room 2-1SE3401 1412 Jackson Loop Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 o	Protest to Contracting Officer shall be filed at: Appropriate installation address or see FAR Clause 52.233-2 in section L for address. ?	Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. 

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. ?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is a DD254 required<br /><br />Yes. It is now attached to the RFQ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What type of training materials are required?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Should we price the 'standard' materials that we use for AFT training, and provide a description?</p>
<p>Standard training</p>
<p>5.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What type of 'support' is required?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Should we price the 'standard' methodology that we use for AFT support, and provide a description?</p>

<DESC>The United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Army Capabilities Integration Center (ARCIC) continues its Technology Information Exchange program. Since the program's inception in 2004, ARCIC has conducted over 88 TIEs. This effort brings industry/corporate/company representatives together with the TRADOC, ARCIC, Research, Development and Engineering Command, other Army S&T Organizations, and TRADOC Centers of Excellence, for a dialogue on emerging technologies that could support Army Warfighter Outcomes (WFOs). Organizations that participate in TIEs do not receive any financial reimbursement from the U.S. Army.   <br>  <br> TRADOC ARCIC, Concept Development and Learning Directorate, Science & Technology Division, 950 Jefferson Ave, Joint Base Langley-Eustis, VA 23604-5763. <br>  <br> TECHNOLOGY INFORMATION EXCHANGE (TIE) - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).  <br>  <br> TRADOC ARCIC is continuing its TIE program.

Other factors impacting the Government's rights under a prospective lease, such as the length of any firm term that may be required at an alternative location, length of time necessary to deliver occupancy-ready space, and the right to terminate any space vacated during the term, will also bear.</p>
<p>Brokers or agents may represent the prospective landlord, but any properties or proposals submitted by brokers/agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized to represent the building's ownership. If you desire to submit a location for inspection, please forward information by 5:00 PM local Mountain Time, April 12, 2013. Expressions of interest can be accepted by mail, e-mail or fax.

A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. VHA NCO 17 - 671 - South Texas Veterans Health Care System is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids.All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use.

While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>Contractor shall invoice monthly in arrears for all supplies and services rendered to and accepted by the Government. <BR> <BR>The maximum time allotted to delivery and install all furniture on site (Temple, Texas) is 42 Calendar Days after contractor receipt of the Task Order.

<DESC><p>This notice is being posted in reference to a sole-source award to re-establish an Architect-Engineer (A/E) contract between AMEC Environmental &amp; Infrastructure Inc (AMEC) and the General Services Administration (GSA).</p>
<p>AMEC contract GS-01P-09-BW-D-0082 with the GSA is an Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Architect Engineering Contract to provide professional engineering and design services on an as-needed basis to GSA's New England Region.</p>
<p>Typical task orders include: interior space alterations; furnishing partial and/or complete design or survey services which may involve all disciplines or one or more disciplines including, but not limited to, architectural, structural, civil, fire protection engineering, estimating, mechanical, electrical, geotechnical, asbestos, landscaping; interior engineering services for reports, investigations, planning, programming, subsoil investigations, site surveys, and analysis, site utility studies, geotechnical engineering services, environmental studies, estimating and cost/pricing services, energy studies/audits, pre-design services, program/project development, design concepts, design development documents, construction documents, construction inspection/ services, post construction contract services (shop drawing review), materials and other related documents when so authorized by execution of firm fixed price delivery orders. In addition, project management and inspection services will be included as an option on projects designated.</p>
<p>The proposed new contract action would serve to reestablish the third and fourth option period of IDIQ contract with AMEC to include all the terms and conditions under the GS-01P-09-BW-D-0082 IDIQ contract. Although a continuation of an old contract, this will be assigned a new contract number.</p>
<p>The IDIQ was awarded September 15, 2009 for professional design service as one of four (4) multiple award contracts from the same solicitation. The other three IDIQ contracts under the multiple award were GS-01P-09-BW-D-0033; GS-01P-09-BW-D-0036 and GS-01P-09-BW-D-0037. The basis of the contract award was competition under Brooks Act Procedures in FAR 36.6. The contract was awarded as a one (1) year base period and four (4) one-year option periods.</p>
<p>The option periods were evaluated as part of the initial competition to be exercised at the rates specified in the basic contract as evaluated and negotiated at time of award.</p>
<p>The award would be a continuation by the contractor, AMEC Environmental &amp; Infrastructure Inc, under the multiple award IDIQ Contract GS-01P-09-BW-D-0082. The base year of the contract ended on September 13, 2010. Subsequently, Option Year 1 and Option Year 2 were exercised timely in September 2011and 2012 respectively, in accordance with FAR 17.207 Exercise of Options, and FAR Clause 52.217-9, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract. Likewise, Option Year 1 and Option 2 of the other three contracts under the multiple award were also exercised, namely: GS-01P-09-BW-D-0033; GS-01P-09-BW-D-0036 and GS-01P-09-BW-D-0037 IDIQ.</p>
<p>In January 2013, it was discovered that Option Year 3 for contract GS-01P-09-BW-D-0082 had not been exercised. Option Year 3 for the other three IDIQ contracts under the multiple award had been exercised timely, but due to an administrative oversight, the exercise of option for contract GS-01P-09-BW-D-0082 had been missed. The expiration date of Option Year 2 was September 13, 2012.</p>
<p>The Government fully intended to exercise Option Year 3 for all four of the multiple awards since there was a continued need for the capacity and current mix of technical qualifications of all four multiple awardees. The IDIQ multiple award contract provides for Fair Opportunity in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(1). Fair Opportunity for task order award under the IDIQ multiple award contract is consistent with FAR Part 36.6 governing AE services and task order awards are supported via a technical justification for selecting the firm consistent with FAR 36.602-1. Past performance on earlier orders under the contract, including quality, timeliness and cost control; potential impact on other orders placed with the contractor are also considered.</p>
<p>In order to maintain the Fair Opportunity to all four IDIQ holders as required by the terms of the IDIQ and to allow the Government the capability to choose the most highly qualified firm of the four IDIQ awards under the multiple award contract in accordance with FAR 36.6, the AMEC IDIQ award must be reestablished. Additionally, AMECs performance, just like that of the other three ID/IQ contract holders, has been deemed satisfactory to date.</p>
<p>Although the completion date for Option 2 of September 13, 2012 under the AMEC contract had passed, task order GS-P-01-12-BW-5246 was signed on September 27, 2012 against the GS-01P-09-BW-D-0082 contract and performance is ongoing. This is further evidence that not exercising the option was an administrative oversight on the part of the government and was unknown to both the government and AMEC at that time. The administrative matter should not prevent the continuation of the multiple award IDIQ contract relationship with AMEC where there is a still a need for the specific technical qualifications they provide, fair opportunity is being preserved and the action is in the best interest to the Government</p>
<p>Accordingly, the attached Justification is now being posted.</p>
